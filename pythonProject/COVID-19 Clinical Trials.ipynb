    "1. **High-level understanding of data**\n",
    "    - First, I will take down notes about the data from the Kaggle descriptions\n",
    "    - I might also check out the associated notebook to get a better sense\n",
    "2. **Brainstorm some questions** I would like to ask and analyze the data for.\n",
    "    - I will probably also get inspiration from the aforementioned notebook\n",
    "3. **Learn as I go!** Specifically, my goals for this EDA are:\n",
    "    - get more comfortable with working with the basic packages like Numpy and Pandas\n",
    "    - get used to graphing using matplotlib library since that's the most common one\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall timeline goal\n",
    "- Today is February 25, 2021; I would like to finish this project in maximum 1 week, so March 4th at the latest."
