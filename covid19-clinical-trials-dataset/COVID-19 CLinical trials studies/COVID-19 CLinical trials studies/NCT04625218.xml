  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational, open, monocentric multisite, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study of hydroxychloroquine in critically ill patients. The aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic behavior of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 critically ill patients&#xD;
      treated with crushed hydroxychloroquine tablets (administered enterally using a nasogastric&#xD;
      tube).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and preliminary clinical data,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine is currently used in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the meantime,&#xD;
      the efficacy as well as the dosage of hydroxychloroquine is highly debated. Because of the&#xD;
      severity of COVID-19 and the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus patients, a loading dose was rapidly included in the new hospital regimens to&#xD;
      optimize drug distribution in tissues and more precisely in the lungs. Due to the lack of&#xD;
      information on the plasma/blood concentrations required to induce a virological/clinical&#xD;
      effect, plasma/blood concentration is monitored in many European countries for patients&#xD;
      whether or not they are included in clinical research protocols. This problem of relationship&#xD;
      between efficacy and exposure is important in the critically ill patient because both the&#xD;
      bioavailability and the variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters are potentially&#xD;
      responsible for variations in concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, observational, open, multisite, pharmacokinetics study of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine in critically ill patients. There is no supplemental intervention or&#xD;
      additional samples compared to the standard care of these patients in our teaching hospital.&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is that of the duration of hospitalization in intensive care.&#xD;
      The duration of the pharmacokinetic study is 9 days, starting on D1 of the treatment with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, and ending with the last recommended residual plasma control. The total&#xD;
      duration of treatment with hydroxychloroquine is 10 days, as recommended by the High Council&#xD;
      of Public Health in its opinion of March 23, 2020.&#xD;
