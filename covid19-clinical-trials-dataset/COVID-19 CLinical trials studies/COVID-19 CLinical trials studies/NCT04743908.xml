  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This C3 project, Community network-driven COVID-19 testing of vulnerable populations in the&#xD;
      Central US, will implement and evaluate a COVID-19 testing approach that combines an&#xD;
      evidence-based Social Network Testing Strategy (SNS) with community developed COVID-19 public&#xD;
      health messages (SNS+). C3 will engage two disenfranchised populations across rural and urban&#xD;
      sites in states across the Central US (TX, LA, AR, IN, IL). C3 leverages NIDA's Justice&#xD;
      Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN), the PIs' extensive community located COVID-19&#xD;
      testing programs, and a network of established community partnerships. The collaborative&#xD;
      community-academic partnerships, research and engagement infrastructure, and team's&#xD;
      leadership across JCOIN will ensure that C3 can rapidly recruit, enroll and test most&#xD;
      disenfranchised community members, (n=2400) and through this process, accelerate any&#xD;
      forthcoming COVID-19 public health prevention interventions. C3 focuses on two communities&#xD;
      most impacted by COVID-19: 1) Criminal justice involved (CJI) - non-incarcerated people with&#xD;
      previous history of arrest/jail/prison, probation/parole and drug-court attendance; and 2)&#xD;
      Low-income Latinx - community members at 250% or below Federal Poverty Level. Both of these&#xD;
      diverse populations, and the overlap between them, have some of the highest rates of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and death in the United States. Messaging that affirms individual agency and&#xD;
      corrects misinformation, combined with accessible and acceptable testing, is required to&#xD;
      accelerate COVID-19 prevention for these populations&#xD;

    <description>This will occur towards the end of the study visit when CEC staff describe the SNS, construct a plan for successfully referring network members into the study, and discuss compensation for the recruitment efforts. CECs will specifically discuss network members of interest: &quot;friend, family, coworker or someone you spend time with on a regular basis&quot;. Walkthrough and scenario play will be strategies to assist with planning regarding: (1) how the conversation will be raised, (2) how potential barriers to testing will be addressed, (3) how the screening by phone or web survey will be conducted, (4) how network members will have the option to bring others into the study visit with them, (5) what information about the study will be shared.</description>

    <description>Contextually adapted and theory-driven messages - misinformation correction and self-affirmation - to increase awareness, self-efficacy and community engagement in our adapted Social Network testing Strategy (SNS). SNS is an evidence-based testing intervention that has been widely used in multiple settings with marginalized individuals (ie substance-users) who facilitate the recruitment of their social contacts into testing services.</description>
