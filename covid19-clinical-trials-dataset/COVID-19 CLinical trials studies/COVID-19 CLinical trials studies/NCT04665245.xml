    <textblock>
      In this study, COVID-19 positive patients will be added to a bidirectional texting program to&#xD;
      receive daily surveys about their symptoms with the infection. This data will further the&#xD;
      understanding of COVID-19 symptom development throughout the infection period, as well as how&#xD;
      those symptoms vary at different points of the day. This study will be a single cohort,&#xD;
      observational study of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One important approach for decreasing COVID-19 transmission in healthcare settings is to&#xD;
      prevent healthcare professionals from working while ill. Currently, facilities are asking&#xD;
      screening questions and measuring temperatures to help identify symptomatic healthcare&#xD;
      professionals and exclude them from providing patient care. Simulations can be used to inform&#xD;
      the effectiveness of different screening approaches, but the results of these simulations&#xD;
      depend upon the effectiveness of the intervention, e.g., the ability to identify healthcare&#xD;
      professionals on their way to work, or to study the impact of healthcare professionals&#xD;
      returning to work too early. Thus, simulations must necessarily depend upon realistic disease&#xD;
      parameters: for example, it is suspected that a non-trivial proportion of patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, but the relative size of the&#xD;
      asymptomatic subpopulation is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan for this study is to develop a method for granular measurement of twice-daily&#xD;
      symptoms from healthcare professionals and other research subjects of similar ages. After&#xD;
      being diagnosed, the goal is to determine what symptoms participants have and how long they&#xD;
      have had them. This will be done using a previously-developed bidirectional texting platform&#xD;
      to query participants about symptoms at least twice a day for ten days post diagnosis.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about subjective symptoms, including fevers, chills, cough,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, etc. They will also take their&#xD;
      temperature twice daily during the recovery period, which will help determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of screening based on symptoms and/or thermometer readings.&#xD;

        The study population will include patients at the University of Iowa Hospitals &amp; Clinics&#xD;
        (UIHC). Approximately 5,000 people have already tested positive for COVID-19 in Johnson&#xD;
        County alone, and numbers are continuing to increase. The University of Iowa Hospitals &amp;&#xD;
        Clinics see many patients from outside of Johnson County as well.&#xD;
