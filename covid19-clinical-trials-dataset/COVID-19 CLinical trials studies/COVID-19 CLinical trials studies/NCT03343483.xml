  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults who feel lonely carry increased risk for reduced quality of life, morbidity, and&#xD;
      mortality. Volunteering is a promising intervention for reducing loneliness in later life.&#xD;
      The primary objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a social volunteering&#xD;
      program for lonely older adults will lead to reduced loneliness and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares the effect of a Senior Corps volunteering intervention versus a&#xD;
      self-guided life review active control condition on feelings of loneliness in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves randomly assigning older adults (150 women, 150 men) who report loneliness&#xD;
      to 12 months of either: 1) a structured social volunteering program, or 2) an active control&#xD;
      intervention with self-guided life review. Specific aims are as follows: 1) To examine the&#xD;
      effect of volunteering on loneliness and quality of life; 2) To examine social engagement,&#xD;
      perceived usefulness, and social support as mechanisms for reducing loneliness; 3) To examine&#xD;
      conditions under which volunteering is most effective at reducing loneliness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The many negative outcomes associated with loneliness in older people have rendered&#xD;
      loneliness itself a new public health target. Older adults who feel lonely carry increased&#xD;
      risk for reduced quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The risk of premature mortality&#xD;
      related to loneliness is at least as large as the risks arising from such factors as obesity,&#xD;
      physical inactivity, alcohol misuse, and smoking. Volunteering is a promising intervention&#xD;
      for reducing loneliness in later life. The primary objective of this proposal is to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a social volunteering program for lonely older adults will lead to reduced&#xD;
      loneliness and improved quality of life. National infrastructure for volunteering (The Senior&#xD;
      Corps) ensures that volunteering is a highly scalable intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to compare the effect of a Senior Corps volunteering intervention&#xD;
      versus a self-guided life review active control condition on feelings of loneliness in older&#xD;
      adults. The investigators' preliminary data, as well as published studies of volunteering in&#xD;
      later life, strongly suggest that volunteering should reduce loneliness. Rigorous&#xD;
      experimental study is needed, however, to examine volunteering in both men and women who are&#xD;
      lonely, to determine conditions that maximize benefit, and to understand mechanisms. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize, per tenets of Self-Determination Theory, that increased social&#xD;
      engagement and feelings of both usefulness and social support function as psychological&#xD;
      mechanisms whereby volunteering reduces loneliness. Understanding these mechanisms will&#xD;
      promote effective implementation, allowing communities to adapt volunteering programs while&#xD;
      retaining the active ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves randomly assigning older adults (150 women, 150 men) who report loneliness&#xD;
      to 12 months of either: 1) a structured social volunteering program, or 2) an active control&#xD;
      intervention with self-guided life review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are as follows: 1) To examine the effect of volunteering on loneliness and&#xD;
      quality of life; 2) To examine social engagement, perceived usefulness, and social support as&#xD;
      mechanisms for reducing loneliness; 3) To examine conditions under which volunteering is most&#xD;
      effective at reducing loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteering intervention is already implemented nation-wide, indicating high feasibility&#xD;
      of going to scale (http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corps). If effective,&#xD;
      volunteering should be &quot;prescribed&quot; by physicians and promoted by policy. Dissemination and&#xD;
      scaling up efforts will involve connecting primary care patients and aging services clients&#xD;
      who are lonely with The Senior Corps, shown to be feasible in the investigators' companion&#xD;
      study, The Senior Connection. Existing infrastructure will make it possible to reach a large&#xD;
      proportion of lonely older adults. Reducing loneliness has the potential to improve&#xD;
      well-being and save lives.&#xD;

    <measure>Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, which assesses self-reported loneliness. 20 items, rated as to how often the participant has felt a certain way in the prior month (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel alone?&quot;) -- &quot;never&quot; (1), &quot;rarely&quot; (2), &quot;sometimes&quot; (3), or &quot;often&quot; (4). Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. However, some individual items must be reverse-coded so that higher total scores reflect greater loneliness (i.e., 1=4, 2=3, 3=2, 4=1). These items (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel there are people you can turn to?&quot;) are items 1,5,6,9,10,15,16,19,20. Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing a worse outcome (i.e., greater loneliness).</description>

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life--Bref instrument (WHOQOL-Bref). This self-report instrument comprises 26 items. The WHOQOL-Bref produces scores for four domains (i.e., physical health, psychological functioning, social relationships, and environmental opportunities) and a total score reflecting overall health-related quality of life. Our primary outcome is the total score assessing overall quality of life. All items are rated on a 5-pt scale, with scores of 5 representing the best outcome. Some items are reversed scored (per the WHOQOL manual). Scores are transformed (per the WHOQOL manual) such that the range for the total score is 0-100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Belonging</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of belonging will be measured with the 9 items in the &quot;belonging&quot; subscale of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire. Each item is rated on a 3-pt scale: 'not at all true for me' (0), 'somewhat true for me' (1), or 'very true for me' (2). Some items are reverse scored so that higher scores represent better outcomes (i.e., greater belonging). Scores represent a sum of all items and can range from 0 - 18.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meaning and Purpose</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Meaning and Purpose short form has 4 items, rated from 1 ('not at all'), 2 ('a little bit'), 3 ('somewhat'), 4 ('quite a bit'), and 5 ('very much'). Total scores are transformed using a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of the reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. For the Meaning and Purpose form, the reference group was a general (not clinical) population. Greater scores indicate a better outcome (i.e., greater meaning and purpose).</description>

    <description>Volunteers provide non-medical caregiving for frail seniors-&quot;care receivers&quot;-to help them maintain their independence and improve their well-being. Friendly visiting is the primary service provided. Structured, intensive training is provided prior to placement. The target expectation is of interactions in person and/or by telephone for at least 16 hours per month. On-going training (&quot;booster sessions&quot;) as well as volunteer support groups, and educational activities are provided. Participants not interested in serving as peer companions are allowed other volunteer options as long as the activities are deemed 'social' by the volunteer coordinator and are options routinely provided as part of the AmeriCorps Senior RSVP Program. COVID update: due to physical distancing requirements, volunteer placements have transitioned to remote friendly calling/letter writing or activities that can be conducted with physical distancing, such as delivery for Meals on Wheels.</description>
