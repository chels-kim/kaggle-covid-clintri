    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study will be conducted using a large administrative database of U.S.&#xD;
      hospitals to understand the volume-outcome relationship among patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with critical illness and/or respiratory failure tend to display better outcomes at&#xD;
      hospitals that manage higher volumes of these patients. However, during a COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      this relationship may have been altered by the strain of higher patient volume on resources&#xD;
      and personnel. A retrospective cohort study will be conducted using a large administrative&#xD;
      database to understand the volume-outcome relationship among patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      COVID-19. Understanding the COVID-19 volume-outcome relationship in U.S. hospitals may help&#xD;
      identify the optimal care setting and transfer thresholds, and inform triage policies and&#xD;
      risk-adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Premier Healthcare Database (PHD), an all-payer administrative data repository covering&#xD;
      approximately 20% of U.S. hospitalizations from 48 states will be queried for adult (18+&#xD;
      years) in-patient encounters that recorded diagnosis coding for COVID-19 March 1st through&#xD;
      August 31st, 2020 at continuously-reporting hospitals. Hospitals with &lt;15 COVID-19 encounters&#xD;
      over the study period will be excluded from the primary cohort to preserve statistical&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surge index will be calculated for each hospital month that incorporates&#xD;
      care-complexity-weighted COVID-19 case burden and will be normalized for nominal (2019) bed&#xD;
      capacity and non-COVID-19 case burden and will represent the primary covariate. Hospital&#xD;
      months will be stratified by the percentile of the surge index (e.g. &lt;50th, 50-75th, 75-90th,&#xD;
      90-95th and â‰¥95th percentile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of COVID-19-case burden (surge index) on the risk-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of&#xD;
      mortality (or discharge to hospice) among overall COVID-19 cohorts will be determined using a&#xD;
      hierarchical generalized linear mixed model controlling for case-mix, treatment-related,&#xD;
      time-varying and other hospital-level factors. Variables will be selected based on their&#xD;
      representing &quot;baseline&quot; status upon presentation to the hospital to minimize effect of&#xD;
      mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables for case mix adjustment: age, gender, race/ethnicity, comorbidity burden, insurance&#xD;
      status, admission source and acuity, acute organ failure score and code status&#xD;
      present-on-admission, use of pharmacologic agents (Remdesivir, corticosteroids,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin), severity of hypoxia (acute respiratory failure codes,&#xD;
      need for non invasive positive pressure ventilation, need for invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation), vasopressor use within two days of admission respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables for temporal and hospital-level adjustment: hospital teaching status, urbanicity,&#xD;
      geographic region, bed capacity, hospital proportion of Medicaid/uninsured admissions,&#xD;
      proportion of COVID-19 patients intubated within 2 days of admission, hospital's technologic&#xD;
      index (stratified by availability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, more than one ICU&#xD;
      and continuous renal replacement therapy), hospital availability of Remdesivir, attending&#xD;
      physician to patient ratio, pre-COVID-19 mechanical ventilation volume, proportion of overall&#xD;
      admits tested for COVID-19 and admission month (1st vs 2nd wave).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect modification by (1st vs. 2nd ) pandemic wave, the previous month's surge index and&#xD;
      rate of acute hospital transfers and/or tracheotomies will assessed using interaction terms.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses will be performed using alternative iterations/strata of the surge&#xD;
      index, excluding fewer patients for statistical reliability, models with and without&#xD;
      treatment-related variables and using Elixhauser comorbidity index instead of US Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention-defined poor prognostic underlying conditions in COVID-19 to&#xD;
      test robustness of results. Analyses will be repeated using in-hospital mortality (without&#xD;
      reported discharges to hospice). The magnitude of an unmeasured confounder that would be&#xD;
      necessary to alter the direction of statistically significant findings will be assessed. More&#xD;
      selective subgroups of patients in ICU and mechanical ventilation will not be used as a&#xD;
      primary study population given the potentially dynamic nature of admission and intubation&#xD;
      criteria over the course of the pandemic and its relationship to volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on availability at the time of analysis, an de-identified curated electronic health&#xD;
      record-based dataset will be used for clinical validation of select variables in&#xD;
      administrative data (e.g. reliability of respiratory failure codes in representing patients&#xD;
      requiring high-flow oxygen alone i.e. not non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation.)&#xD;
