  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of January 2020, the international community was informed of the presence of a new&#xD;
      viral disease that started in Wuhan (China) and spread rapidly throughout the world. The&#xD;
      identified virus belonged to the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease was named&#xD;
      COVID-19. Today there are more than 2 million people diagnosed in Spain and more than 40&#xD;
      thousand in Extremadura. The partial knowledge about the development, evolution of the&#xD;
      affected citizenship and their prognosis both early and late makes it necessary to analyze in&#xD;
      depth their global and particular characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out a multicenter, observational, descriptive, cross-sectional and longitudinal&#xD;
      study of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the Community of Extremadura&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of drug treatments and the clinical and evolutionary&#xD;
      characteristics of these patients and the different factors that may influence its evolution.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological, socio-sanitary, clinical, analytical and radiological data will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively and prospectively from all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without hospital&#xD;
      admission in our community from the start of the pandemic and for one year from the start of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be obtained mainly from the clinical history and collected in the data&#xD;
      collection notebooks and electronic base designed for the study for subsequent analysis. The&#xD;
      data collection period will be one year, estimating a sample of 5,000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients included in the study prospectively will be asked for consent to&#xD;
      collect a blood sample for freezing and storage in the Biobank of Extremadura and subsequent&#xD;
      use to determine biomarkers and genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be carried out in accordance with the observational National&#xD;
      Post-Authorization Study (EPA) for medicines for human use proposed by Valdecilla Health&#xD;
      Research Institute (IDIVAL), the main objective of which is to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the pharmacological treatments currently used in COVID-19.&#xD;

    <measure>To assess the health-related quality of life perceived by hospitalized patients after recovery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the quality of life related to health the investigators will use the Short Form-12 Health Survey after recovery. This questionnaire assesses the degree of well-being and functional capacity and it is composed of twelve items and eight dimensions (physical function, physical role, body pain, mental health, general health, vitality, social function and emotional role), defining a positive or negative state of the physical and mental health. Some included items are: &quot;In general, would you say that your health is&quot;, &quot;During the last 4 weeks, to what extent has your physical health or emotional problems hindered your usual social activities with family, friends, neighbors or other people? &quot;,&quot; Did you have pain in any part of your body during the last 4 weeks? &quot;. The response options form Likert-type scales where the number of options varies from three to six points. The score ranges from 0 to 100. A higher score implies a better health-related quality of life.</description>
