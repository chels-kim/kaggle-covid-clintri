  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly resulted in an increased level of personal anxiety,&#xD;
      reduced access to support services, and as a secondary complication, increased physical&#xD;
      inactivity. Older people appear to be at higher risk of several secondary complications and&#xD;
      long-term negative health outcomes. These complications include declines in physical health&#xD;
      and mobility, social isolation, and worsening mental health. There is strong evidence in&#xD;
      older persons that supports the role of exercise and physical activity in: the alleviation of&#xD;
      strength and mobility declines, reducing anxiety and depression, and alleviating cognitive&#xD;
      declines. Exercise-based intervention trials have also been shown to reduce social isolation&#xD;
      and loneliness. This study will compare an online exercise program delivered via Zoom and a&#xD;
      waitlist control group in healthy older persons.&#xD;

      This study will examine the impacts of an online exercise program in healthy older persons&#xD;
      compared to a waitlist control group. Briefly, participants (healthy persons, age 65-80 years&#xD;
      old) will participate in an online group exercise program (designed to meet Canada's Physical&#xD;
      Activity Guidelines) via Zoom delivered by Registered Kinesiologists and Physiotherapists for&#xD;
      a total of 8 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to the exercise group or the&#xD;
      waitlist control group. Participants' will undergo assessments of physical activity,&#xD;
      life-space mobility, nutrition, loneliness, depression, and anxiety at baseline, end of&#xD;
      study, and 8-weeks following the end of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) contains 20 items that measure the intensity of anxious symptoms on a dichotomous scale (agree or disagree). The total score ranges from 0 to 20. A score of 10 or over is associated with the presence of a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).</description>
