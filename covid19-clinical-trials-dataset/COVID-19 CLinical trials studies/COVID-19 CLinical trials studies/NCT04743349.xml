  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is an RNA virus coated with a capsid and a&#xD;
      peri-capsid crossed by glycoprotein structures. The external proteic structure, which attacks&#xD;
      human cells, is a potential target to therapeutic interventions against virus replication in&#xD;
      airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since high temperature can cause irreversible denaturation of proteins and loss of SARS CoV&#xD;
      and SARS CoV-2 infectivity was obtained after heating at 56 ◦C for 15 and 30 min in liquid&#xD;
      environments respectively, we designed a protocol aimed at damaging SARS-CoV-2 capsid through&#xD;
      steam inhalation cycles. Although the ominous consequences of COVID 19 infections has&#xD;
      directed medical attention toward solidly established medical approaches, the European&#xD;
      Pharmacopoeia VI edition also quotes steam inhalations as a procedure to treat of respiratory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these suggestions we established a quasi-randomized clinical trial enrolling 200&#xD;
      asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients in whom rhino-pharyngeal-swab revealed a SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. The study protocol consisted of exposure of airway mucosae to humidified steam (pH&#xD;
      8 per NaHCO3 and hypertonic 15 g/L NaCl) through steam inhalation for at least 20 min (4&#xD;
      cycles of 5 min) daily, for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to reduce the viral shedding using steam inhalations.&#xD;
