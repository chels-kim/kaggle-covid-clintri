    <textblock>
      It is an established fact that, corona virus spread through the respiratory droplets.&#xD;
      Colonization of the virus in oropharynx and/or nasopharynx is considered to be major factor&#xD;
      for transmissibility of the virus through respiratory secretions. Preventing colonization of&#xD;
      the virus by administrating povidone iodine in the nasal passage therefore, a rational&#xD;
      thought which is supported by recent evidence of in-vitro virucidal action of povidone iodine&#xD;
      in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). Therefore, the study is&#xD;
      designed to assess the virucidal effect of povidone iodine on COVID-19 virus in-vivo.This&#xD;
      open label randomized clinical trial will be conducted at Department of Otorhinolaryngology&#xD;
      and Head Neck Surgery, in collaboration with Department of Virology and Department of&#xD;
      Medicine in Dhaka Medical College (DMC) Hospital. The study will be conducted from September&#xD;
      2020 to October 2020. Total 175 confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease, proven by Reverse&#xD;
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be ensured before participation. In case of no literacy, finger&#xD;
      print will be considered for written permission.Consent will be sought from the legal&#xD;
      guardian in case of minor or underaged.Formal ethical clearance will be taken from Ethical&#xD;
      Review Committee (ERC) of Dhaka Medical College. All of the Participants will be divided into&#xD;
      seven groups: Group A will receive Povidone iodine (PVP-I) nasal irrigation at concentration&#xD;
      of 0.4%, Group B and Group C will received 0.5% and 0.6%; Group D will receive PVP-I nasal&#xD;
      spray at concentration of 0.5% and Group E will received at 0.6% concentration. Group F&#xD;
      (Placebo comparator group) will receive nasal irrigation by distilled water (DW) and Group G&#xD;
      (Placebo comparator group) will received nasal spray by distilled water. The contact time&#xD;
      will be minimum 30 seconds. After the individual application of PVP-I and distilled water in&#xD;
      respective participant, they will be tested again for RT-PCR for COVID-19 from nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      and oropharyngeal sample. All patients will be subjected to detail history, physical&#xD;
      examination and adverse events. Block Randomization will be followed for randomization. Data&#xD;
      will be recorded in a semi-structured questionnaire and will be analyzed by 'R-4.0.2' data&#xD;
      analysis software&#xD;

      Rationale of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease and cause human to&#xD;
      human transmission primarily by respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing and speaking. In&#xD;
      early SARS-CoV-2 infection, a greater viral titre can be found in saliva and nasal mucous;&#xD;
      minimization of these titres should help to reduce cross infection. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I)&#xD;
      disinfectant has better anti-viral activity than other antiseptics and has already been&#xD;
      proven to be an extremely effective virucide in vitro against severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Its' in&#xD;
      vivo virucidal activity is unknown, though its nasal or oral preparation can be effective in&#xD;
      reducing transmission. Earlier, a very few studies have evaluated the efficacy of&#xD;
      povidone-iodine as nasal antiseptics or oral rinse antiseptics against the SARS-CoV-2 virus&#xD;
      but the result of those studies are not undebatable. So aim of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the virucidal activity of povidone iodine on coronavirus located on the mucosal surface of&#xD;
      oropharynx and nasopharynx and is very rational in this pandemic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the virucidal efficacy of povidone iodine on COVID-19 virus located in&#xD;
      nasopharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To determine the efficacy of povidone iodine to clear COVID-19 virus located in&#xD;
      nasopharynx ii. To assess the adverse events among the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Open label randomized clinical trial. Place of Study: Department of&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology and Head Neck Surgery, in collaboration with Department of Virology and&#xD;
      Department of Medicine, Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period of study: The study period will be September 2020 to November 2020. Study population:&#xD;
      Confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease proven by RT-PCR testing. Sampling and Statistical basis&#xD;
      of the sample size: The sample size is determined using the following formula Sample size:&#xD;
      estimated sample size 189 (twenty seven in each group) Research instruments General&#xD;
      questionnaire for recording baseline information A checklist for for detecting COVID-19&#xD;
      status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant selection and enrollment: All patients admitted to the medical wards through&#xD;
      emergency department or Outpatient department with suspected COVID-19 cases will be initially&#xD;
      approached and screened for confirmation of the COVID-19. Confirmation of the COVID-19 will&#xD;
      be done by positive impression of RT-PCR result. Following confirmation of the viral&#xD;
      infection, the patients will be seen by the ward doctors and clinical trial physicians&#xD;
      (registered physicians). Moreover, baseline complete blood count (CBC) will be done for each&#xD;
      patient. Chest X-ray/High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) will be done in necessary&#xD;
      case. The ward doctors and trial physicians will together care for the patient; then the&#xD;
      patients will be briefed about the aim, objective and details of the procedure of the study.&#xD;
      If without capacity, their relatives will be approached about the trial and seek their&#xD;
      consent for recruitment. As this study will be confined into a tertiary care hospital,&#xD;
      patients will be recruited up to day 4 of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting participants: It will be prioritized that the patients will be treated early for&#xD;
      COVID-19 management by standard regiment and in accordance to the guidance of the national&#xD;
      guidelines. And within shortest possible time preferably within 4 hours of admission,&#xD;
      consenting procedure will be completed either from the patient or from the attendant/legal&#xD;
      guardian of the patients to obtain the full potential benefit of the treatment. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the patient in their own language [Bengali] by trial&#xD;
      physicians working on the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for eligibility: During admission, demographic and clinical details including name,&#xD;
      age/date of birth, gender, duration of onset of fever and hospitalization, vital statistics&#xD;
      will be recorded before randomization. RT PCR for COVID-19 will be used for confirmation of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 virus infection. A screening log will be maintained including these essential&#xD;
      details and the decision taken by the patient or attendant or legal guardian where&#xD;
      appropriate concerning recruitment. Ineligible and non-recruited patients will also be cared&#xD;
      by the ward physicians following standard treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure of randomization: The study participants will be randomly assigned in this study&#xD;
      into six equal groups; where each group has equal opportunity to receive any treatment&#xD;
      option. Randomization will be done by block randomization methods. Randomization will be done&#xD;
      quickly, with baseline information typically captured in &lt;15 min. Recruitment &amp; randomization&#xD;
      will be performed contemporaneously with assessment/resuscitation of patients by a second&#xD;
      person so that medical care is not delayed by recruitment. Patients will only be randomized&#xD;
      once baseline data has been entered; after this has been done, participants will not be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. Following completion of the randomization, the trial physicians&#xD;
      reported the Principal Investigator (PI) of the trial and then the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (PI) handed over an opaque sealed envelope, which will be numbered sequentially to correspond&#xD;
      to patient enrollment numbers, which will be used for concealment of treatment allocations.&#xD;
      Envelopes will be kept in a locked drawer and will be opened in strictly numerical order by&#xD;
      in supervisor in presence of nursing supervisor of study unit. Allocation between arms will&#xD;
      initially be equal, although this may be revised following guidance of the PI and his team&#xD;
      (as per the statistical plan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of study participants: Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      point, for any reason. If this occurs, the primary reason for withdrawal will be documented&#xD;
      in the participant's case record form. The participant will have the option of withdrawal&#xD;
      from:&#xD;
&#xD;
      participant samples. Randomized patients who wish to withdraw from the study before they have&#xD;
      undertaken any study-related procedures will be replaced. Data on the original participant&#xD;
      will be kept on the CRF/database if the participant agrees to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational medicinal products:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the Participants will be divided into three groups: Group A will receive Povidone&#xD;
      iodine (PVP-I) nasal irrigation (NI) at three different concentration of 0.4%, Group B and&#xD;
      Group C will received 0.5% and 0.6%; Group D will receive PVP-I nasal spray (NS) at&#xD;
      concentration of 0.5% and Group E will received at 0.6% concentration. Group F (Placebo&#xD;
      comparator group) will receive nasal irrigation by distilled water and Group G (Placebo&#xD;
      comparator group) will received nasal spray by distilled water Participant compliance: The&#xD;
      study team will not create any problem with compliance while the patient is under care and&#xD;
      supervision in hospital. It was ensured that all recruited patients receive the appropriate&#xD;
      interventions, although it could be interrupted due to the onset of potential adverse effects&#xD;
      such as hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsibility sharing of care of the patients: As the patients will remain under the care of&#xD;
      the hospitals' consultant physicians/unit head who will have primary responsibility for their&#xD;
      management. Management protocols will be agreed between the medical team and study team.&#xD;
      Decisions about intubation, requirement of blood and blood products, transfer of patients to&#xD;
      intensive care, weaning of ventilation and extubation will be made by the medical team&#xD;
      independently of study doctors. All decisions will be based on the patient's clinical&#xD;
      condition and the available hospital resources, as per usual hospital practice. The study&#xD;
      team preferably by trial physicians will note down the record in patient's Case Record Form&#xD;
      (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of data collection: data collection will be done by the trial physicians. A paper&#xD;
      based semi-structured questionnaire was made and pre-tested before data collection. All&#xD;
      potential participants will be recorded in this database at first contact and assigned a&#xD;
      study number. This study number (eg DMC-PVP-I-0001) will be used for all data and samples&#xD;
      collected from that person. Study doctors will recruit and randomize patients at the bedside&#xD;
      with a randomization procedure. They will not be able to predict allocation before&#xD;
      randomization. Following randomization, allocation will be done by the PI and trial&#xD;
      physicians or nurse will confirm the administration of the either drug/distilled water.&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored. Temperature will be measured in every 6 hours, blood&#xD;
      pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate will be measured in every hour. Urine output will be&#xD;
      measured in every 8 hours. Drug related side effects or any adverse events will be observed&#xD;
      in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no reaction or unusual event, another RT-PCR sample will be collected from the&#xD;
      nasopharynx and sent for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the follow up will be for 2 days (or person fulfills the discharge&#xD;
      criteria). All clinical events will be noted in case record form by trial physicians,&#xD;
      including vital status at hospital discharge. Data entry will be date/time stamped.&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis data will be collected using same CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality and standards: following collection, all data set and collected record form will&#xD;
      be checked. A formal clinical data management plan will be written before the study starts,&#xD;
      agreed by the co-investigators, and Data Monitoring Committee, and documented trail master&#xD;
      file. Laboratory results will be discussed regularly between the PI and laboratory managers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Analysis Plan of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done by data management software, R-4.0.2'. Statistical significance is&#xD;
      set as 95% confidence level at 5% acceptable error level. Differences will be considered&#xD;
      significant at the P &lt; 0.05 level for all these tests. The data will be expressed as means&#xD;
      ±Standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and as frequencies (%) for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Chi-square test, student t test or ANOVA or other statistical test will be used in&#xD;
      case of normally distributed data and similar non-parametric data will be used whenever&#xD;
      appropriate. Graph &amp; chart will be expressed by Microsoft Excel 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher is duly concern about the ethical issues relate to the study. In this study&#xD;
      the following criteria will be followed to ensure maintaining the ethical values. All ethical&#xD;
      measure will be followed in accordance to the current Declaration of the Helsinki and Good&#xD;
      clinical practice (GCP) and Good laboratory practice (GLP) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities available at study center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RT-PCR and other study-related testing will be done at DMCH. DMCH was designated as a&#xD;
      COVID dedicated hospital which provide multidisciplinary care.Necessary investigations are&#xD;
      available here with minimal cost.&#xD;
