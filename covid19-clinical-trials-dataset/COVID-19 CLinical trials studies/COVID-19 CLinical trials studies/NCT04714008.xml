  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a major threat to global health.&#xD;
      Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, all eyes have been focused on the significant&#xD;
      somatic complications of COVID-19, but the impact on behaviors, particularly those that can&#xD;
      lead to addictive disorders, remains little studied. A set of factors could explain a change&#xD;
      in gambling activities, both in number of gamblers and in intensity of practices, due to the&#xD;
      pandemic. On the one hand, the reduction or even the interruption of sporting and horse&#xD;
      racing competitions may induce a decrease in these activities (both online and offline).&#xD;
      Moreover, the closure of certain gambling venues and travel restrictions may also lead to a&#xD;
      decrease of offline gambling activities in general. On the other hand, gamblers who can no&#xD;
      longer perform their usual gambling activity could refer to available online gambling&#xD;
      activities (poker, lotteries, casinos, etc.). Moreover, the threat of a financial crisis, the&#xD;
      negative impact on psychological well-being (due to social isolation, stress of being&#xD;
      infected, etc.), and increased time spent freely online, could also very largely motivate an&#xD;
      initiation or an exacerbation of the gambling activity, especially online and in people in a&#xD;
      situation of vulnerability. Both in France and Sweden, the closing of sports and horse race&#xD;
      events has led to a sharp decrease in sports and horse-race betting. In both countries, the&#xD;
      increase in other gambling types, including illegal gambling, and their potential for&#xD;
      gambling problems is a source of concerns for public health authorities. As a consequence,&#xD;
      more research is promptly needed in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of gambling tracking data, widely acclaimed in recent years in research on online&#xD;
      gambling given its ecological nature, could allow observing longitudinally changes in online&#xD;
      gambling practices (both the raw gambling activity and risky behaviors) and in the use of&#xD;
      responsible gambling (RG) tools due to the pandemic. Moreover, the combination of French and&#xD;
      Swedish data will allow comparing two countries with very distinct politics regarding the&#xD;
      pandemics, i.e. a lockdown in France in March - May 2020 and then in November - December 2020&#xD;
      compared to no lockdown in Sweden. Finally, gambling in women is on the rise and women&#xD;
      display specific gambling behaviors, especially in early stages of the online gambling&#xD;
      practice. The project will include the investigation of gender specificities both in the&#xD;
      investigation of the impacts of the pandemic and in the comparison of French and Sweden&#xD;
      gambling behaviors. Age, type of gambling activity and country (France / Sweden) will also be&#xD;
      taken into account.&#xD;

    <description>Because &quot;gambling activity&quot; is not directly measured as such, but rather observed as a combination of gambling indicators (e.g. money spent, type of game, numbers of gambling days, etc.), these indicators will be included as observed variables, explained by a latent (unobserved) variable, namely &quot;gambling activity&quot;. Subgroups of gamblers with distinct impacts of the COVID-19 on their gambling activities will be identified.</description>
