  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide optimal care to patients and to maintain long-term institutional viability,&#xD;
      Transplant Centres (TC) must have an awareness of their patients' health status, their health&#xD;
      care needs and priorities, as well as their access to information and health care. For&#xD;
      example, it is critical that TCs understand whether their patients are medically suitable for&#xD;
      transplant, whether transplantation remains a priority for their patients, how best to&#xD;
      communicate with their patients, and whether their patients have sufficient access to&#xD;
      medications and health care to undergo transplant safely. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a&#xD;
      tremendous impact on people and institutions around the country in a short period of time. At&#xD;
      this time, little is known regarding its impact on the transplant community specifically. For&#xD;
      example, it has been reported that around 8 million French applied for partial unemployment&#xD;
      benefit over the past month, but it is not known if this has affected transplant patients. It&#xD;
      has been reported that people with significant chronic medical conditions and those with&#xD;
      compromised immune systems may be at increased risk of dying from the COVID-19, but it is not&#xD;
      known if this has affected patients' interest in receiving transplants at this time. The&#xD;
      &quot;Société Francophone de Transplantation (SFT)&quot; published recommendations at the beginning of&#xD;
      the pandemic in order to limit the rate of infection in these high-risk population. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients on the&#xD;
      waiting list and transplant patients. Further, a better understand on how patients have&#xD;
      received information about this pandemic and how best to communicate with them.&#xD;

      Transplant Centres (TCs) serve a unique patient population, those with end-organ disease who&#xD;
      are either waiting for, or who have received, a solid-organ transplant. For transplant&#xD;
      candidates, TCs help weigh the threat of their current condition against the intended&#xD;
      benefits and associated risks of transplantation, which include major-surgery and chronic&#xD;
      immune suppression (IS). For transplant recipients, TCs help manage the life-long risks&#xD;
      associated with IS, including infection and malignancy, and facilitate access to appropriate&#xD;
      health care over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide optimal care to patients and to maintain long-term institutional viability, TCs&#xD;
      must have an awareness of their patients' health status, their health care needs and&#xD;
      priorities, as well as their access to information and health care. For example, it is&#xD;
      critical that TCs understand whether their patients are medically suitable for transplant,&#xD;
      whether transplantation remains a priority for their patients, how best to communicate with&#xD;
      their patients, and whether their patients have sufficient access to medications and health&#xD;
      care to undergo transplant safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people and institutions around the&#xD;
      country in a short period of time. At this time, little is known regarding its impact on the&#xD;
      transplant community specifically. For example, it has been reported that around 8 million&#xD;
      French applied for partial unemployment benefit over the past month, but it is not known if&#xD;
      this has affected transplant patients. It has been reported that people with significant&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems may be at increased risk&#xD;
      of dying from the COVID-19, but it is not known if this has affected patients' interest in&#xD;
      receiving transplants at this time. The &quot;Société Francophone de Transplantation (SFT)&quot;&#xD;
      published recommendations at the beginning of the pandemic in order to limit the rate of&#xD;
      infection in these high-risk population. Briefly, these recommendations encompassed the&#xD;
      following points: Not stopping immunosuppression, strict application of the social&#xD;
      distancing, recommendation to stay and work at home, recommendation to limit the visits at&#xD;
      the hospital. However, it is still unclear whether these recommendations were followed by the&#xD;
      transplant recipients, and if this exceptional situation has affected their access to health&#xD;
      care or needed medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients on the&#xD;
      waiting list and transplant patients. Further, a better understand on how patients are&#xD;
      receiving information about this pandemic and how best to communicate with them. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that peri-transplant patient groups may appropriately perceive themselves to be&#xD;
      at high risk of infection and poor outcomes, and that this may influence their decisions&#xD;
      around seeking medical care and willingness to undergo organ transplantation. Additionally,&#xD;
      the investigator anticipate a wide range of needs and risks among patients, including their&#xD;
      ability to isolate from potential infection, ability to access medications and medical care,&#xD;
      and their ability to access information regarding COVID-19. Ultimately, the investigator plan&#xD;
      to use the information collected from patients to improve patient education regarding&#xD;
      COVID-19 and to inform centres' response to future epidemics and/or natural disasters that&#xD;
      disrupt patient care. Until now, no systematic description of transplant patients' needs,&#xD;
      priorities, behavior's, attitudes, or education has been done during this pandemic.&#xD;
