  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic-like disease caused by a new coronavirus called Severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) isolated in China in 2019. Clinical&#xD;
      manifestations vary widely from one individual to another, from asymptomatic carrier to a&#xD;
      febrile cough that can rapidly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the&#xD;
      beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, screening by chest X-ray (RT) and polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 conducted by the Cornwall Hospital Union laboratory has shown that&#xD;
      among symptomatic patients and hospital staff suspected of being COVID-19, only 7.8% were&#xD;
      attributable to COVID-19. Two nosocomial clusters were also identified, in the emergency&#xD;
      department (10 carers) and in the cardiology department (6 carers and one patient). However,&#xD;
      direct diagnosis by RT-PCR has sensitivity limits and can lead to false negative results when&#xD;
      the subject is indeed suffering from COVID-19. This lack of sensitivity is inherent to the&#xD;
      technique on the one hand, but also to the quality of the sample and the kinetics of the&#xD;
      infection. Indeed, the virological window during which the virus is present in the&#xD;
      respiratory mucous membranes sampled seems relatively narrow, hence a progressive&#xD;
      negativation of the respiratory samples as the disease progresses. Moreover, clinical&#xD;
      symptoms vary from one individual to another, and it is now recognized that some infected&#xD;
      persons are asymptomatic but carry the virus. Thus, the use of a second diagnostic technique&#xD;
      is a necessity, and serology could be a relevant diagnostic support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, several publications report the performance of COVID-19 serology in&#xD;
      clusters of cases or cohorts of subjects. The serological techniques employed are variable&#xD;
      (target epitopes in particular) and frequently homemade. Serology is mainly studied in&#xD;
      comparison or association with RT-PCR in order to highlight the increased performance of&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis when the two techniques are combined. Correlation with chest CT imaging&#xD;
      data is also encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous serological tests are therefore being tested to determine retrospectively whether&#xD;
      the individual has been exposed to the virus by looking for specific antibodies to the virus.&#xD;
      The supreme health authority has drawn up specifications dated 16 April 2020, defining the&#xD;
      methods for evaluating the performance of serological tests detecting antibodies directed&#xD;
      against SARSCoV-2 in order to provide a framework for these practices. Several clinical&#xD;
      studies are also underway, in particular to assess the kinetics of the appearance of the&#xD;
      antibodies, whether these specific antibodies would be protective and whether their&#xD;
      appearance would coincide with a cessation of contagiousness. Thus, the main objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the COVID-19 immunoglobulin (IgG)&#xD;
      Dia-Pro serological test, in view of its deployment at the Cornish Hospital Union Laboratory.&#xD;
      Subsequently, given the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Brittany and the risk of a second&#xD;
      epidemic wave when the confinement is lifted, the evaluation of the seroprevalence of the&#xD;
      staff of the Cornish Hospital Union is necessary in order to assess the attack rate of&#xD;
      COVID-19 within the establishment and particularly within departments where nosocomial&#xD;
      clusters have been reported; and to prevent the impact of deconfinement. Indeed, knowledge of&#xD;
      the proportion of immunized personnel and its distribution according to services will make it&#xD;
      possible to establish internal recommendations and to effectively manage personal protective&#xD;
      equipment inventories, in conjunction with the deconfinement strategy that will be&#xD;
      implemented by the government. The goal is to protect hospital staff from overexposure to the&#xD;
      virus;&#xD;
