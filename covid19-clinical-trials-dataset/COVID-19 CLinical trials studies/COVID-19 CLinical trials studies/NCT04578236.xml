      Efficacy of Aerosol Combination Therapy of 13 Cis Retinoic Acid and Captopril for Treating&#xD;
      Covid-19 Patients Via Indirect Inhibition of Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has infected over 20,000,000&#xD;
      people causing over 700,000 deaths. It has no currently approved treatments.Airborne&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans initiate from the virus entering nasal and airway epithelial&#xD;
      cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Transmembrane protease,&#xD;
      serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cellular protease that activates the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,&#xD;
      colocalizes with ACE2 and can prime SARS-CoV-2 fusion directly at the plasma membrane.&#xD;
      Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and&#xD;
      an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and&#xD;
      lung epithelial cell. TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several folds higher in the prostate&#xD;
      relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains&#xD;
      unknown. A study found that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) s a potent activator of TMPRSS2.On the&#xD;
      other hand, Feily et al noted that low-dose isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day for 15-20 weeks) in&#xD;
      PCO patients with moderate to severe nodulocystic acne resulted in significant decreases in&#xD;
      levels of serum total testosterone, prolactin, and dihydrotestosterone A study demonstrated&#xD;
      that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits dihydrotestosterone.&#xD;
      Therefore, we suggest that 13- cis -Retinoic acid will downregulate TMPRSS2 expression&#xD;
      thorough temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the activation of&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 gene expression. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly taken by heart patients to&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure and to treat heart failure.Earlier studies had cautioned that this&#xD;
      class of drugs could possibly increase the risk for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      infection and elevate COVID-19 severity. There is conflicting observational evidence about&#xD;
      the potential clinical impact of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on patients with COVID-19. Select&#xD;
      preclinical investigations have raised concerns about their safety in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
      On the other hand, Preliminary data hypothesise that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitors and renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors could benefit patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 by decreasing acute lung damage and preventing angiotensin-II-mediated&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammation. Here in our review, we use established and emerging evidence based on&#xD;
      the findings of previous studies and researches to propose that ACE inhibitors may benefit&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 via attenuating and abolishing the effect of androgenic hormones on&#xD;
      inducing the expression of Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), even though, at the&#xD;
      same time, ACE inhibitors cause an increase in the human cell surface receptor protein ACE2&#xD;
      which the novel coronavirus uses to enter and infect cells. A study on hypertensive rats&#xD;
      demonstrated that using ACE inhibitors(captopril) abolished and attenuated the effect of&#xD;
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In this study RAS inhibition exhibited beneficial effects on&#xD;
      androgen-induced obesity and abolished the androgen-mediated increase in blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      observed in this model of PCOS. (83 ± 1 vs 115 ± 3 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001). A another study found&#xD;
      that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril abolished testosterone effect and&#xD;
      attenuates testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats; a mechanistic approach.&#xD;
      Captopril is a potent inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme. These effects of&#xD;
      testosterone were almost prevented by captopril (100 mg/kg). In conclusion, generally&#xD;
      treatment with ACE inhibitors is associated with reduced androgen levels. Therefore,we think&#xD;
      that Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is an indirect target of ACE inhibitors and&#xD;
      13 cis retinoic acid As aresult, we hypothesize that any drug which downregulates TMPRSS2&#xD;
      expression through targeting AR, AR co-regulatory factors, or AR downstream transcription&#xD;
      factors might be potentially effective against COVID-19 and is worth investigating under a&#xD;
      clinical trial..&#xD;
