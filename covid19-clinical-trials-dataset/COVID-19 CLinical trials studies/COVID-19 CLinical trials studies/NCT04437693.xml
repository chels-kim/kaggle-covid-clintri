    <textblock>
      More cases of COVID-19 pandemic are being reported daily around the world. It is highly&#xD;
      infectious and, over 7 million people have been infected and more than 400,000 people have&#xD;
      died globally till this date. Countries around the world are struggling to avoid the spread&#xD;
      of this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that there are no approved drugs&#xD;
      for COVID-19 treatment. Researchers around the globe, however, are researching different&#xD;
      medications for COVID-19 patients, including the drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which is&#xD;
      mainly used for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Malaria. Not enough data was obtained yet to know&#xD;
      how well all of these medications are functioning. Therefore, aim to perform a randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to assess the impact of these medications on COVID -19 healthcare&#xD;
      workers exposed while treating COVID 19 patients in Qatar to avoid causality and&#xD;
      comorbidities in healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is considered as a weak base. Many viruses enter the host cells via endocytosis, as a&#xD;
      result of which they are initially taken up into an intracellular compartment that is&#xD;
      &quot;typically fairly acidic&quot; whereas; Hydroxychloroquine would alter the acidity of this&#xD;
      compartment, which can interfere with the ability of viruses to escape into the host cell and&#xD;
      start replicating. Another hypothesis on the rationale of the Antiviral activity of HCQ, is&#xD;
      that HCQ may also alter the ability of the virus to bind to the outside of a host cell in the&#xD;
      first place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interventional, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial that will include&#xD;
      participants who will be healthcare workers at risks of exposure to COVID-19 while managing&#xD;
      patients with confirmed infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will compare the safety, efficacy and effectiveness of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)&#xD;
      use of HCQ in healthcare workers at risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, in comparison to&#xD;
      Placebo in Qatar.&#xD;

      More cases of COVID-19 pandemic are being reported daily around the world. It is highly&#xD;
      infectious and, over 7 million people have been infected and more than 400,000 people have&#xD;
      died globally till this date. Countries around the world are struggling to avoid the spread&#xD;
      of this pandemic. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease are fever, fatigue, and dry&#xD;
      cough. Most people (approximately 80 percent) recover from the disease without special care.&#xD;
      The disease can be serious, and even fatal. Older people, and people with other medical&#xD;
      conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), maybe more vulnerable to becoming&#xD;
      severely ill. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities throughout the world,&#xD;
      the search for effective drugs remains a priority. Scientists across the globe are working to&#xD;
      produce a vaccine, but unlikely to be available before 2021. Meanwhile, a growing number of&#xD;
      countries have taken a series of systematic measures to curb coronavirus spread, including&#xD;
      national lockdowns, meeting bans, school closings, closures of restaurants, bars, sports&#xD;
      clubs etc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers used to evaluate the invitro effectiveness of several potential COVID-19&#xD;
      treatments, including chloroquine (CQ) and redmeveir (RDV). The findings were found&#xD;
      encouraging as 90 percent of the virus was inhibited by a low concentration of CQ and the&#xD;
      results for RDV were even better-with an even lower concentration of this drug, achieving a&#xD;
      virus inhibition of 90 percent. However, unless clinically verified, it cannot confirm these&#xD;
      drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. It is not known how well these medications&#xD;
      function in people who are infected with COVID-19 and is still being studied. The first&#xD;
      patient reported to be infected with COVID -19 in the U.S. was treated with RDV. The&#xD;
      treatment started on the 7th day of hospitalization and on the 11th day after his symptoms&#xD;
      were first identified. He started showing signs of progress on the very next day, presumably&#xD;
      due to treatment with RDV. Further data, however, is required to confirm the effect of this&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers in France have also been studying the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)&#xD;
      in a single-arm regimen to treat people with COVID-19. HCQ (and, in some cases, also&#xD;
      antibiotic azithromycin) has been used in this study to treat individuals with the COVID-19&#xD;
      virus in one setting. Investigators measured the amount of virus in swabs taken from these&#xD;
      individuals and from a group of individuals who did not receive HCQ. A larger decrease in the&#xD;
      volume of the virus from the individuals receiving HCQ occurred on a span of six days.&#xD;
      However, the groups were not randomized. Individuals who did not receive HCQ were at various&#xD;
      medical facilities and not necessarily like the individuals in the HCQ group. The results are&#xD;
      intriguing. But it's important to note that scientists have expressed concerns about this&#xD;
      study. Indeed, after the publication of these findings, a statement has been released in the&#xD;
      journal that it did not meet the &quot;expected standard&quot; of research (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, these two drugs HCQ and RDV were designed primarily to fight other diseases and not&#xD;
      COVID-19. Few data are available indicating that either could have some interest in the&#xD;
      treatment of the disease, but its complete effect on COVID-19 patients is not known. One&#xD;
      reason why researchers are interested in this drug is the HCQ's ability to modulate the&#xD;
      inflammatory response. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the body to bacteria, viruses,&#xD;
      or other substances that attack it. Our immune system usually attacks and actively kills&#xD;
      infected cells or foreign bodies. But this response may often fail to function properly&#xD;
      particularly in autoimmune disorders where the body is mistakenly attacking itself. HCQ has&#xD;
      subtle effects on a wide variety of immune cells, and it may be that one of these effects&#xD;
      helps stimulate the body's ability to fight off Covid-19. The inflammatory response in&#xD;
      COVID-19 can be so strong that it causes serious damage to the lungs, that is why patients&#xD;
      with severe infections need ventilators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another hypothesis on the rationale of the Antiviral activity of HCQ, is that HCQ may also&#xD;
      alter the ability of the virus to bind to the outside of a host cell in the first place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard of a drug trial is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study.&#xD;
      One group of participants should receive the investigational drug and another group should&#xD;
      receive a placebo. The individuals in each arm of the study should be randomized; the&#xD;
      demographics of both groups should be similar. Finally, the participants should not know if&#xD;
      they are receiving the investigational drug or a placebo and the healthcare workers should&#xD;
      not know what they are administering. Only under these conditions, It can conclusively&#xD;
      determine the safety and efficacy of a potential treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that there are no approved drugs&#xD;
      for COVID-19 treatment. Researchers around the globe, however, are researching different&#xD;
      medications for COVID-19 patients, including the drug Hydroxychloroquine, which is mainly&#xD;
      used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Malaria. Not enough data was obtained yet&#xD;
      to know how well all of these medications are functioning. Therefore, aim to perform a&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess the impact of these medications on healthcare&#xD;
      workers who exposed for the treatment of COVID -19 patients in Qatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational to conduct a clinical trial on HCQ: It is considered as a weak base. Many viruses&#xD;
      enter the host cells via endocytosis, as a result of which they are initially taken up into&#xD;
      an intracellular compartment that is &quot;typically fairly acidic&quot; whereas; Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      would alter the acidity of this compartment, which can interfere with the ability of viruses&#xD;
      to escape into the host cell and start replicating. Another hypothesis on the rationale of&#xD;
      the Antiviral activity of HCQ, is that HCQ may also alter the ability of the virus to bind to&#xD;
      the outside of a host cell in the first place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCQ will be more safe and effective in comparison to placebo in the prevention of COVID 19&#xD;
      cases, in healthcare workers exposed to COVID 19 patients.&#xD;
