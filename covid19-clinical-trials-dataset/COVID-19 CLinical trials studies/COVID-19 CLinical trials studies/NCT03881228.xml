  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reduces the risk of tuberculosis in 60%. Young children&#xD;
      are at higher risk of developing severe forms of TB, though this can be prevented with a full&#xD;
      course of IPT. Preliminary data indicate that 60% of eligible children start IPT, and 30%&#xD;
      complete it. Furthermore, children can be exposed to more than one case of TB in the&#xD;
      household. Adults exposed to TB in the household setting are not necessarily aware of their&#xD;
      risk. Uncertainties in the decisions of staff to prescribe IPT and limited health literacy&#xD;
      among caretakers and families contribute to this. The investigators will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of an intervention package to increase IPT adherence and completion among children &lt;&#xD;
      5 years old exposed to TB in the household. The investigators will assess the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention by 1) measuring IPT completion at 6 months after treatment initiation and by 2)&#xD;
      determining adherence to IPT by measuring isoniazid in urine at weeks 2, 8 and 24 in a random&#xD;
      cluster sample of 10 health facilities and 20 control facilities with 10 children included in&#xD;
      each facility (100 in intervention and 200 in control). The investigators will measure&#xD;
      fidelity and reach, and acceptability among caretakers and health staff. The intervention&#xD;
      package will consist of: 1) educational booklet for caretakers explaining why IPT needs to be&#xD;
      given 2) a children's storybook, with weekly installments, over the 6-month course of IPT as&#xD;
      a non-monetary incentive and 3) short messages services (SMS) reminders delivered to the&#xD;
      caretaker for the weekly pick-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2020, the protocol was updated to adapt to the COVID19 situation in Lima. One of&#xD;
      the secondary outcome (isoniazid concentration in urine) was cancelled and the full&#xD;
      intervention (educational booklet, weekly children storybook and weekly SMS) is now delivered&#xD;
      through WhatsApp.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized study was designed, randomizing 10 health facilities to the intervention&#xD;
      arm and 20 to control arm. In each, 10 children will be recruited. The mother, or the main&#xD;
      caretaker in the intervention arm will receive the intervention package: 1) an educational&#xD;
      booklet indicating the importance of IPT, adherence to IPT as well as information on how to&#xD;
      give it daily for six months. Thereafter, the mother or main caretaker receives 2) a chapter&#xD;
      of a children storybook delivered weekly and 3) SMS to remind her of the pick up, as well as&#xD;
      weekly SMS containing a motivating message. Until March 2020, component 1 and 2 of the&#xD;
      intervention package were delivered in person, since September 2020 and in adaptation to the&#xD;
      SARS Cov2 pandemic, these are delivered via WhatsApp. Children in the control arm will&#xD;
      receive the standard of care which consists of a advice and counseling given by the doctor&#xD;
      and nurse at the health facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the efficacy of the intervention by 1) measuring IPT completion&#xD;
      at 6 months after treatment initiation. The secondary outcome originally planned (determining&#xD;
      adherence to IPT by measuring isoniazid in urine at weeks 2, 8 and 24) has been cancelled in&#xD;
      adaptation to the SARS Cov2 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity, reach and acceptability will be measured among caretakers and staff with an in&#xD;
      depth interview at the end of the study.&#xD;
