    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection coud induce cardiac injuries. Before returning to sport, cardiac&#xD;
      evaluation is recommended by sports federations, based on the precautionary principle and the&#xD;
      opinion of expert consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to to determine the prevalence of abnormalities in cardiological&#xD;
      examinations realized in athletes who have suffered from COVID-19 infection, symptomatic or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac injuries linked to COVID-19 infection are frequently described in symptomatic and&#xD;
      hospitalized people and are associated with a poorer prognosis. The question of possible&#xD;
      myocardial damage in people without or moderately symptomatic is less established. The&#xD;
      presence of a myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection is a key issue for the sports&#xD;
      cardiologist since this cardiac inflammation may be associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      sudden death in the athlete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In absence of scientific data and on the basis of the precautionary principle, the ministry&#xD;
      (Guide to health recommendations for sports resumption, Sports French Ministry, May 2020),&#xD;
      sports federations and certain expert consensus have proposed in May 2020 after being&#xD;
      released from lockdown, algorithms for carrying out systematic cardiac examinations before&#xD;
      resuming intense sport (professional or high-level athletes). These algorithms typically&#xD;
      provide a comprehensive cardiac assessment with resting ECG, resting echocardiography, and&#xD;
      maximal exercice test. The performance of cardiac MRI, the most sensitive exam for detecting&#xD;
      possible myocarditis, remains at the discretion of the cardiologist depending on the&#xD;
      interpretation of the first examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given a much larger screening for COVID-19 infection than in March, with the performance of&#xD;
      virological PCR tests required weekly by certain sports federations, the prevalence of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection is important in the athletic population, mostly in a- or pauci-symptomatic&#xD;
      athletes. In case of positivity, a cardiac evaluation is therefore often recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of cardiac abnormality encountered&#xD;
      during cardiac examinations performed in athletes before resuming intense sport, after&#xD;
      infection with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is High-level athlete (professionals or high-level ministerial list),&#xD;
      who had a recent COVID 19 infection, symptomatic or not&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform this study, the investigators will use existing data from patients' medical&#xD;
      records (March 2019, March 2021). Anonymized data will be provided to the methodological team&#xD;
      for analysis. The data will be kept for 2 years after publication. The data collected will be&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the sport practiced&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age and sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of positive PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classification of the symptom intensities related to COVID-19 infection: (asymptomatic,&#xD;
           mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, cardiac symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead resting electrocardiogram (heart rate, interpretation by the cardiologist,&#xD;
           anomaly or not)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maxmal exercice test (maximum heart rate, maximum power or speed, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
           presence of arrhythmia or not)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting echocardiography (LVEF, overall LV longitudinal strain, abnormal or not in&#xD;
           segmental kinetics, presence or not of pericardial effusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI (if done): LVEF, presence of an abnormality or not, in particular late enhancement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Holter ECG if done (presence or not of arrhythmia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biology if done (increase or not in troponin or D-Dimers&#xD;
