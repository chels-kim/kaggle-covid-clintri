  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that large numbers of healthcare workers will experience a broad range of&#xD;
      psychological reactions and symptoms including anxiety, depression, moral distress, and&#xD;
      trauma symptoms that will cause both significant suffering as well as occupational and social&#xD;
      impairment. The purpose of this study is to find interventions which are helpful in treating&#xD;
      psychological distress in healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases of the study. All participants will take part in Phase I, which consists&#xD;
      of 4 sessions over a two-week period of either a narrative writing intervention or a medical&#xD;
      music intervention. Participants will be randomly assigned to the narrative writing&#xD;
      intervention or medical music intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Phase I, participants will be re-assessed. Healthcare workers who meet criteria for&#xD;
      PTSD will be given the option to participate in Phase II of the study, in which they will be&#xD;
      offered a choice between one of two evidence-based treatments for PTSD: Interpersonal Therapy&#xD;
      (IPT) or Exposure Therapy (ET). Both treatments are comprised of ten 75-minute sessions&#xD;
      scheduled twice weekly. Participants will be allowed to choose a preferred treatment in Phase&#xD;
      II. After Phase II participants will complete a final assessment concluding the study. All&#xD;
      interventions will be offered using distance technology.&#xD;
