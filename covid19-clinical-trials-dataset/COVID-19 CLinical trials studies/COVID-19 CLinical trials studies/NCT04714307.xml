  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research investigates how cognitive-affective aspects evolve during the course of&#xD;
      SCA3/MJD. Due to COVID-19 pandemics, this study protocol was adapted for online-only&#xD;
      consultations. Evaluations happening after March 2020 have been done by videocall with&#xD;
      patients, and no neurological evaluation was thus performed on these patients. A scale on&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living was added to the online protocol to replace SARA, SCAFI and CCFS&#xD;
      scales.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By the end of this study, the evaluated population will be composed of 144 participants: 36&#xD;
      ataxic SCA3/MJD carriers, 72 at 50% risk of carrying the SCA3/MJD mutation and 36 healthy&#xD;
      controls. Ataxic subjects are invited to participate if they have an established molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis of SCA3/MJD and have a SARA score greater than 2.5 points. At risk subjects are&#xD;
      composed by the offspring of molecularly diagnosed SCA3/MJD subjects that have a SARA&lt;3.&#xD;
      Healthy controls belonging either to families living with the disease or to the general&#xD;
      population are invited to participate according to how well they match with ataxic subjects&#xD;
      included in the study. Subjects are invited to participate in the study and, after&#xD;
      constentment procedures, cognitive-affective assessments and a scale on Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living (ADL) are performed on a videocall. At risk subjects collect a blood sample for double&#xD;
      bilnd determination of their carrier status. Before March 2020, all procedures were performed&#xD;
      in person and, instead of ADL, SARA, SCAFI and CCFS were obtained.&#xD;
