    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate MN-166 (ibudilast) in patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of&#xD;
      developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Subjects will be screened, randomly assigned&#xD;
      to MN-166 or placebo groups, receive study drug on Days 1-7, and followed up on Day 14 and&#xD;
      Day 28.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (1:1) double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of&#xD;
      ibudilast in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects at risk for developing ARDS receiving standard of&#xD;
      care including anticoagulation. The study will consist of a Screening Phase followed by a&#xD;
      Treatment and Follow-up Phase. Following the Screening Phase, if the subject meets&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, subject will be administered treatment with MN-166 (ibudilast) or&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will receive ibudilast 100 mg/d (50 mg b.i.d) or placebo every day for 7&#xD;
      days. Upon completion of the 7-day Treatment Phase, subject will be followed-up at Day 14 and&#xD;
      at Day 28 post baseline. Subjects discharged prior to Day 7 will be given the remainder of&#xD;
      their study medication to be taken at home twice daily and will be given a pulse oximeter to&#xD;
      measure their oxygen levels once daily until Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following screening assessments will be performed upon signing the ICF:&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria review, physical exam, assess vital signs and O2 use, clinical&#xD;
      status using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases scale, 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      draw blood for plasma biomarkers that include: migration inhibitory factor (MIF),&#xD;
      (interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP). A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),&#xD;
      D-dimer and coagulation tests will also be drawn. A serum pregnancy test will be done in&#xD;
      pre-menopausal females. Prior concomitant medications taken within the last 7 days prior to&#xD;
      study drug administration will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment Phase, hospitalized subjects will be treated with MN-166 or placebo for&#xD;
      a 7-day period. During the Treatment Phase, subjects will undergo study-related procedures&#xD;
      including physical exam, ECG, Oxygen use assessment, biomarkers and pharmacokinetic samples&#xD;
      draw, CBC, CMP, D-dimer blood collection, clinical assessment using the NIAID scale, and&#xD;
      information on adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Study Day 14, conduct physical examination, clinical status, vital signs and oxygen use,&#xD;
      ECG, CBC, CMP, D-dimer, and coagulation tests, biomarkers, AE and concomitant medications&#xD;
      review. On Day 28, subject's clinical status and survival status will be recorded.&#xD;
