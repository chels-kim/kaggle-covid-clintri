      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveitis refers to a large group of inflammatory diseases in the eye. The inflammation can be&#xD;
      caused by many factors, such as trauma, medicine, or infection. It can also be caused by&#xD;
      systemic diseases. Uveitis and ocular inflammation can cause vision loss. Both children and&#xD;
      adults can have uveitis. Standard treatment is to suppress the immune system. But this can&#xD;
      result in high costs as well as bad side effects. Researchers want to look at data from NEI&#xD;
      studies. They want to learn more about how uveitis progresses and responds to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find biomarkers to better understand uveitic diseases, assess disease severity, and create&#xD;
      outcome measures of response to treatment and disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 4 and older from certain NEI studies who have uveitis or ocular inflammation, and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be taken from NEI studies from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2025. Data will&#xD;
      only be collected for participants who agreed to let their data be used for future research.&#xD;
      No new tests will be done on any samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory results and images will be used. Medical chart data, such as symptoms, medicine&#xD;
      history, and treatment course, will be used. Personal data, such as name, medical record&#xD;
      number, and date of birth, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 has been reported to cause eye changes. Exam findings of participants who had&#xD;
      COVID-19 will be reviewed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning will be used to study the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at the NIH Clinical Center. All data will be securely stored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis refers to a large group of intraocular inflammatory diseases that can cause&#xD;
      devastating visual loss in adults and children. This is a retrospective study to identify&#xD;
      factors and biomarkers that are relevant to the pathogenesis, progression, and treatment&#xD;
      response in inflammatory eye conditions. The primary objective is to identify ocular imaging,&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory biomarkers in order to better classify presentations of uveitic&#xD;
      diseases, assess disease severity and develop outcome measures of response to treatment. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to identify etiological factors for uveitic diseases. The study&#xD;
      population include any patient with a diagnosis of uveitis or ocular inflammation enrolled in&#xD;
      an IRB approved protocol since 2000.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study population will include subjects aged 4 or older and no upper limit for age will&#xD;
        be set. All data will be derived only from subjects evaluated at the NEI eye clinic and&#xD;
        enrolled in NEI protocols. This also applies to data from healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects evaluated under the IRB protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
             AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of uveitis, ocular inflammation, scleritis or a disease known to be&#xD;
             associated with intraocular inflammation, (e.g., sarcoidosis, Beh(SqrRoot)(Beta)et s&#xD;
             disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and lymphoma or COVID-19 or other infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Serve as a control:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. unaffected control (healthy volunteer) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. control with non-inflammatory related eye disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients without appropriate diagnostic and laboratory investigations for their&#xD;
        diagnosis. Disease specific exclusion criteria will also be used. Patients will be excluded&#xD;
        if appropriate laboratory investigations were not performed such as infectious serological&#xD;
        tests and autoimmune labs. For posterior segment uveitis with retinal vasculitis, patients&#xD;
        without fluorescein angiography will be excluded. Similarly, patients with choroiditis will&#xD;
        be excluded if fundus autofluorescence studies were not performed. These disease specific&#xD;
        exclusion criteria do not apply to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
