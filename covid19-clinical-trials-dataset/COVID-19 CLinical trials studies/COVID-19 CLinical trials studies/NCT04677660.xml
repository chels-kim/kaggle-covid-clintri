  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TAK-919 is a vaccine in development to protect people against Covid-19. The main aims of the&#xD;
      study are to learn if TAK-919 can protect people from Covid-19 and to check for side effects&#xD;
      from TAK-919.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. Those who can&#xD;
      take part will be chosen for 1 of 2 treatments by chance. Participants will either receive an&#xD;
      injection of TAK-919 or a placebo in their arm. In this study, a placebo will look like the&#xD;
      TAK-919 vaccine but will not have any medicine in it. 3 times as many participants will&#xD;
      receive TAK-919 than placebo. Participants will receive 2 injections of TAK-919 or placebo,&#xD;
      28 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to record their temperature and any medical problems in an&#xD;
      electronic diary for up to 7 days after each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will visit the clinic for regular check-ups, blood tests, and&#xD;
      sometimes for nose swab samples. When all participants have visited their clinic 28 days&#xD;
      after their 2nd injection, the study sponsor (Takeda) will check how many participants have&#xD;
      made enough antibodies to protect them against Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will stay in the study for up to 12 months after they have had their 2nd&#xD;
      injection. During this time, the study doctors will continue to check how many participants&#xD;
      have made enough antibodies to protect them against Covid-19. Also, they will check if&#xD;
      participants have any more side effects from TAK-919 or the placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-919. TAK-919 is being tested to prevent&#xD;
      infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
      This study will look at the safety and immunogenicity of 2 doses of TAK-919 by intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) injection in healthy Japanese male and female adults, given 28 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 200 healthy volunteers. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will&#xD;
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an&#xD;
      urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-919 0.5 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo- this is an injection that looks like the study drug but has no active&#xD;
           ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take intramuscular injection in the upper arm twice&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 12 months from the second vaccination. Participants will make multiple visits to the&#xD;
      clinic and will be contacted by telephone or a final visit after the last vaccination for a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment.&#xD;
