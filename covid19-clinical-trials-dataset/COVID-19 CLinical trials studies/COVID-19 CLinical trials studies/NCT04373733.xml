  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently we do not know how best to treat patients infected with COVID-19. This study is&#xD;
      looking at whether randomising participants to either favipiravir or to usual care, can help&#xD;
      patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomised, open label study of the combined use of favipiravir and standard&#xD;
      clinical care verses standard clinical care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-based software will randomise participants 1:1 to either receive favipiravir and&#xD;
      standard medical care or standard medical care alone. The allocated medical regime will&#xD;
      commence for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research blood, sputum nose swab and urine samples will be collected at baseline, as well as&#xD;
      between day 5 and 10, and between day 14 and 28 to enable comparative analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A COVID-19 antibody test will also be performed 14-28 days after randomisation. In the event&#xD;
      of clinically indicated bronchoscopy taking place within 28 days of consent then additional&#xD;
      bronchoscopy washing and brushing samples and paired blood sample will be taken for research&#xD;
      purposes If a participant is discharged before one of the latter time points, they will be&#xD;
      required to return to hospital (provided they are well enough) for the collection of repeat&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored whilst taking the study medications. Participants will&#xD;
      study exit at subject death or 28 days post-randomisation.&#xD;
