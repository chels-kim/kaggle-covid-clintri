    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-arm study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of BIO 300 Oral Suspension (BIO 300) for the mitigation of impaired pulmonary&#xD;
      function in 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients recently discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive BIO 300 or placebo. All patients will&#xD;
      receive the same background current standard of care.&#xD;

             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or&#xD;
             interpretation of the data obtained from the study.&#xD;
