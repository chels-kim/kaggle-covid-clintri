      This is an Early Feasibility Study (EFS) investigating the use of the Hemopurifier® in the&#xD;
      treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Disease (COVID-19).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be patients with COVID-19 who are severely affected or at high risk&#xD;
      for severe disease. Up to 40 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 infection are confirmed by&#xD;
      Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR, will be enrolled in up to 20 investigational sites.&#xD;
      Once patients are identified and consented, either a double-lumen hemodialysis catheter,&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula, or graft must be present for treatment. Patients will receive a four&#xD;
      to six-hour treatment with the Hemopurifier® extracorporeal therapy daily for up to four days&#xD;
      until discontinued because of clinical improvement or deterioration or upon the decision of&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator. The Hemopurifier® will be placed within the extracorporeal&#xD;
      circuit and with all connections secured, treatment will utilize a blood pump at an initial&#xD;
      flow rate of 100mL/min. The blood flow rate is to be increased gradually in a stepwise&#xD;
      fashion over the first minutes to a maximum blood flow rate of 200mL/min. The circuit must be&#xD;
      continually monitored for blood leaks and blood clotting within the device. If the treatment&#xD;
      is halted before 4 hours, another device may be connected, and the treatment may be restarted&#xD;
      with a goal of achieving a minimum of 4 hours of therapy. If the device shows signs of&#xD;
      clotting or blood leaks, the treatment must be paused, the blood will be returned to the&#xD;
      patient and a new device will be placed within the extracorporeal circuit. The therapy will&#xD;
      be resumed with consideration of altering the level of anticoagulation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This trial will evaluate the use of the Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Virus Disease (COVID-19). The Hemopurifier is a blood filtration device similar to a kidney dialysis cartridge which is designed to remove viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The study will evaluate whether the device is safe in COVID-19 patients along with clearing virus and improving outcomes in infected patients. Enrolled subjects will already have a large intravenous catheter placed for the treatment of kidney injury and will have their blood filtered through the Hemopurifier. Subjects will receive a four to six hour treatment with the Hemopurifier® extracorporeal therapy daily for up to four days until discontinued because of clinical improvement or deterioration or upon decision of the Principal Investigator.</intervention_model_description>
