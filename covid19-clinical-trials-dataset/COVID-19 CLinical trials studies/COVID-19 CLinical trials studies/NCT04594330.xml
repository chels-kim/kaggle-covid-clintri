  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) contains multiple compounds which have antibacterial, antiviral, and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties. The role of VCO as an antivirus to treat COVID-19 requires&#xD;
      further studies. A previous study has investigated the used of 30 ml of VCO to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers for a month and reported no side effect. Here the investigators conduct a pilot&#xD;
      trial to investigate the effect of VCO towards the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in&#xD;
      Indonesia.&#xD;

      The subjects of this pilot study are patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Central Public&#xD;
      Hospital Dr. Sardjito, Teaching Hospital of Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), and Yogyakarta&#xD;
      COVID-19 referral hospitals (RSUD Wonosari and Sleman). The COVID-19 patients are recruited&#xD;
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, then divided randomly into two groups.&#xD;
      Group I, the intervention group, consists of COVID-19 patients receiving standard therapy and&#xD;
      15 mL of VCO twice a day for 14 days. Group II, the control group, consists of COVID-19&#xD;
      patients receiving standard therapy and 15 mL of placebo twice a day for 14 days. Both groups&#xD;
      are monitored for four weeks with a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) swab test.&#xD;
