    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges with implications for wellbeing and&#xD;
      mental health. The Southampton Women's Survey provides the opportunity to understand&#xD;
      influences on these important outcomes amongst women and their offspring in the context of an&#xD;
      established longitudinal cohort study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1998 and 2002 the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) team interviewed 12,583&#xD;
      Southampton women aged 20 to 34 years. The baseline survey collected data on women's diets,&#xD;
      lifestyles, body and blood measures, reproductive health, education, mental health and social&#xD;
      circumstances. Of these participants, 3,158 women subsequently became pregnant within the&#xD;
      study period and delivered a liveborn singleton infant. The survey has followed up the&#xD;
      offspring and mothers with home visits at six months, one, two and three years. A sample of&#xD;
      over 1,000 offspring was seen at 4 years of age, more than 2,000 offspring were seen at ages&#xD;
      6-7 years, and more than 1,000 at 8-9 years. Follow-up of offspring aged 11-13 years is being&#xD;
      completed and at 17-19 years is being piloted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women are currently aged 37 to 57 years and the offspring are currently aged 12 to 21&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unique challenges across the population. The effects&#xD;
      include those of the threat of the virus itself as well as the impact of the&#xD;
      government-imposed lockdown on health and wellbeing. Research in many contexts will allow&#xD;
      greater understanding of the repercussions of this unprecedented event. The Southampton&#xD;
      Women's Survey provides an opportunity to understand the effects of the lockdown on a&#xD;
      well-characterised cohort of women and their adolescent/young adult offspring. The&#xD;
      longitudinal data available in the cohort will provide a unique opportunity to understand how&#xD;
      circumstances earlier in life (including pre-pregnancy) influence people's health and&#xD;
      wellbeing during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To collect individual level data relating to health and wellbeing during the COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic amongst SWS women and their offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether lockdown-specific pressures such as working from home, home schooling&#xD;
           and lack of social contact are associated with health and wellbeing during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To use longitudinal data to understand how health and lifestyle in earlier life&#xD;
           (including pre-pregnancy) are associated with health and wellbeing during the pandemic.&#xD;
