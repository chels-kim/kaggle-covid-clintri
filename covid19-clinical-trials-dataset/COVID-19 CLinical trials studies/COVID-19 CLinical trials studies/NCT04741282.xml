    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate efficacy of internet based pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      and progressive muscle relaxation program on functional capacity, depression and anxiety,&#xD;
      dyspnea, fatigue, sleep quality and quality of life in covid19 patients after hospital&#xD;
      discharge&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid19) could cause respiratory and physical dysfunction,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression, fatigue and affect sleep quality and quality of life in infected&#xD;
      patient after hospital discharge. there is expect that pulmonary rehabilitation can improve&#xD;
      these symptoms and prevent complications in these cases. It seems that Progressive muscle&#xD;
      relaxation exercise could improve pulmonary rehabilitation effect. Due to social isolation of&#xD;
      Covid 19 patients after hospital discharge, internet base rehabilitation will be used in this&#xD;
      study. participants will be randomized in two pulmonary tele-rehabilitation groups after&#xD;
      hospital discharge. One group will be received pulmonary rehabilitation include education,&#xD;
      breathing exercises, aerobic and upper and lower limbs muscle strengthening exercises.&#xD;
      Another group will be perform progressive muscle relaxation in addition of these exercise.&#xD;
      Treatment duration is 6 week with 5 days/week frequency. Two exercise sessions per week will&#xD;
      be supervised with expert physiotherapist via videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at baseline, within two week and at the end of six week exercises&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
