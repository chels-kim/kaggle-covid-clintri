  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 22% of the global population is at an increased risk of a severe form of&#xD;
      COVID-19, while one in four coronavirus patients admitted to intensive care unit will develop&#xD;
      a pulmonary embolism. A major public health question remains to be investigated: why COVID-19&#xD;
      is mild for some, critically severe for others and why only a percentage of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      develop thrombosis, despite the disease's proven hypercoagulable state? Patients' intrinsic&#xD;
      characteristics might be responsible for the deep variety of disease forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to assess the validity of the hypothesis according to which underlining&#xD;
      genetic variations might be responsible for different degrees of severity and thrombotic&#xD;
      events risks in the novel coronavirus disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we suspect that prothrombotic genotypes occuring in the genes that encode&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-DEL/INS) and angiotensinogen (AGT M235T) are involved in&#xD;
      the unpredictable evolution of COVID-19, both in terms of severity and thrombotic events, due&#xD;
      to the strong interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system&#xD;
      (RAAS). Therefore, we also aim to assess the validity of the theory according to which there&#xD;
      is a pre-existing atypical modulation of RAAS in COVID-19 patients that develop severe forms&#xD;
      and/or thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is based on various observations. Firstly, there is a substantial similarity&#xD;
      with a reasonably related condition such as sepsis, for which there is a validated theory&#xD;
      stating that thrombophilic mutations affect patients' clinical response. Secondly, racial and&#xD;
      ethnic genetic differences are responsible for significant dissimilar thrombotic risks among&#xD;
      various nations. Thirdly, an increase in stroke incidence has been reported in young patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19, without essential thrombosis risk factors, favoring the idea that a genetic&#xD;
      predisposition could contribute to increase the thrombotic and thromboembolic risk. Fourthly,&#xD;
      the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 4G/5G inherited mutation was found to be&#xD;
      responsible for a thrombotic state causing post-SARS osteonecrosis.&#xD;

      The study's protocol will cover the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Collected data from COVID-19 patients at admission will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive general demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous pathologies and thrombosis risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine biological data (the blood routinely collected will also be used for SARS-Cov-2&#xD;
           specific RT-PCR exam)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete thrombophilic profile testing by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization of DNA to&#xD;
      assess the presence of prothrombotic genotypes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factor V Leiden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factor V 4070 A G (Hr2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factor II G20210A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  ACE-DEL/INS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AGT M235T&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR-1) A1166C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrinogen - 455 G A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factor XIII Val34Leu SpO2, respiratory rate, PaO2/FiO2 RAAS components&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Imagistic procedures (chest X-ray or CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients will be divided into three groups depending on disease severity and&#xD;
                     the presence of thrombotic state:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1st group includes COVID-19 patients with proved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis&#xD;
           occurring in more atypical places such as in the veins of the brain, liver, kidney,&#xD;
           mesenteric vein and the veins of the arms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or arterial thrombosis (heart attacks, strokes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2nd group encompasses asymptomatic patients and those with mild or moderate&#xD;
                disease, according to current guidelines, without thrombosis: no symptoms or&#xD;
                evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a SpO2&#xD;
                ≥ 94%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3rd group includes severe disease, according to current guidelines, without&#xD;
                thrombosis: respiratory frequency &gt; 30 breaths per minute, SpO2 &lt; 94%, PaO2/FiO2 &lt;&#xD;
                300 mmHg, or lung infiltrates &gt;50%&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Statistical methods will be employed to check for significant differences&#xD;
                     between prothrombotic mutations frequency and RAAS components levels for the&#xD;
                     three groups&#xD;
