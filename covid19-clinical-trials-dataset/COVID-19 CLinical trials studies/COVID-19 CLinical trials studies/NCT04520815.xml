  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress (ARD) is one of the most frequent reasons for consultation and&#xD;
      hospitalization in emergency medicine. The use of ultrasound methods as a diagnostic and&#xD;
      clinical assessment tool in emergency medicine is increasingly important. As such, ultrasound&#xD;
      is a simple, non-invasive means of assessing diaphragmatic function in the patient's bed.&#xD;
      Several methods of ultrasound assessment of diaphragm function have been described. Among&#xD;
      these different methods, the diaphragmatic excursion seems to have a better intra and&#xD;
      interobserver reproducibility as well as a greater feasibility, in particular because of its&#xD;
      speed of realization and its learning curve seeming faster in comparison with the&#xD;
      measurement. of the thickening fraction. Measuring the diaphragmatic excursion could&#xD;
      therefore ultimately represent a simple means of assessing respiratory function, both&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic, in patients with acute respiratory distress in the emergency&#xD;
      departments. The etiologies of acute respiratory distress in very elderly patients (i.e.&gt; 75&#xD;
      years) admitted to the emergency reception service are multiple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no data available in the literature on the prevalence of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction and its short- and long-term course in this category of patients.&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is therefore to assess the prevalence of diaphragmatic&#xD;
      dysfunction and its evolutionary kinetics in patients over the age of 75 admitted for acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress in the emergency medicine department.&#xD;
