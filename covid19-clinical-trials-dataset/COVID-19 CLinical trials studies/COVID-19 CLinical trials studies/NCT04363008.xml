  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergent experimental and anecdotal evidence has indicated that critically ill COVID-19&#xD;
      patients demonstrate two patient sub-types (called phenotypes). In one group the disease&#xD;
      progresses slowly and patients have a low potential of developing mild respiratory failure,&#xD;
      but in the other group, an exaggerated immune response (hyper-inflammation/cytokine storm)&#xD;
      may be linked to the onset of precipitous respiratory failure, termed acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome. This syndrome is responsible for a large portion of COVID-19 associated&#xD;
      mortality. Thus, determining links between hyper-inflammation and acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome in COVID-19 patients is of immediate importance. Blood samples will undergo a number&#xD;
      of analyses to help us to understand as much as possible about COVID-19. We will also study&#xD;
      any differences in physiologic and cytokine levels before and after patients are treated with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapies as part of clinical care in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

      PURPOSES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the prevalence of a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory &quot;cytokine storm&quot; phenotype in&#xD;
           patients at Vancouver General Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine any potential links between cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to identify biomarkers that&#xD;
           could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who require urgent care from&#xD;
           those that will recover on their own&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Elucidate the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine differences in physiologic and cytokine levels before and after patients&#xD;
           are treated with immunomodulatory therapies as part of clinical care in COVID-19&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary: Based off of previous reports, approximately 50% of COVID-19 patients will&#xD;
           demonstrate a cytokine storm phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary: a)Patients exhibiting cytokine storm will demonstrate a higher incidence of&#xD;
           ARDS b)We will identify biomarkers for rapid testing c)Host gene variation will&#xD;
           influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2019 novel human coronavirus, originally named 2019-nCoV, and now referred to as the&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan of the&#xD;
      Hubei Province in China late December 2019. This virus causes the disease now known as&#xD;
      COVID-19. Following its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has since had its genome sequenced and cell&#xD;
      entry receptor determined. Its rapid global spread and evidence of community transmission&#xD;
      indicate a likely protracted influence on our health care system and economy. This&#xD;
      necessitates a coordinated response from health care workers and scientists to discern&#xD;
      strategies for the treatment, and therapeutic management of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside of vaccine and anti-viral development efforts, the focus on novel therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions has been comparatively minimal, with few clinical trial reports to date, which&#xD;
      has elicited a call to action to explore host-directed therapies in addition to other&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. Recently published clinical descriptions of this disease have&#xD;
      indicated that many patients suffer from both a hyper-inflammatory state, referred to as a&#xD;
      &quot;cytokine storm&quot; with subsequent death often attributable to the development of acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, while cytokine storm appears associated with&#xD;
      disease severity, key links between the presence of cytokine storm and development of ARDS,&#xD;
      which is currently responsible for the largest proportion of COVID-19 deaths, has yet to be&#xD;
      established. Delineation of such a link and clinical establishment of a hyper-inflammatory&#xD;
      (i.e. cytokine storm) phenotype would provide precedence for specific anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      treatments to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 associated ARDS and mortality as this remains&#xD;
      debated currently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CyTOF analyses: is a single cell proteomic tool that will be applied using a custom panel of&#xD;
      31 monoclonal antibodies we developed to the widest possible array of blood lineage cells.&#xD;
      McNagny developed this technology as a platform for the AllerGEN NCE (Associate Scientific&#xD;
      Director of this NCE). It identifies, in unprecedented detail, rare subsets of mature blood&#xD;
      and progenitor cells. It includes markers of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play potent&#xD;
      roles in priming immune responses and also bone marrow blood cell progenitors. Chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and severe acute inflammation both lead to a rapid ramping up of inflammatory&#xD;
      cell production and premature release of bone marrow progenitors. The panel has been&#xD;
      internally validated and shown utility in identifying adult patients with chronic allergic&#xD;
      disease, a population which appears to be more severely impacted by respiratory infections.&#xD;
      There will be a goal to profile patients with mild and severe disease in an attempt to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers that could be developed into a rapid test for triaging patients who&#xD;
      require urgent care from those that will recover on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic Testing: Authors have shown that host genetic differences have a significant impact&#xD;
      on the clinical outcomes of sepsis. For instance, we have shown that a single nucleotide&#xD;
      variant in the CETP gene more than doubles the risk of 28-day mortality from sepsis. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that similar to other forms of critical illness, host gene variation will also&#xD;
      influence the clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection. This work is designed to elucidate&#xD;
      the impact of genetic variation on clinical outcomes from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA Testing: Circulating cell-free RNA species are typically encapsulated in extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles (EVs) that shield them from degradation in body fluids. A wide variety of&#xD;
      circulating RNA biotypes are present, with micro RNAs (miRNAs) being the most studied class.&#xD;
      These and other circulating RNAs can participate in cell-to-cell communication, can be&#xD;
      differentially expressed in patients compared to controls, and can be associated with disease&#xD;
      progression, dissemination, or drug responses in a variety of acute and critical care&#xD;
      indications including sepsis, neurotrauma, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions are optimized to obtain reliable and complete circulating RNA data from minimal&#xD;
      input volumes of human plasma or serum. Initial studies using 200 ul serum yielded ~15ng RNA,&#xD;
      clearly exceeding the minimal input of 100pg to generate libraries for next generation&#xD;
      sequencing. Pilot analysis from 3 healthy human volunteer donors passed quality criteria&#xD;
      exceeding 10M reads/sample and confirmed that 98% of exosomal miRNAs were detected in total&#xD;
      signatures of an average of 359 miRNAs. Importantly, this method also yields data on the&#xD;
      entire transcriptional landscape of potentially informative circulating RNAs from sample&#xD;
      volumes very feasible for clinical studies. Further optimization studies using both serum and&#xD;
      plasma from a single human donor showed that good quality RNA data could be obtained from as&#xD;
      little as 50Âµl input volume and that the expected RNA biotype distributions were found for&#xD;
      both serum and plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better understand 1)the links between cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients 2)the&#xD;
      biomarker profile of COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease 3)the impact of genetic&#xD;
      variation on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Acuity Unit (HAU) at Vancouver&#xD;
      General Hospital (VGH) or Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH) with suspected COVID-19 will be&#xD;
      quarantined in an isolation unit. Here, specimens will be collected for laboratory&#xD;
      confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical care will commence, and be guided by the discretion of&#xD;
      attending physicians in accordance with VGH/VCH's current operating procedure for the&#xD;
      management of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once clinical care has commenced, a blood sample will be collected on days 1-7, 10, 14, and&#xD;
      21 following ICU/HAU admission by clinical staff in the ICU/HAU into vacutainer serum&#xD;
      separator tubes (SST, VacutainerÂ®, Becton &amp; Dickinson). These samples will be analyzed for a&#xD;
      panel of cytokines, inflammatory markers, CyTOF, RNA and genetic testing. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed at 1)Dr Cheryl Wellington's lab at the David Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health&#xD;
      (UBC), 2)Dr Kelly McNagny's lab, DMCBH, UBC., 3)Dr. Liam Brunham's lab at the Centre for&#xD;
      Heart Lung Innovation (HLI), St Paul's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested matched cohort study will be conducted to examine the changes in the changes in&#xD;
      ventilator free days, PaO2/FiO2 and inflammatory cytokines before after administration of&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapies which are administration as part of routine clinical care for&#xD;
      cytokine storm syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recency of this disease outbreak makes robust statistical power testing difficult.&#xD;
      However by digitizing data from Huang and colleague's recent work, which is one of several&#xD;
      reports demonstrating cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-patients, a sample calculation&#xD;
      based off of their IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-Î± data is provided. The below presented power&#xD;
      calculations are for independent samples non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test and were&#xD;
      conducted in G*power (V3.1.9.1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-1: This was not significantly different in the report by Huang and colleagues (Huang et&#xD;
      al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2: With the estimated meanÂ±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 9.5Â±4.3 and 6.7Â±4.3&#xD;
      pg/mL of IL-2 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,~40 patients per&#xD;
      group (80 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-6: This was not measured by Huang and colleagues (Huang et al., 2020), however, with a&#xD;
      sample size of 150 patients total, Ruan and colleagues were able to detect significant&#xD;
      differences in IL-6 levels (Ruan et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-10: With the estimated meanÂ±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 19.5Â±39.6 and 5.3Â±4.3&#xD;
      pg/mL of IL-10 in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~60 patients&#xD;
      per group (120 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNF-Î±: With the estimated meanÂ±SD derived from Huang and Colleagues of 93.2Â±20.8 and&#xD;
      71.7Â±21.4 pg/mL of TNF-Î± in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, ~17&#xD;
      patients per group (34 total) would be needed to detect a difference (power = 0.80, alpha =&#xD;
      0.05)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above presented sample size estimates, that a marked difference in IL-6 was also&#xD;
      reported by Ruan and colleagues, and the anticipated admission rate of COVID-19 patients over&#xD;
      the next several months, we aim to recruit up to 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A log2 fold change &gt;1 and an adjusted p value of &lt;0.05 will be used as the threshold of&#xD;
      significance for differentially regulated RNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis will be used to&#xD;
      Identify causal networks, with further analysis set at a threshold of a negative log p value&#xD;
      &gt;20. We will use the Antimicrobial Response, Inflammatory Response and Infectious Disease&#xD;
      filters to identify SARS-CoV-2 relevant RNAs. Heat maps will be generated by comparison&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: We will compare the levels of cytokines between patients that develop ARDS and those&#xD;
      that do not. We will use independent samples t-tests in the data is normal (determined via&#xD;
      Shapiro Wilks test), or Mann-Whitney-U tests if the data is not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori analysis: We will assess the effects of immunosuppresant or anti-viral miedcations&#xD;
      given as part of clinical care out physiological outcomes and the changes in the serum&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: In exploratory analyses aimed at fulfilling our secondary aim, we will utilize our&#xD;
      daily cytokine measures to determine if there are cytokine thresholds that are associated&#xD;
      with the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested matched cohort study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the differences in the ventilator free days in the tocilizumab (administered as&#xD;
           part of clinical care) and supportive groups using an independent samples two-tailed&#xD;
           t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the differences in the cardiorespiratory physiologic outcomes (PaO2/FiO2, mean&#xD;
           arterial pressure and heart rate) in the tocilizumab (administered as part of clinical&#xD;
           care) and supportive groups using independent samples two-tailed t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the differences in serum inflammatory cytokines in the tocilizumab (administered&#xD;
           as part of clinical care) and supportive groups using independent samples two-tailed&#xD;
           t-tests.&#xD;
