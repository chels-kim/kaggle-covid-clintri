  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of delivering clinical mindfulness groups&#xD;
      for families affected with postpartum depression and anxiety (PPDA). Families with PPDA are a&#xD;
      vulnerable population who already face challenges during the postpartum period, but now the&#xD;
      Covid-19 era has brought extra challenges - lower availability of family members or support&#xD;
      systems to help in person, older children at home as childcare facilities are closed, etc.&#xD;
      Clinical mindfulness groups are now being run online to support this population, with the&#xD;
      current barriers of having to stay at home. Through this study, we want to capture the&#xD;
      challenges that both clinicians and participants might face using virtual platforms (e.g.&#xD;
      technical difficulties), to see whether online delivery of clinical mindfulness groups is&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression and anxiety (PPDA) is a prevalent condition, affecting about every 1 in&#xD;
      5 families. This not only impacts the parent diagnosed with PPDA but also affects&#xD;
      relationships with the rest of the family, ability to bond with her child, and can cause&#xD;
      tension between the parents. Thus, it is important that steps are taken to effectively treat&#xD;
      and support families affected by PPDA in a timely manner. On top of the struggles with a&#xD;
      newborn baby, the Covid era has brought along some new challenges. One such challenge is that&#xD;
      many healthcare providers and clinics have limited capacities or the care they provide may be&#xD;
      limited due to lockdown and Covid-19. Another challenge is the decreased in-person support&#xD;
      from family and other support systems, as well as having older children at home all the time&#xD;
      due to childcare facilities being closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is important to offer this population some support, this study is being conducted to&#xD;
      see if continuing the clinical groups and turning them onto a distant, online format would be&#xD;
      possible, and if it would work for both clinicians and the postpartum population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of running online clinical mindfulness&#xD;
      groups, particularly examining whether patients are able to access and continue with the&#xD;
      online sessions. Feasibility will be assessed by frequency of technical difficulties faced by&#xD;
      patients or clinicians and number of disruptions or episodes of parents leaving their screens&#xD;
      (e.g. to calm their child), self-report items of how participants found attending online&#xD;
      sessions and following the program, and attendance and drop-out rates. Secondary outcomes of&#xD;
      this study include reasons for drop-outs, satisfaction and acceptability, couple&#xD;
      interactions, and mental health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mindfulness groups will be rooted in the evidence-based 8-week programs, including&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and&#xD;
      adapted for this population needs. The mindfulness groups will run once a week, totalling 8&#xD;
      sessions over the course of 8 weeks. These groups will be run by trained clinicians and&#xD;
      mindfulness facilitators and will be a part of the RMH clinical program.&#xD;
