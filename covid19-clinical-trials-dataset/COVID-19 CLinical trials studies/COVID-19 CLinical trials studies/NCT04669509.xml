  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to primarily affecting the lungs, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) disease can&#xD;
      also affect many different organs, especially the heart, kidneys, liver and brain. In this&#xD;
      group of patients, the impact of an important organ such as the liver can lead to a further&#xD;
      deterioration of the clinical course. In this study, critical patients admitted to Gazi&#xD;
      Yasargil Training and Research Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 between&#xD;
      April 1 and October 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The effect of liver damage on&#xD;
      mortality in critical COVID-19 patients was investigated. The necessary permits for the study&#xD;
      were obtained from the Scientific Research Platform of the T.R. Ministry of Health.&#xD;
      (20.11.2020) Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 on the specified dates, followed in the ICU,&#xD;
      older than 18 years, identified as critical/serious according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization and provisional guidelines of the Scientific Board of the T.R. Ministry of&#xD;
      Health will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU patients without COVID-19, COVID-19 patients under 18 years of age,COVID-19 patients with&#xD;
      known liver disease, and COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' age, gender, comorbidity, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE&#xD;
      II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores when first admitted to the ICU,&#xD;
      hemogram parameters (white blood cell count, neutrophil, lymphocyte, hemoglobin, platelet&#xD;
      count), coagulation parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and&#xD;
      D-dimer, blood biochemistry results (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine&#xD;
      kinase , alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin,&#xD;
      direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin), procalcitonin and ferritin levels will be recorded.&#xD;
      In addition, the number of days spent in the ICU and whether mortality develops or not will&#xD;
      be recorded. It will also be recorded whether mortality develops on day 7 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into three groups according to their ALT, AST and total bilirubin&#xD;
      levels at the time of admission to the ICU. Group 1 will consist of patients with normal ALT,&#xD;
      AST and total bilirubin values. Group 2 will consist of patients whose ALT, AST or total&#xD;
      bilirubin levels are up to 3 times upper limit of normal. Group 3 will consist of patients&#xD;
      whose ALT, AST or total bilirubin levels are increased more than 3 times upper limit of&#xD;
      normal.&#xD;
