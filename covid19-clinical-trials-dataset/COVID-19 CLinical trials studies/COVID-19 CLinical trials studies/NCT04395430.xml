  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, which was first&#xD;
      identified in December 2019 and has then spread rapidly around the world. COVID-19 spreads&#xD;
      mainly through respiratory droplets and causes people to experience mild to moderate&#xD;
      respiratory illness. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19&#xD;
      a pandemic. With the surge in cases and to contain the spread of this disease, Singapore&#xD;
      implemented a circuit breaker to reduce movements and interactions in public and private&#xD;
      places. People are advised to stay at home and practise social distancing. With restrictions&#xD;
      in movements, parents and children are likely to be more sedentary in this pandemic. There is&#xD;
      an urgent need to move face-to-face interventions to online interventions as it is important&#xD;
      to be active in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childhood obesity threatens the health of US and Singapore populations. In the US, 30% of&#xD;
      children are overweight, 17% have obesity, and 8% have severe obesity. In Singapore, 13% of&#xD;
      children have obesity, and approximately half of all overweight children live in Asia. In&#xD;
      both countries the prevalence is increasing, especially amongst the lower income populations,&#xD;
      and is associated with future cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In US, obesity is most&#xD;
      prevalent in Black and Hispanic populations and in Singapore, obesity affects Malays and&#xD;
      Indians disproportionately. The underlying drivers and potential solutions thus share many&#xD;
      common factors. The current evidence shows a clear dose-response effect with increasing&#xD;
      number of hours of treatment, with a threshold for effectiveness at &gt; 25 hours over a 6-month&#xD;
      period. A key gap in delivering this recommendation is meeting the intensity, and delivering&#xD;
      comprehensive treatment that is culturally relevant, engaging to families, and integrated&#xD;
      within the community context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an online pilot randomised controlled trial among children aged 4-6 with&#xD;
      obesity, in Singapore, to test a novel school-clinic-community online intervention, the KK&#xD;
      Hospital (KKH) Sports Singapore program, for child obesity treatment with usual care. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is intensity of treatment as measured by hours of exposure to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online KKH Sports Singapore program involves 3-4 weekly online sessions of physical&#xD;
      activity and nutrition lessons for children and parents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through this trial, the investigators will address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate implementation feasibility and fidelity of the Duke community-based&#xD;
           intervention model into an online model. The investigators hypothesise that the&#xD;
           evidence-based implementation strategy tested in the US with Parks and Recreation will&#xD;
           be adaptable for use at Duke-National University Singapore (NUS) with Singapore Sport,&#xD;
           leading to online implementation within a 3-month period, and children in the&#xD;
           intervention will receive up to 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To meet current recommendations for intensity of obesity treatment. As compared with&#xD;
           usual care, the investigators hypothesise that children in the online intervention will&#xD;
           be more likely to receive &gt;25 hours over 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the effectiveness of the online intervention. Children who participate in&#xD;
           the online intervention, as compared with usual care, will demonstrate improvements in&#xD;
           health outcomes at 6-months, including cardiorespiratory fitness, weight-related quality&#xD;
           of life and stabilisation or reduction in BMI at 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure change in quality of life at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL; US version 4). PedsQL is a comprehensive and multi-dimensional construct that includes physical, emotional, and social functioning to assess quality of life in the children. It uses a 5-point Likert scale where 0= never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = almost always. Items will be reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale so that higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure change in self-esteem at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Self-esteem is measured using the Behavioural Rating Scale of Presented Self-Esteem questionnaire. The first category of items consists of active displays of confidence, curiosity, initiative, exploration and independence while the second category consists of adaptive reactions to change or stress. It uses a four-point scale from 1-4 where higher scores indicate higher self-esteem.</description>

    <measure>Change in eating behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure change in eating behaviour at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Eating behaviour is measured using the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). The questionnaire consists of 35 items and measures food responsiveness, emotional over-eating, enjoyment of food, desire to drink, satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, emotional under-eating and food fussiness using a 5-point Likert scale (1= never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always). Higher scores indicate higher level of behaviour in the respective dimensions.</description>

    <measure>Change in gross motor skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure change in gross motor skills at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Gross motor skills is measured using the Test of Gross Motor Development (Ver. 3.0). The first subtest, Locomotor, measures the gross motor skills that require fluid coordinated movements of the body as the child moves in one direction or another. The second subtest, Ball Skills, measure the gross motor skills that demonstrate efficient throwing, striking, and catching movements.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive standard care and basic sports equipment and cooking materials for the online programme.&#xD;
The online programme will be available up to 4 days per week (Weekdays evenings and Weekends mornings or early afternoons) and all household family members are invited to participate. The majority of the programming will be run by trained research coordinator and volunteers from KKH and Sports Singapore coaches. A regular rotation of comprehensive programming is provided, which includes online fitness, cooking, nutrition, and peer support classes. Every session includes up to 60 minutes of exercise and/or active play, and each session has an additional special 'theme.' For example, one to two sessions per week includes nutrition related programming (e.g., cooking classes), parent specific activities (e.g., a yoga class), peer support sessions (e.g., small group discussions around issues such as weight stigmatization), and fitness classes (e.g., soccer classes).</description>
