      Several publications document the occurrence of symptoms that persist or occur late.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of the observed clinical manifestations and their clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical description are essential to better understand the natural evolution of&#xD;
      COVID-19, to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of these possible late manifestations,&#xD;
      and to identify potential management options for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this type of event is infrequent, a large-scale national multicenter cohort study&#xD;
      focusing on symptomatic patients is needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several publications document the occurrence of symptoms that persist or occur late, more&#xD;
      than 3 weeks after the first clinical manifestations of an SARS-COV2 infection. These&#xD;
      manifestations may be related to thromboembolic or inflammatory complications,&#xD;
      superinfections, or other mechanisms not yet well understood, including potentially related&#xD;
      to the persistence of SARS-COV2. The identification of the observed clinical manifestations&#xD;
      and their clinical and paraclinical description are essential to better understand the&#xD;
      natural evolution of COVID-19, to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of these possible&#xD;
      late manifestations, and to identify potential management options for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this type of event is infrequent, a large-scale national multicenter cohort study&#xD;
      focusing on symptomatic patients is needed. In parallel, the prevalence of the main symptoms&#xD;
      observed more than 3 weeks after the onset of a COVID-19 will be estimated through&#xD;
      partnerships with existing cohort studies in the general population or in the population&#xD;
      followed for COVID-19, still symptomatic or not at 3 weeks of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal implementation of bio-libraries will allow this cohort to also constitute a&#xD;
      bridge between clinicians and researchers.&#xD;
