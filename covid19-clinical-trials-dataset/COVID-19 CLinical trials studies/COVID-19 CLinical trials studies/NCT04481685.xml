  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 morbidity and mortality has been associated with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATI-450 is an oral small molecule MAPKAPK2 (MK2) inhibitor that potently inhibits multiple&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that MK2 pathway blockade during active COVID-19 infection in&#xD;
      hospitalized participants will result in improvement in respiratory-failure free survival.&#xD;
