      Tofacitinib suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling that may be important pathogenetically to&#xD;
      progression to more severe lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19. The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      tofacitinib plus standard pharmacologic and supportive measures in treating hospitalized&#xD;
      participants with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a viral disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that can cause severe pneumonia and ARDS. Respiratory viral load&#xD;
      may peak within 5 days after onset, while symptoms are still mild. Many patients rapidly&#xD;
      (within 1 to 2 weeks of infection) develop dyspnea and pneumonia and require hospitalization&#xD;
      for respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical data from COVID-19 patients indicate that severe symptoms with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with an exaggerated immune response driven by interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-6 IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)Î±, and other cytokines. The ultimate result is&#xD;
      progressive destruction of the alveolar epithelium leading to pneumonia and/or ARDS.&#xD;
      Moreover, the exudative phase of ARDS is thought to be due to an influx of myeloid cells&#xD;
      (neutrophils and macrophages) and elevations of inflammatory cytokines, with higher levels of&#xD;
      both IL-6 and IL-8 levels being correlated with increased mortality. Therefore,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in reducing the deleterious effects of lung&#xD;
      inflammation and mitigating progressive lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAKs) 1 and 3, with partial selectivity to JAK&#xD;
      2. Tofacitinib suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling that may be important pathogenetically&#xD;
      to progression to more severe lung disease and ARDS in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib plus standard&#xD;
      pharmacologic and supportive measures in treating hospitalized participants with COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a positive PCR&#xD;
      or other commercially available or public health assay, who have agreed to participate, will&#xD;
      be screened within 72h hours after admission to the hospital to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized on Day 1 to the tofacitinib plus standard of care&#xD;
      treatment group or the placebo plus standard of care treatment group in a 1:1 ratio,&#xD;
      stratified by site and need for oxygen Participants will receive treatment for up to 14 days&#xD;
      or until discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed daily (up to Day 28) while hospitalized for clinical, safety,&#xD;
      and laboratory parameters. Follow-up visits will occur on Day 14 and on Day 28.&#xD;
