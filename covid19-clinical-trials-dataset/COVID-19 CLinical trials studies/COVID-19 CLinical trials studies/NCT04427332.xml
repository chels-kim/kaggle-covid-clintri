    <textblock>
      This is a prospective monocentric observational study with the aim of investigating the&#xD;
      demographic and clinical factors related to the smell and taste disorders in patients with&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (Sars-Cov-2) infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary observational data collected by Otorhinolaryngologist at the San Gerardo Hospital&#xD;
      in Monza and by literature evidenced that numerous patients suffering from Sars-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection had smell and taste disorders. The are many data in the literature but few&#xD;
      validated studies are available. Furthermore, it is not yet known in these patients what&#xD;
      factors are related to the presence of olfactory and gustatory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to identify the demographic and clinical factors related to the smell&#xD;
      and taste disorders in patients with Sars-CoV-2 infection, to evaluate the evolution of&#xD;
      symptoms with a follow-up and to evaluate which factors influence the improvement of that&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients diagnosed with Sars-CoV-2 infection who have been&#xD;
      hospitalized in the COVID wards of the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza and non-hospitalized&#xD;
      patients but that get access to the &quot;nasopharyngeal swabs&quot; service of the hospital for the&#xD;
      detection of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 3 timepoints. After acquiring informed consent, patient will be contacted&#xD;
      on the phone and he will be asked to answer a multiple or short-answer questionnaire (T0)&#xD;
      aimed at collecting demographic and clinical data, in particular relating to the smell and&#xD;
      taste disorders, which will take place approximately 24 hours after running the swab.&#xD;
      Follow-up period will follow, which will require patients to be contacted and invited by the&#xD;
      Investigator to repeat the telephone questionnaire respectively 1 month (T1) and 3 months&#xD;
      (T2) from the first compilation (T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected and recorded on a paper CRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  registry collection (date of birth, gender at birth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  origin of the subjects: hospitalized, not hospitalized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pathological, pharmacological history, allergies, smoking, flu vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of onset of COVID19 symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smell and taste symptoms and temporal correlation with systemic symptoms (fever,&#xD;
           dyspnoea, headache, rhinitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgias, skin&#xD;
           manifestations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of regression of the smell and taste symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISCAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A logistic regression model is used to identify what the clinical and demographic factors&#xD;
      associated with the onset of the disease of interest are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composite endpoint consisting of the presence of smell and / or taste disorders vs the&#xD;
      absence of both pathologies will be used as a variable. The secondary analyzes will concern&#xD;
      only the subjects who have declared that they have had the disease in the study and, through&#xD;
      a logistic or ordinal regression model, we will try to identify which factors are associated&#xD;
      with the positive evolution of the disease at T3 compared to T0.&#xD;
