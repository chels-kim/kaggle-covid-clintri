  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall mortality of COVID-19 is variable and has been reported to be between less than 1%&#xD;
      and 7%. Many authors around the world also reported data on hospitalization rate, need for&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) care and need for mechanical ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 infected&#xD;
      patients. To provide anesthetic and surgical care to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, many&#xD;
      health workers have to organize surgical platforms, personal protections and in-hospital&#xD;
      trajectories to prevent dissemination and cross-contamination. However, no data has been&#xD;
      published on the surgical need of these patients, their postoperative outcomes and the impact&#xD;
      they may have on the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are completely unknown. Expected&#xD;
      benefits that justify a surgical procedure may be different in this population as well as the&#xD;
      effects of preoperative characteristics on postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical needs of these patients, their postoperative outcomes as well as the associated&#xD;
      workload imposed to operating rooms are unknown. There is a need to better quantify these and&#xD;
      inform needed surgical resources in a pandemic. To address this knowledge gap, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a multicenter observational cohort study in SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infected patients undergoing a surgical procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      METHODS Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To describe the observed surgical needs of COVID-19 patients in Canadian centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To measure the association between preoperative characteristics and postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary: To quantify the operating room workload and modified workflow associated with the&#xD;
      surgical care of COVID-19 patients as well as impact of a viral pneumonia pandemic on&#xD;
      surgical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the primary objective, the main variables of interest will be the surgical disease&#xD;
      that brought the patient to the operating room, its urgent nature and the invasiveness of the&#xD;
      surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the secondary objective, the investigators will gather baseline characteristics of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 presentation as the main exposure variables: presence of symptoms at time of&#xD;
      surgery, number of days since first symptoms, number of days since diagnosis, recovery,&#xD;
      presence of pulmonary infiltrates, preoperative hospitalization, preoperative need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (still in use or weaned), oxygen need at time of surgery and received&#xD;
      treatments (antiviral, steroids, antibiotics). The investigators will also gather other&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities, baseline laboratory values, preoperative&#xD;
      SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score and intraoperative variables (type of&#xD;
      anesthesia, type of intubation technique, blood loss, fluid balance, transfusions, duration&#xD;
      of surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the tertiary objective, the investigators will gather the type and number of&#xD;
      personal protective equipment used per case in the operating room, the required time for&#xD;
      operating room preparation and cleaning, patient extubation localization and patient disposal&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical care impact variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect from operating room administrative databases the number of&#xD;
      surgeries performed during the period of observation and the number of surgeries performed&#xD;
      during a comparative period of observation of the preceding year in all sites. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect the mean time from operating room entry to room exit and the&#xD;
      mean time from operating room exit to end of cleaning both in surgeries of the preceding year&#xD;
      and in surgeries of the period of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variable definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All COVID-19 variables will be based on either the day when symptoms start as reported by the&#xD;
      patient or the first day of diagnosis (either clinical or by RT-PCR from either an&#xD;
      oronasopharyngeal swab or an endotracheal specimen). The investigators will also capture&#xD;
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier. Recovery at surgery will be defined based on the latest&#xD;
      available definition of a healed patient as provided by health authorities. . Surgical&#xD;
      disease will be defined as the one reported by the surgeon. Surgeries will be further&#xD;
      categorized into the following categories: neurosurgical (head, neck and spine), cardiac,&#xD;
      thoracic, major vascular (intrathoracic and/or intra-abdominal), non-vascular abdominal&#xD;
      (laparotomy or laparoscopy), urogenital (urology and/or gynecology), non-spine orthopedics,&#xD;
      peripheral vascular, ENT and other. Any neurosurgical, cardiac, thoracic, major vascular or&#xD;
      non-vascular abdominal surgery will be defined as a major surgery. The investigators will&#xD;
      capture the surgical approach (minimally invasive or invasive) and the urgent nature of the&#xD;
      procedure. Minimally invasive surgery will be defined as a one that does not need to open an&#xD;
      anatomical cavity (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, endoluminal). Urgency of surgery will be&#xD;
      defined as one that needs to be done within 6 hours (emergent), between 6 and 24 hours&#xD;
      (urgent) and can wait for more than 24 hours (non-urgent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure survival up to 30 days after surgery and survival up to 6&#xD;
      months will also be captured. The investigators will use existing definitions for the&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications outcome. Non-pulmonary infectious complications will be&#xD;
      defined as any infection that needed antibiotics for more than 72 hours. Acute kidney injury&#xD;
      will be defined by the creatinine difference of the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Myocardial infraction&#xD;
      and stroke will be defined as reported by treating physicians. Mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      defined as any mechanical support (non-invasive or invasive). All 30-day outcomes will&#xD;
      include any day with the outcome and the 30-day organ dysfunction free days will use existing&#xD;
      definitions. Time of room cleaning will be defined from patient transfer out of the operating&#xD;
      room to end of cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan a convenient sample size depending on the number of patients and&#xD;
      center included. Inclusion will start on the 13th of March 2020. A formal statistical&#xD;
      analytic plan (SAP) will be proposed according to the power this cohort may provide. The SAP&#xD;
      will be published before any statistical analysis is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses of baseline characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed patients&#xD;
      (symptomatic and asymptomatic) will be conducted. The primary analysis will be a&#xD;
      determination multivariable model on survival of these patients up to 30 days after surgery.&#xD;
      A multivariable Cox model will include presence of symptoms, preoperative oxygen need and&#xD;
      urgency of surgery as independent variables and a frailty factor a center random effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary analyses will be descriptive analyses of suspected and healted patients and a&#xD;
      similar multivariable survival model on all patients included in this study (confirmed,&#xD;
      suspected or healed. Preoperative oxygen need, urgency of surgery and disease status&#xD;
      (confirmed, suspected or healed) will be included as independent variables in this analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the following outcomes will be reported descriptively: proportion of patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary complications, thromboembolic complications, non-pulmonary infectious&#xD;
      complications, need for a new postoperative ICU admission, mean hospital length of stay,&#xD;
      30-day mechanical ventilation free-days and 30-day organ dysfunction free days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number and types of surgeries on all patients during the observed period will be&#xD;
      reported. The number of surgeries performed during the year before and the mean time of room&#xD;
      usage and cleaning in all patients of both observation periods will also be reported.&#xD;
