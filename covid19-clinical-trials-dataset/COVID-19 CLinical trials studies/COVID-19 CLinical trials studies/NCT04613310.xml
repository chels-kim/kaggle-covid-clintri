      Recent literature shows that the sensitivity of the PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      using saliva samples is close to that using nasopharyngeal swabs. This type of sampling&#xD;
      represents a practical advantage since it can be performed by the patient herself/himself and&#xD;
      would thus allow to speed up the collection process. It is also less painful and could&#xD;
      prevent the rare lesions to the nasal mucosa that can occur when using nasopharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid Diagnostic Tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been developed using&#xD;
      nasophayngeal swabs and have shown very high sensitivity against PCR, ranging from 93% to 98%&#xD;
      when based on laboratory validation, 80% when based on clinical validation.This method offers&#xD;
      the considerable advantage to inform the patient of the test result on site, and allow the&#xD;
      provision of appropriate recommendations on the spot of testing. The studies performed so far&#xD;
      have been conducted using nasopharyngeal samples only. There are no data with saliva yet. It&#xD;
      is expected that the RDT would also work on the saliva. Even if slightly less sensitive due&#xD;
      to the fact that it detects antigens and not multiplied RNA as PCR does, RDT on saliva could&#xD;
      better serve the public health goal to test widely and quickly and have ultimately more COVID&#xD;
      cases detected and isolated, and hence reduced transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the case detection rates of both PCR on saliva and nasopharynx and RDT on&#xD;
      nasopharynx and saliva, the patient will be taken four samples, two swabs on saliva, one for&#xD;
      RDT and one for PCR, and two swabs on nasopharynx, one for RDT and one for PCR. Patients who&#xD;
      have at least one of the common symptoms and who consent to such a procedure will be&#xD;
      recruited to compare the four results. The primary objective is to compare the case detection&#xD;
      rates for SARS-CoV-2 of the four testing methods (two sampling types and two test types).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent literature shows that the sensitivity of the PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      using saliva samples is close to that using nasopharyngeal swabs. This type of sampling&#xD;
      represents a practical advantage since it can be performed by the patient herself/himself and&#xD;
      would thus allow to speed up the collection process. It is also less painful and could&#xD;
      prevent the rare lesions to the nasal mucosa that can occur when using nasopharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid Diagnostic Tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been developed using&#xD;
      nasophayngeal swabs and have shown very high sensitivity against PCR, ranging from 93% to 98%&#xD;
      when based on laboratory validation, 80% when based on clinical validation.This method offers&#xD;
      the considerable advantage to inform the patient of the test result on site, and allow the&#xD;
      provision of appropriate recommendations on the spot of testing. The studies performed so far&#xD;
      have been conducted using nasopharyngeal samples only. There are no data with saliva yet. It&#xD;
      is expected that the RDT would also work on the saliva. Even if slightly less sensitive due&#xD;

      cases detected and isolated, and hence reduced transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the case detection rates of both PCR on saliva and nasopharynx and RDT on&#xD;
      nasopharynx and saliva, patients will be taken four samples, two swabs on saliva, one for RDT&#xD;
      and one for PCR, and two swabs on nasopharynx, one for RDT and one for PCR. Patients who have&#xD;
      at least one of the common symptoms and who consent to such a procedure will be recruited to&#xD;
      compare the four results. The primary objective is to compare the case detection rates for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 of the four testing methods (two sampling types and two test types).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited consecutively. After&#xD;
      confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients will be asked whether they would&#xD;
      be willing to provide two saliva samples and one nasopharyngeal swab in addition to that&#xD;
      provided for routine testing. After written informed consent, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      perform swabbing of the gingiva-buccal fold two times and a saliva sample under professional&#xD;
      supervision, once for sending to the laboratory to perform PCR, and once for performing the&#xD;
      RDT onsite according to manufacturer's information. They will also be taken two&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs, one for RDT and one for PCR. No coughing or sniffing prior to sample&#xD;
      collection is required. Ideally, water should be avoided 10 minutes prior to collection.&#xD;
      Other drinks, food, and nasal sprays should be avoided 20 minutes before sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saliva and nasopharyngeal samples will be analysed by PCR according to the standard&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RDTs will be performed and results read according to the manufacturer information (see&#xD;
      below). Alternatively one of the three following tests will be tested: RDT from Roche&#xD;
      (Standard Q COVID-19, the RDT from Abbott (Panbio COVID-19 Ag) and the RDT from AAZ-LMB&#xD;
      (COVID-VIRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be considered as positive for SARS-CoV-2 if any of the test results (by RDT,&#xD;
      or PCR on saliva or nasopharynx) is positive.&#xD;
