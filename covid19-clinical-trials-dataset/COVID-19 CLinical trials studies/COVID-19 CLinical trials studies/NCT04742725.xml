      This is a Phase 2, proof of concept, two-arm, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Prothione™ capsules in subjects with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate symptoms caused by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive three Prothione™ capsules, or placebo orally administered twice daily&#xD;
      (BID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three phases: screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period.&#xD;
      Screening period is up to 3 days , the treatment period is 30 days and the follow-up period&#xD;
      is 7 days after the last dose.Total study duration is up to 40 days.&#xD;
