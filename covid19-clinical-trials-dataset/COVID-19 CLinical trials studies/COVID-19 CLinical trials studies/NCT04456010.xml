  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-urgent medical care, such as fertility treatments, has been massively postponed during&#xD;
      the past weeks due to the COVID19 pandemic. The lockdown and the closure of IVF centers might&#xD;
      cause anxiety and depression among infertile couples, who are already exposed to the&#xD;
      distressing experience of infertility and for whom the wait for a baby already appears&#xD;
      unending. Few data are available regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and&#xD;
      foetus, or on fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the views of infertile couple regarding the potential risks of&#xD;
      COVID during their fertility treatment and their personal experience of the COVID pandemic&#xD;
      and their expectation for further treatment .&#xD;
