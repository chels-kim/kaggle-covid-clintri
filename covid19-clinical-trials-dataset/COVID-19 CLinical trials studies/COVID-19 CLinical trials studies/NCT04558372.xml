  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic-nose had been used to diagnose other infectious lung diseases, such as&#xD;
      tuberculosis. Universitas Gadjah Mada has developed an electronic-nose device which is&#xD;
      easy-to-use, portable, and can be manufactured at a low price. Here the investigators test&#xD;
      the electronic-nose to diagnose COVID-19 in Indonesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The validation of device is conducted to 43 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 40 confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 negative patients from Bhayangkara Hospital, RSLKC Bambalipuro in Yogyakarta Special&#xD;
      Region, Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, patients with symptoms suggesting COVID-19 will be recruited using multicentre&#xD;
      consecutive sampling. The minimum number of participants required is 1460 subjects. The study&#xD;
      use a triple-blind design where the research subjects, breath sample takers, and sample&#xD;
      examiners did not know the results of each sampling that had been done. The final data&#xD;
      processor was also blinded to the results of nose and throat swabs. The breath sampling data&#xD;
      is saved in graphic form which interpretation will be carried out later by the data processor&#xD;
      at the final stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study population involve children and adults who come to the COVID-19 outpatient clinic&#xD;
      in each participating hospital with a diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infection. All patients&#xD;
      remain in the setting under medical service in accordance with the standard operating&#xD;
      procedure (SOP) and clinical practice guidelines (CPG) protocols for handling patients with&#xD;
      suspected COVID-19. The patients underwent nasal and oropharyngeal swabs according to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 outpatient CPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked about symptoms that they have, such as fever, fatigue, dry&#xD;
      cough, stuffy/ runny nose, sore throat, myalgia, shortness of breath, and diarrhea.&#xD;
      Afterwards, they will be asked to breathe normally using a mask for 2 times, then inhale and&#xD;
      exhale in a forced expiratory volume to an air collecting bag that later is connected to the&#xD;
      e-nose machine via a HEPA-filter. The performance of breath test will be compared with the&#xD;
      performance of symptoms with the reference of RT-PCR results. In addition, participants'&#xD;
      demographic and clinical data will be collected.&#xD;

The final data processor is also blinded to the results of nose and throat swabs.
