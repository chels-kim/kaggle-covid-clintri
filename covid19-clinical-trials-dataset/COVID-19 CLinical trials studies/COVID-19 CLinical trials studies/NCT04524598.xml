  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 3 million teenagers in the USA have depression, and rates of depression and suicide are&#xD;
      sharply increasing. Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in&#xD;
      academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and&#xD;
      worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental&#xD;
      health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many&#xD;
      teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical&#xD;
      and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit&#xD;
      access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to&#xD;
      develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental&#xD;
      health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This fully virtual study&#xD;
      (https://www.limbix.com/spark) will compare the relative safety, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      engagement of a mobile application based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral&#xD;
      activation (Limbix Spark), focusing on the idea that engaging in behaviors that are rewarding&#xD;
      or provide a sense of mastery can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. Limbix&#xD;
      Spark will be compared to a mobile app containing educational material about depression&#xD;
      (Psychoeducation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in adolescence is a public health crisis, with incidence and suicide rates rising&#xD;
      sharply over the past decade. The COVID-19 global pandemic, along with mandated social and&#xD;
      physical distancing, is expected to have substantial repercussions on public mental health&#xD;
      and exacerbate the mental health crisis among teens. Adolescents, a group with significant&#xD;
      unmet mental health needs, are at risk during this time, as they are especially vulnerable to&#xD;
      depression and suicidality following environmental stressors, trauma, and social isolation&#xD;
      that are endemic to this global pandemic. With difficulties in receiving in person care&#xD;
      magnified during social distancing, now more than ever, there is an immediate need for safe,&#xD;
      accessible, and effective digital treatments for mental health disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention is intended to increase access to mental health care during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)- based digital treatment for adolescent depression (Limbix&#xD;
      Spark) relative to psychoeducation. Limbix Spark implements behavioral activation (BA), a key&#xD;
      CBT skill that provides a sense of pleasure or mastery through self-monitored activities to&#xD;
      reduce depressive symptoms and improve functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents with depression (13-21 years old) across the country will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in a fully remote, clinical trial via https://www.limbix.com/spark. At an initial&#xD;
      virtual visit, following informed consent, adolescents and parents (for those under 18) will&#xD;
      fill out standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      general health. Participants will then download an app onto their mobile phone and be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive the Limbix Spark program and&#xD;
      the other will receive the Psychoeducation program for 5 weeks. The Limbix Spark program is&#xD;
      divided into 5 levels. Each level provides educational information about cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy and behavioral activation, and interactive activities including mood tracking and&#xD;
      activity scheduling. The Psychoeducation program is divided into 5 lessons. Each lesson&#xD;
      covers a different topic about depression. During both 5 week programs, patients will also&#xD;
      complete a weekly Patient Health Questionnaire, which is designed to measure depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and also will report any negative side effects they may be experiencing. After 5&#xD;
      weeks, participants and legal guardians (for those under 18) will complete another set of&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general&#xD;
      health. Patients will also complete questionnaires asking them about their thoughts and&#xD;
      experiences with the program they just completed. Lastly, a subset of patients and parents&#xD;
      will be invited to complete a virtual interview to provide feedback on using the program.&#xD;
