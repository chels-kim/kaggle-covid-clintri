      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. In most cases, COVID-19 is a mild&#xD;
      to moderate respiratory illness. But it can also be more severe and even lead to death. There&#xD;
      is no vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also no therapy to treat COVID-19.&#xD;
      Researchers want to collect plasma from adults who have recovered from COVID-19, which may&#xD;
      help them develop treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune plasma from adult volunteers who have recovered from&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females ages 18 to 70 who have a history of COVID-19 like illness or positive test&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2, and have a minimum level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as specified by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 2 parts: 1) screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and eligibility to&#xD;
      donate plasma and 2) plasma collection by apheresis. Study sites may participate in 1 part&#xD;
      alone (either screening or plasma collection only) or both parts (screening and plasma&#xD;
      collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening part: Participants will be screened for their eligibility to join this research&#xD;
      study with a medical history and physical exam. Their vital signs (blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, temperature, respiration rate) will be taken. Their weight and height will be recorded.&#xD;
      They will give a blood sample for clinical laboratory tests of their general health and a&#xD;
      research test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They will discuss their history of COVID-19-like&#xD;
      illness and any testing for SARS-CoV-2. They will be evaluated for their ability to donate&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For plasma collection part: Subjects meeting criteria for plasma donation and found to have&#xD;
      high neutralizing antibody titers and who plan to donate plasma under this part of the study&#xD;
      will be scheduled for 1 (and up to 20) plasma collection sessions. These will occur no less&#xD;
      than 7 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each donation, participants will have a brief physical exam and complete a donor&#xD;
      history questionnaire. They will be asked about any current SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each donation, plasma will be taken through a standard apheresis procedure. For this,&#xD;
      blood will be withdrawn through a needle placed in the participant's arm vein. A machine will&#xD;
      separate the plasma from the red cells. The red cells will be returned to the participant,&#xD;
      either through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation may last up to 240 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus&#xD;
      named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The objective of this protocol is the identification&#xD;
      of eligible donors and collection of anti-SARSCoV-2 immune plasma from convalescent survivors&#xD;
      of COVID-19 illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and&#xD;
      their blood measured for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline&#xD;
      physical and laboratory examination. Subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titers who meet standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for&#xD;
      plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential&#xD;
      pathogens, this plasma may be used and/or converted into an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)&#xD;
      preparation for further study.&#xD;
