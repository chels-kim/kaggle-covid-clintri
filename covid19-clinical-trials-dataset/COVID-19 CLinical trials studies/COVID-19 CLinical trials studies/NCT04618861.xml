    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide some insight into the variation of SD-D protein levels in patients&#xD;
      with Covid-19 (-) pneumonia, Covid-19 (+) pneumonia, and CT negative Covid-19 infection in&#xD;
      comparison to the normal population through a larger number of cases. Objective of the study&#xD;
      is to determine the serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) levels in Covid-19 pneumonia infection.&#xD;

      This study aims to provide some insight into the variation of SD-D protein levels in patients&#xD;
      with Covid-19 (-) pneumonia, Covid-19 (+) pneumonia, and CT negative Covid-19 infection in&#xD;
      comparison to the normal population through a larger number of cases. Subjects will assessed&#xD;
      in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were divided into four groups&#xD;
      as the CT (-), PCR (+) SARS-CoV-2 infection group, SARS-CoV-2 (+) Pneumonia Group, CT (+),&#xD;
      PCR (-) Suspected Pneumonia Group and Healthy group (Control Group). Demographic data,&#xD;
      medical history, vital findings (fever, blood pressure, sPO2), laboratory findings (complete&#xD;
      blood count; C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, Ferritin and hsTnT parameters) and&#xD;
      radiological findings, time to onset of symptoms, Comorbid diseases, hospitalization location&#xD;
      of the patients (service or ICU), clinical scores, CT severity scores will determine. SP-D&#xD;
      level will analyze by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method.&#xD;

    <description>This cohort involved the volunteers who had no known acute, subacute or chronic disease history, who did not suffer from any infection in the last fortnight, who were not on a particular medication, who presented to the ED with reasons other than infectious complaints, and who gave their written consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
The exclusion criteria consisted of diagnosis of kidney and liver failure, acute pulmonary embolism, chronic inflammatory disease history (rheumatological disease, autoimmune disease), pregnancy, presence of any cancer diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma disease, and history of cerebrovascular disease. In addition, the patients whose CT imagings were compatible with Covid-19 pneumonia but whose PCR tests were negative were also excluded from the study.</description>

    <description>This group consisted of patients who applied to the emergency department with symptoms of Covid-19, whose thorax CT according to RSNAEC criteria showed typical Covid-19 pneumonia findings, but whose RT-PCR test was negative in the swab sample taken in the emergency room.&#xD;
The exclusion criteria consisted of diagnosis of kidney and liver failure, acute pulmonary embolism, chronic inflammatory disease history (rheumatological disease, autoimmune disease), pregnancy, presence of any cancer diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma disease, and history of cerebrovascular disease.

        After the required information concerning the study was provided both to the patient group&#xD;
        and to the healthy control group, the written consent forms were obtained from all the&#xD;
        subjects who agreed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Once these subjects were assessed in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
        Patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 infection according to WHO guideline as a result&#xD;
        of clinical evaluation in the emergency department and whose diagnosis was confirmed by&#xD;
        RT-PCR were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The healthy volunteers with no known chronic or acute disease or drug use as well as no&#xD;
        recent history of infection were included study as the control group. Once these subjects&#xD;
        were assessed in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were divided&#xD;
        into four groups as the CT (-), PCR (+) SARS-CoV-2 infection group, Covid-19 (+) Pneumonia&#xD;
        Group, CT (+), PCR (-) Suspected Pneumonia Group and Healthy group (Control Group).&#xD;
