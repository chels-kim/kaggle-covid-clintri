    <textblock>
      The International Registry of Healthcare Workers Exposed to COVID-19 Patients (UNITY Global),&#xD;
      is an international registry of approximately 10,000 healthcare workers in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries experiencing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases and commensurate&#xD;
      increased exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus among their healthcare worker populations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry will enrol HCWs who are experiencing or are expected to experience ongoing and&#xD;
      recurrent close contact with confirmed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients. Recruitment&#xD;
      for the registry will aim to enrol a representative distribution of HCWs on the front lines&#xD;
      of diagnosing and caring for COVID-19 patients in both hospitals and community settings, as&#xD;
      well as a balanced sample of HCWs receiving the most commonly administered putatively&#xD;
      prophylactic drug regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will collect information on a weekly basis from HCWs across a 12-week period&#xD;
      following their first known exposure to confirmed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      prior to or within 30 days after enrollment. Data collection will include the drug regimens&#xD;
      being taken by the HCWs, information about their level of exposure to COVID-19 patients,&#xD;
      their personal health status, and other factors such as the use of PPE which would likely&#xD;
      impact their risk of developing a SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard pharmaco-epidemiological inferential analysis will be conducted treating the&#xD;
      registry data as a cohort with dynamic exposure to both prophylactic treatment and to&#xD;
      COVID-19 infected patients and adjusting for potential confounding. Crude and adjusted&#xD;
      hazards ratios will be estimated for each of the prophylactic regimens of interest and any&#xD;
      observed impact on the risk of infection among HCWs based on all statistical inferential&#xD;
      models will be reported&#xD;

    <description>This is a comparative observational cohort study; therefore, no preventive interventions, visits or laboratory tests are mandated. Dosing and duration of potential prophylactic treatment is at the discretion of the institution and/or healthcare provider, in accordance with regular local practice. However, serology testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be offered to the first 50% of participating HCWs per country, at enrollment and at the last follow-up (i.e. at Week 12)</description>
