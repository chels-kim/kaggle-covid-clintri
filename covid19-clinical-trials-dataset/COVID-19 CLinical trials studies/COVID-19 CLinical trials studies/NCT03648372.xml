  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TAK-981 as&#xD;
      a single agent in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas in&#xD;
      Phase 1, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of TAK-981 in participants with select solid tumors&#xD;
      or relapsed/refractory CD20-positive (CD20+) non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) indications in Phase&#xD;
      2, and to assess change in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      viral load within 8 days of TAK-981 administration in COVID-19 Expansion.&#xD;

      01-Oct-2020 Enrollment of participants into the COVID arm of this study is no longer&#xD;
      recruiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and PK in participants with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors or relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies and in a subset with COVID-19.&#xD;
      The study will include 2 phases: Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 dose expansion cohorts&#xD;
      (cancer treatment expansions and COVID-19 expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 242 participants, approximately 50 participants in the&#xD;
      dose escalation phase, approximately 132 participants in cancer treatment expansion phase and&#xD;
      approximately 60 participants in the COVID-19 expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation, dose levels will be escalated based on safety, and available PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic data and will also determine the single agent RP2D. Participants in dose&#xD;
      expansion phase will be enrolled, once RP2D is determined. There will be 6 cohorts in cancer&#xD;
      treatment expansions as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: Nonsquamous NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: Cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: MSS-CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort D: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL progressed or relapsed after CAR T-cells therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort E: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL that have not received prior therapy with CAR&#xD;
           T-cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort F: Relapsed/refractory FL&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the COVID-19 expansion, dose schedule can be modified in safety lead-in if PK,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, decrease in viral load and safety data are supportive. Once the safety&#xD;
      lead-in is complete and a TAK-981 dose and regimen is selected, randomized COVID-19 proof of&#xD;
      concept will begin with participants randomized to Arm A: COVID-19 standard of care (SOC), or&#xD;
      Arm B: COVID-19 SOC + TAK-981.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time&#xD;
      to participate in this study is approximately 4 years. The overall time to receive treatment&#xD;
      in the dose escalation and cancer treatment is approximately 1 year and in COVID-19&#xD;
      expansion, participants will receive 1 cycle of treatment and will be followed for up to 90&#xD;
      days from enrollment. Based on decision of sponsor, participants with demonstrated clinical&#xD;
      benefit can continue treatment beyond 1 year. Participants will make multiple visits to the&#xD;
      clinic, and will make a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of drug or before&#xD;
      the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Covid-19 safety lead-in: TAK-981, intravenously, administered as 60 minute-infusion, once on Days 1 and 4. The starting dose of TAK-981 will be 60 milligram (mg). The initial dosing schedule for COVID-19 expansion cohorts will be for a single cycle with TAK-981 administered on Days 1 and 4. If PK, pharmacodynamics, decrease in viral load and safety data are supportive, the schedule can be modified in safety lead-in. A ramp-up schedule of TAK-981, intravenously, administered as 60 minute-infusion, 40 mg on Day 1 and 60 mg on Day 4 may be evaluated. COVID-19 proof of concept: Once the safety lead-in is complete and a TAK-981 dose and regimen is selected by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), the randomized COVID-19 proof of concept will begin with participants randomized to Arm A: COVID-19 standard of care (SOC), or Arm B: COVID-19 SOC + TAK-981.</description>

               -  Has relapsed/refractory lymphoma not amenable to therapies with proven clinical&#xD;
                  benefit or who are intolerant or who refuse them. Participants with low-grade&#xD;
                  lymphomas such as FL, small lymphocytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma,&#xD;
                  and marginal zone lymphomas, may not need to exhaust all available therapy. These&#xD;
                  participants can be enrolled after failure of at least 2 prior systemic&#xD;
                  therapies, provided that there is not an immediate need for cytoreduction. In&#xD;
                  these cases, participants who need immediate therapy for tumor bulk are not&#xD;
                  eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Population for Phase 2 dose expansion cohorts:&#xD;

             unresectable) cancer as listed below, that is incurable and for which prior standard&#xD;
             first-line treatment has failed: Note: Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy included&#xD;
             in initial treatment may not be considered first- or later-line SOC treatment unless&#xD;
             such treatments were completed less than 12 months before the current tumor&#xD;
             recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Nonsquamous NSCLC that has progressed to 1 prior systemic immune checkpoint&#xD;

             therapy. Participants must have not shown evidence of tumor progression during the&#xD;
             first 5 months of treatment with first-line CPI/anti-PD-(1/L1)-containing therapy&#xD;
             (cohort A).&#xD;

             growth factor receptor [EGFR], B-Raf proto-oncogene mutation V600E [BRAF V600E], and&#xD;
             ROS proto-oncogene 1 [ROS1] sensitizing mutations, neurotrophic receptor tyrosine&#xD;
             kinase [NRTK] gene fusions, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] rearrangements) must&#xD;

             adenocarcinoma of the cervix) participants who have received no more than 1 prior&#xD;
             systemic line of therapy for recurrent or Stage IVB cervical cancer (cohort B).&#xD;

             malignum, gastric-type adenocarcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, and mesonephric&#xD;
             carcinoma. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via&#xD;
             pathology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: First-line treatment must have consisted of platinum-containing doublet.&#xD;
             Chemotherapy administered concurrently with primary radiation (example- weekly&#xD;
             cisplatin) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;

                  more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy and has not received prior cellular&#xD;
                  therapy. At least one prior line of therapy must have included a CD20-targeted&#xD;
                  therapy (cohort E).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed/refractory FL that has progressed or relapsed after at least 2 but no&#xD;
                  more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. At least 1 prior line of therapy&#xD;
                  must have included a CD20-targeted therapy (cohort F).&#xD;

             been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: In Phase 2 stage 1, have an additional lesion for pretreatment and on-treatment&#xD;
