  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world causing widespread panic, death, and injury.&#xD;
      While this virus is the provocateur, it is often the patient's own disproportionate immune&#xD;
      response which deals the most devastating (and often fatal) damage. A specific part of the&#xD;
      immune system, known as the complement, has been shown to cause such damage in other types of&#xD;
      coronaviruses. In the SOLID-C19 study, Soliris (Eculizumab) will be used to modulate the&#xD;
      activity of the distal complement preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex. By&#xD;
      modulating this portion of the immune response, mortality can be halted while the patient has&#xD;
      time to recover from the virus with supportive medical care.&#xD;

      Recorded Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time in the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time on a ventilator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Emergency FDA IND must be submitted (FDA form 3926) for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to approval the primary investigator will obtain an authorization letter from&#xD;
      Alexion Pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to dosing the patient must receive ceftriaxone IV and this must be continued during the&#xD;
      entire duration of therapy (vaccination will be mentioned shortly and is the only exception&#xD;
      to prophylactic antibiotic coverage). If there is a clinical reason why the patient cannot&#xD;
      receive Ceftriaxone (allergy, supply, etc) then an alternative prophylactic antibiotic&#xD;
      covering Neisseria meningitis must be given for the duration of therapy. The SeroB and&#xD;
      Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines can be given if the duration of antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      becomes unsafe or unfeasible. In that case, antibiotic therapy should be withdrawn no sooner&#xD;
      than 2 weeks after vaccination with both meningococcal vaccines (see ACIP guidelines in&#xD;
      complement deficient patients). It is preferred that vaccination is avoided while the patient&#xD;
      is acutely ill and that prophylactic antibiotics are used as meningococcal vaccination can&#xD;
      upregulate the immune system possibly worsening the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard dosing protocol - Eculizumab 900mg IV every 7 days. Eculizumab is given IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes without the need of a pump (although one can be used if available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental doses of eculizumab can be given if clinically warranted at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator and clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team should perform Murray scores daily for the first 72 hours THEN every other day&#xD;
      unless a change is deemed necessary by the attending physician. (table 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complement blood levels should be drawn every 72 hours. They may be drawn sooner if there is&#xD;
      clinical inquiry which would affect clinical decision making and/or after a dose of&#xD;
      Eculizumab is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of therapy is at the discretion of the clinical team and investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up at day 7, 14, and 28 after discharge.&#xD;
