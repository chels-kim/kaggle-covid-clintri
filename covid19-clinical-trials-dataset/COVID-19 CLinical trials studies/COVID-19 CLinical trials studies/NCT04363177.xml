  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health disorders are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period, and can have&#xD;
      serious adverse effects on the well-being of woman and child. Every tenth woman has&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and 5% suffer major depression during pregnancy. The consequences for&#xD;
      global mental health due to the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, are likely to be&#xD;
      significant and may have long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Pregnant women may&#xD;
      be particularly vulnerable due to partial immune suppression. Besides physical vulnerability,&#xD;
      the women could be at increased risk of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to social distancing leading to less support&#xD;
      from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present&#xD;
      during prenatal visits, labor and delivery. Furthermore, many pregnant women may feel&#xD;
      insecure and worried about the effect of COVID-19 on their unborn child, if the women get&#xD;
      infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to utilizing internet services&#xD;
      frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via&#xD;
      web-based support may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression and reduce the&#xD;
      risk of serious mental health disorders leading to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a period of transition and great change, which may make some women more&#xD;
      vulnerable to mental health problems. It is known that depressive symptoms during pregnancy&#xD;
      may influence birth outcomes. Perinatal mental health disorders may become more prevalent&#xD;
      during a time of acute crisis, and the prevalence of maternal anxiety, distress, and&#xD;
      perinatal depression can be expected to increase globally, as a result of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. However, there might be cross-national differences in the risk factors and impact&#xD;
      of pandemic on the prevalence of perinatal mental health disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some pregnant women might be predisposed to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during a&#xD;
      crisis situation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Mothers who developed PTSD in response to&#xD;
      the 9/11 terrorist attacks had lower morning and evening salivary cortisol levels, compared&#xD;
      to mothers who did not develop PTSD. Beyond effects on the mother alone, perinatal mental&#xD;
      health issues can have long-term effects on childÂ´s mental and physical health, as well as&#xD;
      the participants behavior and cognition. Distress in pregnant women may affect the fetus and&#xD;
      is known to induce epigenetic changes in the placental genes. Increased risk of&#xD;
      psychopathology is observed in children exposed to maternal prenatal distress. Elevated&#xD;
      maternal cortisol and epigenetic regulation of placental glucocorticoid-pathway genes are&#xD;
      potential mechanisms for these observations. Women often express feelings of inadequacy in&#xD;
      the new mothering role, which can furthermore negatively impact the participants mental&#xD;
      health and the relationship to the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective treatments are needed to address high global rates of postpartum depression (PPD)&#xD;
      with onset typically within 4 weeks after delivery and maternal depression up to two years&#xD;
      after delivery. Programs aimed at reducing PPD could achieve the most cost-efficient results&#xD;
      by focusing efforts in the critical time periods around childbirth. Web-based psychosocial&#xD;
      support provided by trained public health nurses is an effective treatment method for PPD.&#xD;
      Limited public health resources are challenges to the accessibility of mental health&#xD;
      services, which is why the use of web-based psychosocial support could be a good alternative.&#xD;
      Women perceive the risk for themselves or their infants to be above average during global&#xD;
      crises, which increases the levels of uncertainty. However, face-to-face consultations during&#xD;
      a pandemic are likely to increase the risk of disease transmission. Therefore, easily&#xD;
      accessible eHealth support could provide fast and resource-effective care during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will generate evidence on whether web-based early intervention programs could be&#xD;
      efficient in ameliorating the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders, and&#xD;
      inform best clinical practice for women affected by the consequences of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
