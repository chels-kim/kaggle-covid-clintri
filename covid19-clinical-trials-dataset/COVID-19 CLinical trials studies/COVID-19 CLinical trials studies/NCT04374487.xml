  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has&#xD;
      been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), Caused by the severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 has resulted in 1,781,127&#xD;
      cases and 108,994 deaths globally (till 12th April, 2020), affecting 199 countries and 2&#xD;
      international conveyances. US FDA has recently approved Convalescent Plasma from patients&#xD;
      recovered from COVID 19 for the treatment of severe or life threatening COVID-19 infections.&#xD;
      In a small case series, five critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS were treated with&#xD;
      convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies. Infusion of plasma was followed by&#xD;
      improvement in clinical status in all five patients, with no deaths and the study reported&#xD;
      that three patients were discharged, whilst two continued to be stable on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. We designed this phase II, open label, randomized clinical trial with the&#xD;
      primary objective to assess the safety and efficacy of the therapy in the second stage.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted over the period of one year on 100 Hospitalized, COVID-19&#xD;
      patients, fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and are admitted for care at COVID-19&#xD;
      management facilities in Max healthcare Hospital will be eligible for inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
      This Phase II, open label, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion-exclusion criteria and providing informed consent will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      test and the control group using random numbers generated by randomization.com. Patients in&#xD;
      the test group will receive convalescent plasma and the control group will be on standard&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma will be collected from recovered individuals if they are&#xD;
      eligible to donate blood. For infusion of plasma existing SOP of the wards w.r.t transfusion&#xD;
      of FFP should be followed with special care to monitor these patients during and post-24&#xD;
      hours of transfusion. An ABO compatible plasma bag of approx. 200ml will be issued&#xD;
      maintaining all the blood bank records after thawing at 37 degree Celsius. The first plasma&#xD;
      transfusion may be followed by one or two additional doses of 200 ml at 24 hours interval&#xD;
      according to disease severity and tolerance of the infusions. Baseline data about the&#xD;
      demography, clinical presentations, ongoing medical therapy, and clinical history of&#xD;
      participants in both arms will be collected and compared. Response to convalescent plasma&#xD;
      will be coded as a binary outcome - based on whether the composite primary end point is met&#xD;
      or not. Adverse events associated with infusion of convalescent plasma will also be&#xD;
      descriptively summarized and compared with the adverse events experienced by participants&#xD;
      receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility of Potential Donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Only males and nulliparous female donors of weight &gt; 55 kgs will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Donor eligibility criteria for whole blood donation as per the departmental SOP will be&#xD;
           followed in accordance to the Drugs &amp; Cosmetics Act 1940 and rules 1945 therein (as&#xD;
           amended till March 2020). Donor will be screened, followed by brief physical&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Donors not fit to donate blood based on the history and examination will be deferred and&#xD;
           excluded from plasma donor pool for a time period specified by country regulation &amp;&#xD;
           departmental SOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In addition to the aforementioned donor eligibility criteria, two EDTA samples (5 ml&#xD;
           each) and one plain sample (5 ml) will be drawn for the following pre-donation tests as&#xD;
           required for convalescent plasmapheresis (CPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood group and antibody screening - Antibody screen positive donors will be&#xD;
                deferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete blood count including Hb, Hct, Platelet count, Total and differential&#xD;
                leucocyte count. Donors with Hb&gt;12.5g/dl, platelet count &gt;1, 50,000 per microliter&#xD;
                of blood and TLC within normal limits will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening for HIV, HBV and HCV by serology and NAT. Donor negative by both the&#xD;
                tests will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening for syphilis and malaria by serology. Negative donors will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total serum protein. Donors with total serum protein &gt; 6gm/dl will be accepted (as&#xD;
                per Drugs and Cosmetics (Second Amendment) Rules, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Titration of anti-COVID-19 (both IgG and IgM) antibodies and SARS- CoV-2&#xD;
                neutralizing antibodies may be done depending on availability of facilities at the&#xD;
                time of testing. (Desired titers for IgG antibodies &gt;1024 or neutralizing&#xD;
                antibodies &gt;40) doubling dilution of donor serum will be done and titration will be&#xD;
                done using ELISA. If not done at the time of plasma collection the donor samples&#xD;
                will be stored in aliquots at &lt;-80° C to be tested at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Molecular test for COVID-19 either from nasopharyngeal swab specimens or blood may&#xD;
                be done depending on availability of tests. Donors positive will be deferred.&#xD;
