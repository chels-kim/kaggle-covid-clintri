      Randomized open-label multicenter parallel-group study of efficacy and safety of TL-FVP-t vs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 3 study of TL-FVP-t in&#xD;
      outpatients and inpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. After stratification by the&#xD;
      severity of their disease (mild or moderate), age (18-44 or ≥ 45 years) and CT severity&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized at a rate of 2:1 to receive either TL-FVP-t + standard&#xD;
      concomitant therapy or standard ethiptropic therapy (standard of care - SOC) including&#xD;
      standard concomitant therapy. Standard ethiptropic therapy according to MoH of Russian&#xD;
      Federation includes umifenovir + intranasal recombinant interferon alpha, hydroxichloroquine,&#xD;
      or chloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose regimen will be the following: TL-FVP-t at a dose of 1800 mg BID on the Day 1&#xD;
      followed by 800 mg BID during the next 9 days. The study will include the period of therapy&#xD;
      (10 days) and follow-up period (18 days).&#xD;
