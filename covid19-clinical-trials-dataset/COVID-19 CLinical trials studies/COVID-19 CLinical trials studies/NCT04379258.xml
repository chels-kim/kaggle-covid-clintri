    <textblock>
      The recent pandemic of the COVID-19 disease has caused a national health emergency due to its&#xD;
      severity and the clinical and social consequences of the disease. Crude mortality in Spain is&#xD;
      9.2%. However, the causes of death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are unknown. To&#xD;
      date, no treatment has been shown to be effective for the 2019-SARS-CoV-2 infection is&#xD;
      recommended. Supportive care and isolation are recommended for infected individuals.&#xD;
      Currently, observational studies on critically ill patients with COVID-19 have small samples.&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate the incidence of mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 disease in&#xD;
      this group of critically ill patients, as well as the risk factors associated with mortality&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of the treatments used compassionately.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      disease as an international alarm public health emergency. This ongoing pandemic of COVID-19&#xD;
      disease is devastating, despite widespread implementation of control measures, which is&#xD;
      creating a challenge for national healthcare. Since the beginning of the epidemic until the&#xD;
      date of this project, more than 800,000 cases have been detected in the world, of which&#xD;
      almost 214,000 have been detected in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the recent analysis of clinical characteristics in a selected cohort of 1,099&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients throughout China have shown that up to 15% (173 / 1,099) developed severe&#xD;
      disease according to the American Thoracic clinical criteria for severe community pneumonia.&#xD;
      Society, and of these seriously ill patients, 20.6% presented as admission to Intensive Care&#xD;
      Units (ICU) (33/173, 19%), or the use of mechanical ventilation, both invasive and&#xD;
      non-invasive. invasive (81/173, 46%) or death (14/173, 8%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective study that included 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to&#xD;
      the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from the Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), a 28-day&#xD;
      mortality rate of 61% was found, although the causes of death of the patients included were&#xD;
      not reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowaday, the crude mortality in Europe is 5.4% of reported cases, although it is important to&#xD;
      be noted that this calculation is subject to multiple notification biases and due to the&#xD;
      different diagnostic test policies in the countries, and probable differences in healthcare&#xD;
      and demographic models between countries. Similarly, in Spain, mortality with 213,024 cases&#xD;
      notified to the National Surveillance Network is 10.4%. Using modeling, a mortality has been&#xD;
      estimated among hospitalized cases that could reach 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9%&#xD;
      -32%). However, the mortality and causes of death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in&#xD;
      Spain are still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no specific antiviral treatment that has been shown to be effective for the&#xD;
      2019-SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended. Symptomatic and supportive care, along with&#xD;
      respiratory and contact isolation, are recommended for infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) is a prophylactic treatment for critically ill&#xD;
      patients, mainly requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, based on an oropharyngeal paste&#xD;
      and an enteral suspension containing antimicrobials (usually tobramycin, colistin, and an&#xD;
      antifungal) and an intravenous antibiotic (usually a cephalosporin. second generation),&#xD;
      administered during the first 4 days of ICU treatment. The goal of SDD is to prevent or&#xD;
      eradicate, if present, the abnormal, oropharyngeal and intestinal transport of potentially&#xD;
      pathogenic microorganisms, such as aerobic gram-negative bacilli (AGNB),&#xD;
      methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, in patients at risk of nosocomial infections. In&#xD;
      critically ill patients, it has been demonstrated with a high level of evidence, that SDD&#xD;
      prevents serious infections and reduces mortality. In an observational study in two hospitals&#xD;
      in China, 51% of the patients developed a hospital-acquired infection and this incidence was&#xD;
      associated with an increase in mortality. Therefore, the preventive strategy of SDD could be&#xD;
      postulated as an alternative to reduce mortality and the incidence of infections in&#xD;
      critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, this hypothesis has not been evaluated at the&#xD;
      moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, observational studies focused on the clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the factors associated with their mortality have&#xD;
      small sample sizes, making knowledge of the epidemiology of critically ill patients clearly&#xD;
      insufficient. And what is more relevant, this scenario of lack of knowledge, when&#xD;
      extrapolated to the situation of the current outbreak in Spain, places us in the need to&#xD;
      describe the epidemiological manifestations of the COVI-19 in Spain in order to handle with&#xD;
      safety and efficiency the challenge of the control and treatment of the outbreak in Spain of&#xD;
      the COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study will focus on critically ill patients with COVID-19 for two reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They represent the cohort of patients with the highest use of material and professional&#xD;
      resources in the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current moment of pandemic and healthcare challenge, it is therefore pertinent to&#xD;
      conduct an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 disease to reliably define the incidence&#xD;
      of mortality and morbidity in this group of patients, as well as the risk factors for&#xD;
      infection by SARS-CoV-2 associated with mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The main objective is to evaluate the mortality of critically ill patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, as well as to analyze the factors associated with mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of critically ill patients with confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the usual clinical practice in the ICU of critically ill adult patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19, to identify risk patterns and possible effectiveness or adverse effects of the&#xD;
      treatments received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with SDD compared&#xD;
      with those who do not received SDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the cause of death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 received invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Design: An observational, prospective and multicenter study will be carry out,&#xD;
      envolving of 12 ICUs in Madrid (University Hospital of Getafe, as coordinating center;&#xD;
      University Hospital Puerta de Hierro, University Hospital del Henares of Coslada, University&#xD;
      Hospital of Torrejón, Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Hospital Infanta Cristina,&#xD;
      Hospital del Tajo, Hospital Quirón Madrid Sanchinarro, Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa,&#xD;
      Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Hospital Universitario de Móstoles, Hospital&#xD;
      Universitario La Princesa, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Hospital Universitario Doce de&#xD;
      Octubre, and Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona). Inclusion criteria: patients over&#xD;
      18 years of age who are admitted to the ICU with the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period: The study will start once the study has been approved by the Ethics and&#xD;
      Research Committee of the Hospital Universitario de Getafe with an expected date of April&#xD;
      2020, with an estimated duration of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case definition: Any critically ill patients with a positive respiratory tract sample result&#xD;
      (tracheal aspirate or nasopharyngeal exudate) using the PCR technique for the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      virus and requiring admission to the ICU at trial will be considered a confirmed case of&#xD;
      COVID-19 of the physician in charge of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Demographic variables: age, sex, reason for admission to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidities: severity at ICU admission (SAPSIII); Daily SOFA until day 7, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other chronic lung&#xD;
      diseases (interstitial lung disease), chronic kidney failure, previous liver disease&#xD;
      (cirrhosis), immunosuppression, previous heart disease (ischemic, valvular), chronic&#xD;
      arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation); previous cerebrovascular disease (ischemic or&#xD;
      hemorrhagic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive respiratory support prior to ICU admission: non-invasive ventilation, or high&#xD;
      flow therapy with nasal cannula, and duration of non-invasive respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive respiratory support parameters during the first 7 days: tidal volume, level of&#xD;
      positive end-expiratory pressure, plateau pressure, inspiratory fraction of oxygen.&#xD;
      Biochemistry values and arterial blood gases, blood count and coagulation parameters on&#xD;
      admission to the ICU during the first 7 days from ICU admission. Pharmacological therapies&#xD;
      received for COVID-19 disease during the ICU stay: azitromycin, corticosteroids,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, antiretrovirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), tocilizumab, oseltamivir,&#xD;
      darunabir, remdesivir, baricitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial / fungal infections acquired in the ICU (pneumonia, bacteriemia): isolated&#xD;
      microorganisms in diagnostic samples, isolated microorganisms in surveillance samples&#xD;
      (oropharynx and rectum if surveillance samples are available); antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilatory management: prone positioning, administration of inhaled nitric oxide,&#xD;
      performance of tracheostomy, date of tracheotomy, modality of tracheotomy (surgical,&#xD;
      percutaneous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of predefined causes of death:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry less than 80%,&#xD;
      or PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg of arterial blood sample) despite maximum ventilatory support (FiO2 100%,&#xD;
      PEEP level&gt; 5 cm H2O) with maintenance MAP&gt; 60 mmHg in the 3 hours prior to exitus lethalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory shock (mean arterial pressure less than 60 mmHg despite vasoactive support with&#xD;
      norepinephrine at&gt; 2 mcg / kg / min and / or dobutamine at&gt; 20 microgr / kg / min, and serum&#xD;
      lactate level&gt; 2 mmol / L in the 3 hours prior to exitus lethalis), associated or not with&#xD;
      organ failure, but with peripheral oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry greater than&#xD;
      90%, with no evidence of documented infection in the previous 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic shock. A refractory shock which fulfill previous criteria plus the presence of a&#xD;
      documented infection in the 48 hours prior to exitus lethalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others: Pulmonary thromboembolism (defined based on clinical suspicion, associated with any&#xD;
      of the classifications [Wells or Geneva] according to the low, intermediate or high&#xD;
      probability and the determination of the high D-dimer (&gt; 500 μg/L) in the 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      exitus lethalis; Incohercible bleeding; Yatrogenic respiratory complications (accidental exit&#xD;
      of the orotracheal tube with impossibility of obtaining an artificial airway, fatal&#xD;
      obstruction of the orotracheal tube); Arrhythmias: sudden unanticipated onset of malignant&#xD;
      arrhythmias (irreversible ventricular fibrillation), or asystole. Arrhythmias appearing&#xD;
      during the last minutes before exitus lethalis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes. ICU mortality, 28-day mortality, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
      appearance of nosocomial infections during ICU admission (ventilator-associated pneumonia ,&#xD;
      nosocomial pneumonia, catheter-related bacteremia, bacteraemia); development of complications&#xD;
      during ICU admission (development of acute respiratory distress, barotrauma, development of&#xD;
      organ failure [cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, hematological]), duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, withdrawald of life support, and&#xD;
      cause of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis. Given the estimated mortality of 40% of the cases hospitalized in the&#xD;
      ICU, a convenience sample size of 600 participants will be estimated. Considering a loss of&#xD;
      15% for the outcomes, 750 subjects will finally be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the risk factors associated with the mortality of critically ill patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19, a logistic model adjusted for baseline variables (age, severity at ICU admission),&#xD;
      empirical treatment received, failure of non-invasive respiratory support will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of empirical treatments for COVID-19 will be performed through logistic&#xD;
      analysis adjusted for age, severity at admission and complications during ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a stratified cluster analysis will be proposed for ICUs that apply the SDD&#xD;
      strategy and units that do not routinely use SDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality. The data will be reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee of the study&#xD;
      and validated by the collaborating researcher responsible for each center. All data will be&#xD;
      centrally reviewed. Alerts will be sent for lost data, aberrant data or discrepancies&#xD;
      thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each center, local study investigators will review data from 5% of randomly selected&#xD;
      participants, and all participants about whom evaluators may have questions about&#xD;
      inconsistent data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection of all included cases will be verified by an independent research&#xD;
      coordinator hired through an external CRO and who will evaluate the quality of data&#xD;
      collection independently of the main researcher. Data collection will be re-evaluated until&#xD;
      the forms and all results are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full data will be required to include subjects in the final analysis, and only subjects&#xD;
      without missing data will be accepted for the primary variables or patients with missing data&#xD;
      less than 10% for the secondary variables, if these cannot be retrieved by the investigators.&#xD;
      All bizarre data will be sent to the reference centers for verification. The presence of&#xD;
      missing data in the main variables will be reason for the exclusion of the participant in the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical-legal aspects. The study will be carried out in accordance with the updated Helsinki&#xD;
      declaration in its latest version. The study protocol, together with the data collection&#xD;
      sheets and Annexes will be sent for approval to the Ethics and Research Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Getafe, and will ask them for a waiver consent due to the&#xD;
      characteristics of the study design (non-intervention study for statistical purposes, action&#xD;
      plan to improve the quality of care, in a health emergency situation), as provided in the&#xD;
      spanish laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not include any control group. Participation in this study does not imply any&#xD;
      risk for the included patients since it is based on the usual clinical practice in common use&#xD;
      in all hospitals, which are already applied at the Getafe University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be based on the Spanish legislation for biomedical research, and in accordance&#xD;
      with national laws of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of them that the identity of&#xD;
      the subject will be kept confidential and anonymous throughout the study, in such a way that&#xD;
      no personal data will be collected that allows the identification of the subjects included&#xD;
      and only the data necessary to achieve the study objectives will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the document is not&#xD;
      authorized in any way without the written consent of the Steering Committee. Given that the&#xD;
      study proposes the analysis of the usual clinical practice, it is considered not pertinent to&#xD;
      contract a civil liability insurance, since it is a low-intensity clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period of inclusion of the participants, the database to which only the study&#xD;
      coordinating team (principal investigator and co-investigators) will have access will be&#xD;
      generated anonymously, with irreversible dissociation of personal data.&#xD;
