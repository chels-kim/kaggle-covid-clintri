  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      40 COVID-19 survivors that have been discharged from the hospital will be included in this&#xD;
      investigator-blinded randomised study with a 12-week exercise intervention. Patients will be&#xD;
      1:1 block-randomised by sex to either a supervised high intensity interval-based exercise&#xD;
      group or standard care (control group).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients will be recruited and undergo baseline testing, including examination,&#xD;
      biochemistry, ECG, DXA, OGTT, Pulmonary function, VO2max, RM, plasma volume, AX3, CGM,&#xD;
      echocardiography, cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline testing, participants will be randomly allocated into one group receiving&#xD;
      standard of care (control group) or a group performing supervised high-intensity interval&#xD;
      training three times a week over a period of 12 weeks. The randomization procedure involves a&#xD;
      computer-generated block randomization schedule in a ratio of 1:1 stratified by sex by an&#xD;
      independent person. Following the 12-week intervention period, both groups will complete a&#xD;
      series of follow-up tests (as baseline testing). A 1-year follow-up experimental day is also&#xD;
      planned in order to evaluate fitness, cardiac and pulmonary structure and function.&#xD;
