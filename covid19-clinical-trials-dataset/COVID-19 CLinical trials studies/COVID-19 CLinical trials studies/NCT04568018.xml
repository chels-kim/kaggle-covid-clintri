  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prove the efficacy and safety Surfactant-BL, administered by&#xD;
      inhalation in adult hospitalized patients with ARDS due to COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of Surfactant-BL will be evaluated in terms of mean duration of&#xD;
      oxygen therapy (days) after hospitalization, in adult patients with ARDS due to SARS-COV-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure will be receive either standard&#xD;
      treatment or standard treatment plus Surfactant-BL.&#xD;
