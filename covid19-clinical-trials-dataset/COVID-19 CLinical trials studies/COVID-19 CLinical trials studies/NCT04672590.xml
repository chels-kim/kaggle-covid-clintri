  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Recent reports increasingly recognize neurological manifestations in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. However, the full spectrum of the disease and risk factors are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To describe the full spectrum of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 and assess the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, risks and prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Identification of COVID-19 associated neurological disease is the primary outcome&#xD;
      while requirement for admission to critical care unit, mortality, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      quality of life, and neurological disability are the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients above Age more than 18 years enrolled based on new-onset acute&#xD;
      neurological disease and COVID19 positive will serve as cases while patient with confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 without neurological manifestation will serve as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedures: The study is prospective case control in design and is divided into&#xD;
      three phases in India, Brazil and Malawi ; the first phase will address role of hypoxia in&#xD;
      causation of neurological diseases, the second phase will compare characteristics of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without neurological disease and the third phase will&#xD;
      assess the long-term follow up (at 3 months and 9 months) of cases.&#xD;
