  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is study is comprised of three approaches. First, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study to provide rapid initial guidance for rehabilitation programs to&#xD;
      anticipate care needs of COVID-19 survivors. The investigators will also conduct a&#xD;
      mixed-methods study and follow COVID-19 patients with repeated surveys to determine&#xD;
      patient-reported functional outcomes, health recovery and rehabilitation needs after&#xD;
      COVID-19. The investigators will recruit patients and their informal caregivers for&#xD;
      interviews to assess their function and rehabilitation needs. Lastly, the investigators will&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtually delivered, home-based rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention for survivors of COVID-19, with components based on an individual patient's&#xD;
      need.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The long-term consequences of COVID 19 are not well understood, particularly in the Veteran&#xD;
      population. This study will describe and quantify the long-term consequences of COVID-19,&#xD;
      including impairment in physical and psychosocial function and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life. Additionally, it will determine the impact of chronic lung disease (CLD) and other&#xD;
      comorbidities on severity and recovery after COVID-19 infection and the association of social&#xD;
      determinants of health with severity and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a retrospective national cohort of VA patients who test positive with SARS2 will&#xD;
      be identified. Baseline clinical history will be analyzed with outcomes that include severity&#xD;
      of COVID 19, all-cause mortality, and post-discharge events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, a mixed methods, prospective cohort study will include both qualitative&#xD;
      (interview) and quantitative components (surveys). The investigators will identify patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 and recruited for qualitative interviews following hospital discharge or&#xD;
      diagnosis. Patient caregivers will also be eligible to participate in study interviews.&#xD;
      Interviews will occur once at various times ranging 2 weeks to 1 year since a patient's&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis. Surveys will be completed at 3 time points, 3-8 weeks after diagnosis or&#xD;
      discharge to home, and then 6 months and 12 months later. Surveys will include the EQ-5D-5L&#xD;
      profile for health-related quality of life, and the WHODAS 2.0 score for a global assessment&#xD;
      of overall physical and psychosocial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will conduct a single-arm pilot feasibility trial to develop an&#xD;
      initial feasibility testing of a rehabilitation-focused program to improve physical and&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning. This will involve patients with COVID-19 who were discharged home&#xD;
      or 2 weeks after diagnosis if not hospitalized.&#xD;
