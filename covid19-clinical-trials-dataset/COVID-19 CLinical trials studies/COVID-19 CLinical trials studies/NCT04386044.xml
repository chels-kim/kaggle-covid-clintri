  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) pandemic is an enormous health issue of&#xD;
      worldwide scale. Prevention and/or treatment with a widely-available and already-licensed&#xD;
      product such as vitamin D (cholecalciferol) could have a large impact on healthcare&#xD;
      worldwide. Given ethnic variation in vitamin D production, this could help to address the&#xD;
      discrepancies in how people of different ethnicities are affected by COVID-19. There are&#xD;
      currently no published studies analysing either individual-level evidence on the effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D status on COVID-19 outcomes, or any prospective studies planning on following-up&#xD;
      patients with reference to vitamin D and COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have 2 arms. Arm 1 will recruit patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Vitamin D&#xD;
      levels will be measured in these patients and compared with outcome measures of COVID-19&#xD;
      severity. In Arm 2, patients will be recruited prospectively from local general practices&#xD;
      (GPs) with measurement of vitamin D levels at enrolment. They will be followed up after 6&#xD;
      months to determine whether baseline vitamin D levels correspond with developing COVID-19.&#xD;
      Data will be collected from a mixture of patient medical records, electronic patient records,&#xD;
      laboratory data and from patients themselves. Data in Arm 1 will be analysed with a&#xD;
      combination of linear and logistic regression, as appropriate, and with adjustment for&#xD;
      covariates. Data in Arm 2 will be analysed as a case-control study, with adjustment for&#xD;
      covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to determine whether vitamin D levels affect outcomes in COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Arm 1: Hospital in-patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 This will be&#xD;
      an observational cohort study of patients hospitalised at Tameside General Hospital with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, as defined by the clinical coding department. Patient&#xD;
      identifiers will be extracted by the coding department and held on a secure server at&#xD;
      Tameside Hospital. Identifiers will be used to ensure serum samples already taken as part of&#xD;
      routine clinical management of these patients can be processed for a vitamin D level. No&#xD;
      additional blood samples will need to be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic details will be extracted from their clinical notes and electronic&#xD;
      patient records, then placed on an anonymised database for analysis. Data will be analysed to&#xD;
      determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are vitamin D levels associated with outcomes/prognosis in patients hospitalised with&#xD;
           COVID-19?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are vitamin D levels associated with ethnicity in patients hospitalised with COVID-19?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are vitamin D levels associated with comorbidity in patients hospitalised with COVID-19?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projected recruitment is 200 patients to be opportunistically recruited who are undergoing&#xD;
      usual clinical care for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Primary care patients prospectively studied with reference to baseline vitamin D and&#xD;
      risk of COVID-19 Patients will be prospectively recruited from local GP surgeries within the&#xD;
      Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group. Patients will be consented by Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP)-certified practitioners. A serum sample will be collected on&#xD;
      recruitment for a baseline vitamin D level to be obtained. Patient contact details will be&#xD;
      collected, as well as baseline health status and comorbidities, then stored on an encrypted&#xD;
      database on a secure server at Tameside Hospital. Vitamin D levels will be communicated to GP&#xD;
      surgeries and GPs can decide whether to treat patients according to local treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for suboptimal vitamin D. After 6 months, patients will be followed-up via&#xD;
      telephone interview, in order to ascertain whether they have developed COVID-19, any&#xD;
      treatment outcomes for this, and whether they have been treated with vitamin D in the interim&#xD;
      in primary/secondary/tertiary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed once all recruited patients have been followed-up after 6 months. At&#xD;
      follow-up, patients who have developed COVID-19 will be deemed to be cases, and those who&#xD;
      have not will be deemed to be controls, for a case-control analysis using vitamin D levels as&#xD;
      an exploratory covariate. It is anticipated that there will be some patient drop-out, but&#xD;
      compliance with follow-up is likely to be high, due to the use of a telephone interview.&#xD;
      Analysis will aim to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the risk of&#xD;
      developing COVID-19, with reference to additional covariates, such as ethnicity and&#xD;
      comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projected recruitment is 800 patients to be opportunistically recruited who are attending&#xD;
      their GP surgery for routine care, not necessarily related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;

      ANALYSIS Arm 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean values of age and gender, as well as proportions of different ethnic groups, will be&#xD;
      used to assess group comparability. Primary analysis will involve linear regression of&#xD;
      vitamin D levels (as a continuous variable, with adjustment for age and gender) against&#xD;
      variables representing COVID-19 treatment outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mode of oxygen therapy (low-flow &lt;10L/min, high-flow&gt;=10L/min, nasal high-flow, CPAP,&#xD;
           endotracheal intubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment history (excluding oxygen therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will also include logistic regression of ethnic groups against the above&#xD;
      treatment outcome variables, with adjustment for age, gender and vitamin D status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be included as additional predictors of severity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray findings on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D-dimer on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjusted calcium on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be included as covariates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SARS-CoV-2 swab result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression will be reported as a coefficient with a 95% confidence interval. Logistic&#xD;
      regression will be reported as an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Missing&#xD;
      data will be imputed. Analysis will be carried out once all data has been collected for n=200&#xD;
      patients and serum vitamin D levels are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean values of age and gender, as well as proportions of different ethnic groups, will be&#xD;
      used to assess group comparability. Once all data has been collected, patients who developed&#xD;
      COVID-19 will be defined as &quot;cases&quot; and those who did not will be defined as &quot;controls.&quot; A&#xD;
      case-control study including vitamin D as a predictor variable will then be carried out, with&#xD;
      statistics reported as an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Further&#xD;
      subanalysis will be carried out on the following outcome measures (again, being defined as a&#xD;
      &quot;case&quot;):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalisation with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge from hospital following treatment for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be included as additional predictors of severity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be included as covariates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data at enrolment will be imputed. Patients lost to follow-up will have baseline data&#xD;
      included and they will be treated as a &quot;control.&quot; Analysis will be carried out once all&#xD;
      follow-up data has been collected for n=800 patients recruited.&#xD;
