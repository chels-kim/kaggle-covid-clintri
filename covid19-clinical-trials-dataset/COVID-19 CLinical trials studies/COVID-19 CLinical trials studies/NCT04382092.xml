  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International guidelines suggest the administration of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics&#xD;
      for suspected bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 critically ill. However, data on associated&#xD;
      respiratory infections is rare and antimicrobial stewardship interventions promoting&#xD;
      antibiotic savings are non-existent in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to evaluate the rate of co-infections among COVID-19 critically ill to evaluate the added&#xD;
      value of a a rapid molecular diagnostic tool (FA-PNEU) to detect the presence of co-infecting&#xD;
      pathogens in order to rapidly tailor the patient's antibiotic treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of April 2020, the World Health Organisation reported that nearly three million&#xD;
      people worldwide were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) of whom 202 000 people already died from the associated disease named COVID-19.&#xD;
      Clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic carriage to a severe respiratory infection&#xD;
      with an acute respiratory distress syndrome and it has been calculated that approximately 5%&#xD;
      of COVID-19 patients require intensive care. Dramatically, the reported mortality rate 28&#xD;
      days following admission upon the intensive care unit (ICU) is as high as 61.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 23th of March, an expert team of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) has released a&#xD;
      series of guidelines on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill in which they address&#xD;
      recommendations on infection control and testing, hemodynamic control, ventilatory support&#xD;
      and therapy. Considering the latter, the use of empiric antimicrobial/antibacterial agents is&#xD;
      suggested among patients who have respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      because of suspected co-infection. Reported rates of bacterial co-infection in Influenza A&#xD;
      patients range from 6 to 65%. It could be thought that SARS-CoV-2 destroys the respiratory&#xD;
      epithelium in a similar way thereby facilitating bacterial invasion. SSC experts further&#xD;
      suggest to assess for de-escalation. Rationally the adjustment to a targeted antibiotherapy&#xD;
      requires a microbiological diagnosis of the suspected bacterial co-infection. Contemporary&#xD;
      laboratory culture-based testing on lower respiratory tract samples requires a minimum of&#xD;
      24-48 hours to obtain respectively identification and antimicrobial susceptibility results.&#xD;
      During this incompressible time interval, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is&#xD;
      maintained with a risk of selecting multi-resistant bacteria potentially causing nosocomial&#xD;
      infections. Aiming to reduce time of microbiological analysis, molecular tools have been very&#xD;
      recently developed allowing the detection of a panel of microorganisms including bacteria and&#xD;
      viruses directly from a lower respiratory tract sample within a few hours. Recent evaluations&#xD;
      reported satisfying performances compared to routine microbiological methods and forecasted a&#xD;
      substantial benefit of molecular testing in the speeded-up instauration of a targeted&#xD;
      antibiotherapy and isolation precautions in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective clinical trial, the investigators performed a rapid molecular test on the&#xD;
      initial lower respiratory sample of each COVID-19 patient admitted to ICU. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study was to determine the rate of co-infections in COVID-19 critically ill&#xD;
      and the secondary objective was to measure the impact of the rapid molecular diagnostic test&#xD;
      on the antimicrobial management of all included patients. The investigators hypothesized the&#xD;
      rapid results of the detected pathogens will support the intensive care physician in the&#xD;
      initiation of a targeted antibiotic treatment but also in the weaning of any antibiotherapy&#xD;
      if all microorganisms remain undetected.&#xD;
