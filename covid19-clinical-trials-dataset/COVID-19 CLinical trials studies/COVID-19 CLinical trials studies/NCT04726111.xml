    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare placental pathologies in patients with COVID 19 infection&#xD;
      at the time of childbirth or a history of COVID 19 during pregnancy versus control patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The second wave of COVID 19 is currently sweeping through Europe. If the first wave brought&#xD;
      reassuring elements on the risk of maternal-fetal transmission, it nevertheless counted an&#xD;
      increase in severe maternal forms in the third trimester associated with more premature&#xD;
      deliveries and cesarean sections. In addition, due to the very recent nature of this new&#xD;
      infection, we have little data on the effect of SARS-COV 2 contracted during pregnancy on the&#xD;
      fetus and on maternal-fetal exchanges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications report an increase in growth retardation, maternal coagulopathies, preeclampsia&#xD;
      and placental thrombosis. The vascular placental abnormalities observed in the first series&#xD;
      must be confirmed and refined. Finally, pregnancy is marked by immunomodulation which can&#xD;
      interfere with immune reactions. A better understanding of the immunological mechanisms in&#xD;
      the mother and of the immunity transmitted to the fetus is necessary to better understand the&#xD;
      maternal-fetal issues of COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study concerns patients presenting for their delivery at Foch Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 groups of patients will be identified in the delivery room after childbirth based on their&#xD;
      COVID 19 PCR taken within 72 hours, their COVID 19 serology, or a history of positive COVID&#xD;
      19 PCR during pregnancy : 1 control group of 50 patients, 1 group of 50 asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients, 1 group of 50 patients with symptoms, and 1 group of 50 cured patients who&#xD;
      contracted the disease during pregnancy. The patients will have various samples: blood,&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, placenta&#xD;
