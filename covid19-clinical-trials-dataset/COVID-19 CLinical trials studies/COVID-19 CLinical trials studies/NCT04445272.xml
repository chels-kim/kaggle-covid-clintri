    <textblock>
      At present, no treatment has been approved for COVID-19. However, in light of the increased&#xD;
      interest on using the anti-cytokine therapy targeting IL-6 tocilizumab in COVID-19 infected&#xD;
      patients due to its potential benefit, the Spanish Agency for Medicine and Health Products&#xD;
      (Agencia Espa√±ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, AEMPS) have initiated the&#xD;
      controlled distribution of the drug. Tocilizumab is indeed proposed as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for severe COVID-19 in Spain. Based on the positive results of tocilizumab in the treatment&#xD;
      of COVID-19 patients and the experience of tocilizumab in inducing rapid reversal of CSS in&#xD;
      other pathologies several clinical trials and observational studies are being conducted to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. Further studies with&#xD;
      a large sample size are required to confirm the effectiveness of tocilizumab in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for the management of severe COVID-19 disease is imperative, and every effort should&#xD;
      be made to collect relevant clinical outcomes. The aim of the present study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of IV tocilizumab in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are&#xD;
      currently hospitalized or admitted to ICU by describing improvement of respiratory function&#xD;
      and mortality rate. This large real-world cohort therefore provides a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      study this potential medicine during the current emergency situation, and support the&#xD;
      findings from other ongoing clinical trials and observational studies, such as the&#xD;
      Roche-sponsored Phase III study that is planned to start early April.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is caused by the excessive release of cytokines during an&#xD;
      exaggerated immune response. CSS can be triggered by infections or therapeutic interventions,&#xD;
      being more severe depending on the degree and duration of immune activation. CSS is as a&#xD;
      significant on-target side-effect of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, which&#xD;
      have been subject to assessment for the treatment of haematological malignancies. Tocilizumab&#xD;
      (intravenous, IV) is indicated for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor CAR T&#xD;
      cell-induced severe or life-threatening CSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the experience with tocilizumab in the CSS, and that some patients infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 can develop CSS, leading to potentially fatal damage to lung tissue, the drug is&#xD;
      being investigated in China and Italy, and clinical trials are being conducted/planned in&#xD;
      these and several other countries. Real-word experience with tocilizumab IV have shown that&#xD;
      in a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, fever returned to&#xD;
      normal and respiratory function based on oxygen intake and lung opacities improved&#xD;
      remarkably. Laboratory parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP) that seem to be increased&#xD;
      in patients infected decreased significantly with tocilizumab, and lymphocytes levels also&#xD;
      returned to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these findings have led the Spanish Agency for Medicine and Health Products (AEMPS) to&#xD;
      initiate the controlled distribution of tocilizumab IV, in light of the increased interest on&#xD;
      the anti-cytokine therapy targeting IL-6 in COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      tocilizumab might be among the therapeutic armamentarium for preventing the fatal&#xD;
      consequences of acute respiratory and multi organ failure in around 20% of the COVID-19&#xD;
      infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IV tocilizumab in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia who are currently hospitalized or admitted to ICU.&#xD;
      This large real-world cohort provides a unique opportunity to study a potential medicine&#xD;
      during the current emergency situation, and support the findings from the Roche-sponsored&#xD;
      Phase III study that is planned to start in early April.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive IV tocilizumab as per clinical practice and at the discretion of treating investigator, following the posology indicated in the SmPC, or the recommendations proposed by the Spanish Ministry of Health:&#xD;
The recommended posology by the SmPC is 8 mg per kg in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg per kg in patients weighing less than 30 kg. If no clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms up to 3 additional doses of tocilizumab may be administered. The interval between consecutive doses should be at least 8 hours.&#xD;
The recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health:&#xD;
Patients more than 80 kg: first dose 600 mg; second dose 600 mg. Patients less than 80 kg: first dose 600 mg; second dose 400 mg.&#xD;
A third dose might be considered 16 to 24 hours after if: fever persists or a worsening of the laboratory parameters&#xD;
Given the exceptionality of the situation modification of doses according to the physician experience will be allowed.</description>
