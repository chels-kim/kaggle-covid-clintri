  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infection linked to a new coronavirus: SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in Wuhan in&#xD;
      China at the end of 2019, and which has since spread around the world, responsible for a new&#xD;
      major pandemic, which is upsetting the whole world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If severe respiratory disease is the form that constitutes the extreme gravity of the disease&#xD;
      (mortality, with more than 170,000 deaths worldwide to date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a great heterogeneity of clinical forms with asymptomatic or symptomatic&#xD;
      pauci forms, moderate forms, up to severe forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different symptoms may appear: fever, cough, asthenia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal forms,&#xD;
      anosmia and / or ageusia, skin involvement, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the novelty of this infection, several questions remain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are all the symptoms that can be contracted by a COVID-19 patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there clinical forms not described?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the evolutionary profile, the healing time of this disease in patients treated&#xD;
           on an outpatient basis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the factors associated with a prolonged form of COVID-19 disease, including on&#xD;
           an outpatient basis?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of the descriptive studies relating to COVID-19 relate to the severe forms of the&#xD;
      disease managed in the hospital sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few data have been published on moderate forms, requiring no hospitalization, of strict&#xD;
      outpatient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These so-called moderate forms, however, constitute the majority of cases of COVID-19&#xD;
      (approximately 80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department of Pitie Salpetriere, COVIDOM pilot site,&#xD;
      at the beginning of March, during the intensification of the epidemic in France, a weekly&#xD;
      telephone consultation was set up to take care of people tested for COVID + by PCR, or people&#xD;
      not tested by PCR, or even tested with negative PCR but symptomatic and followed at home,&#xD;
      suffering from moderate form of COVID-19, as well as their contact cases if they wished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine is particularly suitable in this epidemic context, ensuring continuity of care,&#xD;
      while limiting face-to-face consultations, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the novelty of this infection, it is important to be able to best characterize these&#xD;
      ambulatory forms, as well as their evolution, in order to manage these patients, and to offer&#xD;
      primary care physicians a more detailed description of these forms. , which they are and will&#xD;
      be called upon to take care of, general medicine being central to dealing with the epidemic.&#xD;

        Enrolment will be done from the active queue of patients included in the COVIDOM / PSL&#xD;
        platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will be a monocentric data collection. The patient is called, on working days,&#xD;
        weekly from D0 to D30, and beyond if the symptoms persist on D30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Data will be collected at D0, D7, D14, D21 and D30. The visit on D30 corresponds to the end&#xD;
        of the systematic weekly telephone interviews if the patient has reached complete recovery,&#xD;
        defined by the absence of symptoms for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the symptoms persist on D30: monitoring is continued, on D45 and D60, and beyond if&#xD;
        necessary.&#xD;
