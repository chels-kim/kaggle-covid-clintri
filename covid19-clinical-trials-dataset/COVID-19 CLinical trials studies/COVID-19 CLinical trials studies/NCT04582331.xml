    <textblock>
      This is a confirmatory study that seeks to examine whether respiratory-responsive vocal&#xD;
      biomarkers have potential to respond to COVID-19 infection status and respiratory symptom&#xD;
      severity. Patients with suspected COVID-19 and healthy controls will submit daily voice&#xD;
      samples and symptom inventories on their personal smartphone devices for 14 days.&#xD;

      This is an observational study examining the potential to use voice analysis to aid in the&#xD;
      identification of COVID-19 and as an aid to monitoring of respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.&#xD;
      Patients with suspected COVID-19 and healthy controls will be enrolled and use their own&#xD;
      smartphone device to provide daily voice samples and symptom inventories. This study seeks to&#xD;
      confirm and extend findings from preliminary data from patients with asthma, COPD and cough&#xD;
      that has indicated the potential of respiratory responsive vocal biomarkers (RRVB) to respond&#xD;
      to respiratory diagnoses and symptom severity. The same RRVB will be examined to confirm&#xD;
      whether this potential generalizes to respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19&#xD;
