  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia caused by coronavirus infection COVID-19 is characterized by a combination of&#xD;
      several dangerous factors that consistently worsen the patient's condition: viral lung damage&#xD;
      early in the disease; a sharp increase in inflammation on the background of an unbalanced&#xD;
      immune response (&quot;cytokine storm&quot;); joining a bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition of patients deteriorates significantly mostly at cytokine storm development.&#xD;
      The damaging of a large volume of lung tissue leads to develops of respiratory failure,&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, or shock. Ventilatory support becomes ineffective and patients&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are reports of the effectiveness of Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous&#xD;
      Administration (IVIG) high doses when used as part of complex therapy in patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia caused by coronavirus COVID-19. In particular, IVIG has a positive effect on&#xD;
      survival rates, overall disease course, duration of stay in the intensive care unit, and&#xD;
      ventilatory support duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probable mechanism of action of high-dose IVIG therapy is considered to be a regulatory&#xD;
      effect on the immune system. Similar is the known and confirmed effectiveness of IVIG for&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases (Kavasaky disease, Guillain Barre syndrome, Chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, Multifocal motor neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial to assesses the Efficacy of IVIG (medication trade name - Bioven, manufactured by&#xD;
      Biopharma Plasma LLC) in the High Immunomodulatory Dose in Complex Treatment of Severe&#xD;
      Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2&#xD;

      The screening stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient or his legal representative must sign an informed consent. After signing the&#xD;
      informed consent, the screening tests&amp;procedures are performed and the compliance with the&#xD;
      inclusion / non-inclusion criteria is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have been screened and meet the inclusion criteria and do not fall under the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, a blinded randomization procedure is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed by the IVRS method, according to the blinded-block patient's&#xD;
      randomization table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical stage of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Begins after patient randomization. At the clinical stage, among other things, provides:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the individual dose of the study drug (in the study group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of the drug (in the study group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  registration of information about taking antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  registration of information on symptomatic therapy and administration of drugs for the&#xD;
           treatment of comorbidities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body&#xD;
           temperature);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of SPO2 level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the need for ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the need for intensive care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of compliance with the exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Control Group will receive therapy recommended by the COVID-19 coronavirus&#xD;
      infection treatment protocol, depending on the severity of their condition according to the&#xD;
      prescribing list, which will not include immunoglobulin preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of the Study Group (IVIG) receive high-dose therapy with the study drug (Bioven, 10%&#xD;
      solution for infusions produced by Biopharma Plasma LLC, Ukraine). The dose is calculated by&#xD;
      body weight. Patients will also receive therapy recommended by the COVID-19 coronavirus&#xD;
      infection treatment protocol, depending on the severity of their condition according to the&#xD;
      prescribing list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioven administered intravenously, at an initial rate of 0.5 - 1.0 ml/kg body weight/hour for&#xD;
      30 minutes. In the absence of any undesirable side effects, the rate of administration can be&#xD;
      gradually increased (recommended increase by 0.5 - 1.5 ml/kg body weight/hour every 10&#xD;
      minutes). According to results previously accomplished clinical studies, the maximum rate of&#xD;
      Bioven administration is up to 8.5 ml/kg body weight/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation and completion stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Begins and continues from the last administration of the study drug until the discharge of&#xD;
      the patient from the hospital, but not less than 28 days from the confirmation of the&#xD;
      diagnosis of pneumonia caused by coronavirus infection COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are provided at the stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  registration of information about taking antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  registration of information on symptomatic therapy and administration of drugs for the&#xD;
           treatment of comorbidities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body&#xD;
           temperature);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of SPO2 level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  registration of the results of the examination of the lungs by computed tomography (or&#xD;
           radiography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  taking biomaterials for laboratory research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general blood test (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, expanded leukocyte formula, platelets,&#xD;
           etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general analysis of urine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biochemical analysis of blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  state of the coagulation system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of inflammatory factors in the dynamics (CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin;&#xD;
           TNF-Î±), IL-1-beta, IL-6, complement component C3 (C3), circulating immune complexes&#xD;
           (CIC), etc.),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of IgG subclasses (G1, G2, G3, G4,);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the need for ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the need for intensive care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse reactions registration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of compliance with the exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's condition is assessed daily till discharge; and by schedule after discharge (if&#xD;
      it happen earlier), during 28 days period after diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by&#xD;
      coronavirus infection COVID-19 In case of death of the patient - the date and cause of death&#xD;
