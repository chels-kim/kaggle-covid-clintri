  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the use of Life2000® Ventilator, a novel proportional open ventilation system in&#xD;
      critical care use of acute onset of respiratory failure (ARF) and mild to moderate forms of&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients and its ability to provide&#xD;
      effective ventilatory benefits and or delay patients from progressing to more aggressive&#xD;
      forms of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).&#xD;

POV support (Life2000) will be administered in six (6) to ten (ten) enrolled subjects based on clinical protocol flowchart (Appendix C). Specifically, if it is determined that a COVID-19 subject who would currently be considered for HFNC under current standard of treatment, will be eligible for POV treatment.&#xD;
The prescribed therapy regimen, including duration of therapy will be documented and COVID-19 patients who fail therapy and require IMV will be recorded.</intervention_model_description>
