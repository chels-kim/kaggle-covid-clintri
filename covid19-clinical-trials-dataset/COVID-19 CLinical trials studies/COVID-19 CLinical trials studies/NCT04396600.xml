    <textblock>
      The Professional Peer Resilience Initiative (PPRI) study is an observational study aimed at&#xD;
      understanding how symptoms of traumatic stress and resilience evolve over time in the&#xD;
      University of Minnesota (UMN) healthcare workforce during the coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) pandemic. The study is being conducted concurrently with a UMN peer support&#xD;
      program called the MinnRAP program and will remotely administer quality of life and mental&#xD;
      health surveys to healthcare workers before they start the MinnRAP program and throughout&#xD;
      their participation in the program.&#xD;
