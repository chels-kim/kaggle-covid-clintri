  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim is to collect breath samples from COVID-19 positive patients at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, during and after recovery using the same patient as his/her own control to&#xD;
      identify VOCs specific to SARS-COV-2 viral infection. A secondary aim is to determine the&#xD;
      patient's likely disease trajectory in terms of recovery versus progression to respiratory&#xD;
      and or multi-organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath samples will be collected as soon as the patient is admitted to the Vancouver General&#xD;
      Hospital COVID Ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal/throat swab. A&#xD;
      second breath sample will be obtained one week later, or before hospital discharge or if they&#xD;
      become sicker prior to transfer to the intensive care. A third sample will be taken to 8-12&#xD;
      weeks after recovery from the illness with a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test. VOCs in exhaled&#xD;
      breath will be measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS or GCxGC-TOFMS).&#xD;
      VOC profiles from the symptomatic phase and recovery phase will be compared to determine if&#xD;
      there are unique VOCs associated with COVID-19 infection. Comparison of VOC profiles between&#xD;
      those who recover and those who progressed will provide information on potential prognostic&#xD;
      features. The results of this pilot study will form the basis to determine if a larger study&#xD;
      is warranted.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited from the COVID wards at VGH, all patients admitted will be given a&#xD;
      letter of invite on admission if eligible and if interested and eligible will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Sample for the study will be collected at the VGH COVID patient wards. Consenting patients&#xD;
      and breath collection will be performed in the patients' hospital room with proper personnel&#xD;
      protective equipment. A verbal consent will be collected as to not contaminate consent forms.&#xD;
      A paper copy will be given or emailed to the participants to have for their own records. .We&#xD;
      aim to recruit up to 20 patients. The final number will be dependent on the number of new&#xD;
      cases in Vancouver available for the study after REB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional participants will be recruited from community testing sites. Participants will be&#xD;
      approached to be invited to participate while waiting in their vehicles at the drive-by&#xD;
      testing sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath samples will be analyzed on a SepSolve GC-TOF MS system at the BC Cancer Research&#xD;
      Institute.&#xD;
