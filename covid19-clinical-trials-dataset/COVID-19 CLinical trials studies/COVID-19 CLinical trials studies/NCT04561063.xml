      This is a randomised, multi-center, open label, adaptive, exploratory trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of two different drug regimens in terms of preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The trial will compare two&#xD;
      different experimental medication arms to the control arm comprising the use of standard&#xD;
      personal protective equipment (PPE) with no additional pharmacological intervention.&#xD;

      This is a randomised, multi-center, open label, adaptive, exploratory trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of two different drug regimens in terms of preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The trial will compare two&#xD;
      different experimental medication arms to the control arm comprising the use of standard&#xD;
      personal protective equipment (PPE) with no additional pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be recruited from participating institutions and community healthcare workers&#xD;
      (CHWs) that are responsible for collecting swabs for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Up to 1950&#xD;
      (or 2130 pending funding) eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of&#xD;
      the investigational arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed until 65 PCR and serology-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 infections are&#xD;
      identified in the control arm (or 165 in the entire study cohort). For each episode of&#xD;
      PCR-confirmed COVID-19 disease, data on self-reported symptoms (modified Flu-PRO) and their&#xD;
      duration, and an investigator-assessed severity score (WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical&#xD;
      Improvement) will be recorded. Data on self-reported symptoms and duration will also be&#xD;
      collected for other all-cause acute respiratory illnesses. Safety and tolerability of each&#xD;
      arm will be assessed through adverse event reporting. Participants who develop COVID-19&#xD;
      disease will have their IMP discontinued but will be followed up in the study until the&#xD;
      completion of the trial, where possible. Multiple, discrete occurrences of COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      could therefore be identified in a single participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional arms may be added, or existing ones substituted, should new potential agents be&#xD;
      identified or other combinations for prophylaxis be proposed. A formal amendment will be&#xD;
      documented should this be considered.&#xD;
