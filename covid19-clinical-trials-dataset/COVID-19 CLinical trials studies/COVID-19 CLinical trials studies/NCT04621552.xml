  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selection of the appropriate size of the device is mandatory during aneurysm treatment with a&#xD;
      WEB. The Investigators aimed to investigate if virtual simulation with Sim&amp;Size software may&#xD;
      have an impact on technical, angiographic, and clinical outcomes after WEB treatment. Data&#xD;
      from two large-volume centers were collected and compared (January 2017-January 2020).&#xD;
      Virtual simulation was systematically adopted in one center, while conventional sizing was&#xD;
      used in the other one. Outcomes were the duration of intervention, the radiation dose (mGy),&#xD;
      the number of corrective interventions for inappropriate WEB size, the number of WEBs not&#xD;
      deployed, angiographic occlusion, and complications. Univariate and multivariate linear&#xD;
      models were adopted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Flow disruption with Woven EndoBridge (WEB) is an innovative treatment that has been&#xD;
      evaluated in several prospective and retrospective studies1-3. The efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      this strategy has been largely proved, and nowadays, indications for WEBs are progressively&#xD;
      enlarged. Appropriate sizing of the device is the key factor for treatment with a WEB.&#xD;
      Undersized devices may lead to insufficient coverage of the aneurysm neck and inadequate&#xD;
      filling of the volume of the sac, lowering the angiographic success. On the other hand, an&#xD;
      excessively oversized WEB may cause an unwarranted protrusion into the parent vessel,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of ischemic events. The conventional approach for WEB sizing is based on&#xD;
      two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2D-DSA), adding 1mm to the average width (to&#xD;
      assure good wall apposition), and subtracting 1mm to the average height of the aneurysm (to&#xD;
      adjust for the longitudinal increase caused by the horizontal compression)4. However, the&#xD;
      operator has to anticipate the behavior of the device, predicting tridimensional&#xD;
      modifications of the WEB in relation to the volume and shape of the aneurysm dome and neck.&#xD;
      Accordingly, appropriate WEB sizing could be difficult and may require experience. Data about&#xD;
      software-based simulation to predict changes after device implantation have been reported for&#xD;
      flow diversion and braided stents5-7. The Sim&amp;Size software (Sim&amp;Cure, Grabels, France) is&#xD;
      able to perform virtual sizing before WEB deployment using pre or per-operative&#xD;
      three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) acquisition. The virtual simulation helps to&#xD;
      select the most appropriate size of the device, predicting the behavior of the WEB inside the&#xD;
      aneurysm dome, and the surface of the WEB apposition, anticipating protrusion over the neck&#xD;
      or inappropriate coverage of the ostium. This multicenter study aimed to explore if the use&#xD;
      of the Sim&amp;Size software during endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms with WEB&#xD;
      devices was associated with measurables procedural advantages compared with conventional&#xD;
      sizing methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigated outcomes were 1) the median duration of the intervention; 2) the&#xD;
      median radiation dose; 3) the need of corrective interventions; and 4) the number of WEBs&#xD;
      opened but finally not deployed because of the inappropriate size of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary investigated endpoints were 1) the overall rate of complications&#xD;
      (peri-procedural and long-term adverse events); 2) the morbidity rate (complications&#xD;
      associated with permanent change of the clinical and neurological status of the patient); and&#xD;
      3) short-term (6 months) and long-term (12 months or more) aneurysm occlusion and WEB-shape&#xD;
      change (&quot;compaction&quot;) (decrease in height of the device or a deepening of the proximal and&#xD;
      distal concave recesses during follow-up9 based on non-subtracted images)&#xD;
