  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date there is no brain imaging and olfactory data available in COVID-19 positive patients&#xD;
      with anosmia. By describing the pathophysiological characteristics underlying the olfactory&#xD;
      symptoms and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection, the study investigators wish to&#xD;
      compare the MRI aspects obtained in COVID-19 patients with and without anosmia, in the&#xD;
      absence of other underlying neurological disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain mapping of COVID-19 patients with or without anosmia will allow better understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms leading to the onset of these symptoms and will provide a pathophysiological&#xD;
      basis for the therapeutic interventions to improve the clinical prognosis of affected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that in COVID-19 patients witch anosmia the brain mapping&#xD;
      objectified by an MRI examination is modified and that there are functional abnormalities in&#xD;
      the brain in these patients.&#xD;
