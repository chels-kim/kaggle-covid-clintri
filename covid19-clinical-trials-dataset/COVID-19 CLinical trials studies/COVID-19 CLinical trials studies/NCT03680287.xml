  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central scientific premise of the proposed study is that sleep disruption (SD) will&#xD;
      influence individuals' subjective response to blinded medication administration. The&#xD;
      investigators further believe these responses will vary among patients who have chronic low&#xD;
      back pain (CLBP) vs. healthy controls, and that sex will moderate effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study evaluates whether CLBP patients' subjective responses to study medication&#xD;
      administration are altered by SD. The investigators focus on two outcome domains: abuse&#xD;
      liability (i.e., drug liking and valuation) and response to pain testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a mixed between-within randomized crossover human-laboratory&#xD;
      experiment that investigates placebo-controlled effects of study medication on 1) abuse&#xD;
      liability metrics (Drug Liking and Monetary Valuation) and 2) response to laboratory-evoked&#xD;
      standardized pain measures, after one night of uninterrupted sleep (US) and again after one&#xD;
      night of SD. The investigators will recruit both CLBP patients(*) and healthy controls (N =&#xD;
      60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (*) We originally aimed to accrue 60 subjects with CLBP. However, we have been granted&#xD;
      approval by NIDA to reduce expectations for the target N for the CLBP cohort. We are no&#xD;
      longer expected to recruit N=60 CLBP participants; this is a COVID-19 modification, and we&#xD;
      are not required to re-do a power analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are presented with an array of choices (in dollar value) which they will compare to the option of receiving study drug. They will decide for each choice whether they would take the money (at that value) or the drug they received in the session. The outcome will be the &quot;crossover point&quot;, which is the mean of the last price that the participant selected &quot;drug&quot; and the first price at which the participant selected &quot;money&quot;.</description>

    <description>On the day after each sleep condition (Uninterrupted Sleep and Sleep Disruption), participants will undergo multiple injections of study medication or placebo. This is a double-blind within-subject Phase II trial. As such, study medications must remain blinded. Participants may receive a medication from one or more of the following categories: prescription stimulants, prescription benzodiazepines, prescription opioids, prescription cannabinoids, over-the-counter medications, or placebo (saline). This study uses a within-subject design, such that participants serve as participants' own control.</description>
