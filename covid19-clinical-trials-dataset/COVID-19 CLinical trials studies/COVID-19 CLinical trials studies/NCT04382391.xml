  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled investigation designed for comparison of&#xD;
      two groups for the reduction of respiratory distress in a CoViD-19 population, using&#xD;
      gammaCore Sapphire (nVNS) plus standard of care (active) vs. standard of care alone (SoC),&#xD;
      the control group. The gammaCore® (nVNS) treatments will be used acutely and&#xD;
      prophylactically. The active and control groups will be diseased and severity matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to reduce initiation of mechanical ventilation in patients with&#xD;
      CoViD-19 compared to the control group. Secondary objectives are to evaluate cytokine&#xD;
      trends/prevent cytokine storms, evaluate supplemental oxygen requirements, decrease mortality&#xD;
      of CoViD-19 patients and to delay the onset of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has an established history of reducing airway distress. VNS has&#xD;
      at least two mechanisms of action that may profoundly affect respiratory function in patients&#xD;
      with respiratory distress due to CoViD-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, vagus nerve stimulation modulates bronchoconstriction, acute stimulation has&#xD;
      demonstrated a marked improvement in Work of Breathing (WOB) as well as Forced Expiratory&#xD;
      Volume (FEV1) in patients with severe respiratory distress due to airway reactivity. This&#xD;
      effect appears to occur via an afferent response to stimulation of the vagus nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, and perhaps more importantly, VNS has been shown to be a potent moderator of&#xD;
      pathologic immune reactions, specifically suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via&#xD;
      activation of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP). VNS is currently being studied&#xD;
      to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines patterns and concentrations in a variety of acute and&#xD;
      progressive inflammatory conditions, ranging from septic shock and asthma to stroke,&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. VNS has been studied in animal models of&#xD;
      acute septic shock, consistently demonstrating life-saving potential. In one such study,&#xD;
      cecal ligation and puncture was used to induce a septic state in an animal model. VNS reduced&#xD;
      the expression of cytokines which was tightly associated with survival. Specifically, in&#xD;
      animal and human models, this neuromodulatory therapy has the capacity to reduce the&#xD;
      expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. These are precisely&#xD;
      the same cytokines which are elevated in ARDS and other inflammatory disorders. In all cases,&#xD;
      the therapy has shown considerable promise as a potential alternative to steroids (having&#xD;
      potent anti-inflammatory activity but without the adverse side effects of steroids) and&#xD;
      biologic therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines (broadly - e.g., tofacitinib, or&#xD;
      specifically - e.g., adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including those caused by SARS&#xD;
      CoV-1 and MERS are characterized by a massive systemic pro-inflammatory state. Although a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory environment is required to control the rate of infection as well as the&#xD;
      eradication of infected and compromised cells, the massive response to these viruses,&#xD;
      primarily due to leukocytes of the innate arm of the immune system, is part of the problem as&#xD;
      a significant number of tissues are damaged and lost secondary to the infected tissues in a&#xD;
      by-stander and collateral manner. A simple, drug-free approach to attenuate this systemic&#xD;
      inflammation would be of significant benefit to the progression of the syndrome and&#xD;
      potentially improve the overall recovery of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the investigators propose that VNS may ameliorate the over-activity of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory immune condition in CoViD-19 patients, thus conferring a superior&#xD;
      therapeutic option especially for elderly patients and those presenting with respiratory&#xD;
      illness in setting of co-morbid conditions who experience severe symptoms. These groups are&#xD;
      at particularly high risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, developing ARDS, experiencing&#xD;
      severe cytokine storm and have a higher mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) - Historically, VNS was delivered using implanted&#xD;
      signal generators coupled to leads having electrodes that wrap around the vagus nerve. The&#xD;
      vagus nerve is located within the carotid sheath, and thus the implantation surgery is&#xD;
      complicated with inherent risks, particularly in the critically ill. More recently, a&#xD;
      non-invasive approach to vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) was cleared by the FDA for the acute&#xD;
      treatment of pain associated episodic cluster and migraine headaches and the prevention of&#xD;
      cluster headaches and migraine headaches. This device, gammaCore (electroCore, Inc., Basking&#xD;
      Ridge, NJ) is handheld and requires no surgery or implants. The device is applied by&#xD;
      healthcare providers or patients to the skin at the neck over the vagus nerve to deliver&#xD;
      periodic doses of VNS non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to bronchoconstriction, early studies demonstrated modulation of airway&#xD;
      reactivity in hospitalized asthmatic patients, improving various measures of airway patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive VNS (nVNS) is a safe method of stimulating the vagus nerve, with minimal side&#xD;
      effects. It does not require surgery or an invasive procedure that would otherwise limit its&#xD;
      utility in the critically ill. The stimulation can be either self-administered or&#xD;
      administered by a health care practitioner. There are numerous studies with both implanted&#xD;
      and nVNS in multiple animal models and humans that have demonstrated a modulation of the&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade with an improvement in survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      gammaCore® (nVNS) has been studied in approximately 2,000 patients as part of clinical trials&#xD;
      with an excellent safety profile. It is available through commercial insurers and the private&#xD;
      pay market, and is listed on the federal supply schedule available for purchase by the VA and&#xD;
      Department of Defense and also carries a CE mark for distribution abroad. More than ten&#xD;
      thousand patients have been successfully treated in the United States and abroad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CoViD-19 Respiratory Issues Involve Virally-triggered Severe (Lethal) Cytokine Expression -&#xD;
      CoViD-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by SARS CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2) and is related to the coronavirus which caused SARS in 2003 (SARS&#xD;
      CoV-1). The virus is transmitted either through airborne droplets (e.g. coughing or sneezing)&#xD;
      or direct contact (e.g. through a surface containing the virus), with a mean incubation&#xD;
      period between 4 and 7 days (range 2 days to &gt; 2 weeks). As of April 3, 2020, there are over&#xD;
      a million confirmed cases and rising with 55,000 individuals deceased to date. This gives a&#xD;
      current mortality rate of 5.3 %, although the base case of confirmed cases may be markedly&#xD;
      underestimated. Elderly and those with co-morbid conditions including heart disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, and asthma seem to have a higher mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many CoViD-19 patients experience moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, including&#xD;
      shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of patients&#xD;
      present with respiratory symptoms. A significant and increasing number of CoViD-19 patients&#xD;
      require hospitalization, and progress to being intubated and/or ventilator dependent. Given&#xD;
      the rapid spread of this contagion, concern exists that the international healthcare systems&#xD;
      do not have the number of ventilators and/or ICU beds to meet the expected demand in the&#xD;
      coming months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most critically afflicted can experience pneumonia and/or ARDS. Accumulating evidence&#xD;
      suggests that this subgroup with severe CoViD-19 likely have a cytokine storm syndrome, a&#xD;
      hallmark of ARDS that includes dramatic increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, mainly TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β among others. Elevations in IL-6 seem to be a&#xD;
      particularly poor outcome indicator of respiratory compromise. It is believed that the&#xD;
      mortality of ARDS is at least partially the result of an over activity of the patient's&#xD;
      immune system.30 Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multi-center study of&#xD;
      150 confirmed CoViD-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297•6 ng/ml&#xD;
      in non-survivors vs 614•0 ng/ml in survivors; p&lt;0•001) and IL-6 (p&lt;0•0001)31, suggesting that&#xD;
      mortality and respiratory decompensation may be due to virally-driven hyperinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies that could block the cytokine storm may help improve survival and decrease the need&#xD;
      for ventilator use and prolonged respiratory support. Other companies are in fact developing&#xD;
      pharmaceutical approaches for the treatment of cytokine storm, or plasma infusions from those&#xD;
      who have recovered from the virus. At this point there is no cure or vaccine for the virus&#xD;
      and neither is there a treatment approach to dampen the systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the CE mark and excellent safety profile, including the twenty year history of the use&#xD;
      of VNS to block the over production of pro-inflammatory mediators via the CAP (cholinergic&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory pathway), and the lack of other effective or reasonable options during this&#xD;
      pandemic the investigators propose deploying gammaCore® (nVNS) devices for prophylactic use&#xD;
      to those who have been diagnosed as infected with the virus, but before the cytokine storm&#xD;
      begins to cause and/or exacerbate the severe respiratory distress syndrome. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the administration of non-invasive VNS using gammaCore®, during and following severe&#xD;
      infection with CoViD-19 may prevent the worsening inflammatory response and acute injury&#xD;
      associated, thus decreasing ventilator dependence and mortality of the virus. If utilized&#xD;
      early enough in the course of disease the investigators hope to reduce ventilator dependence&#xD;
      and improve survival with a scientifically driven safe and cost-effective approach.&#xD;
      Furthermore, through additional acute utility of gammaCore® (nVNS) in cases of ARDS and&#xD;
      cytokine storm the investigators can effectively blunt the pro inflammatory response, reduce&#xD;
      mortality and liberate patients from mechanical ventilation earlier which will assist in&#xD;
      deploying the ventilator to other patients in need during the CoViD-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      electroCore has designed a non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) device called&#xD;
      gammaCore®. The gammaCore® (nVNS) device is a handheld, battery-powered unit that produces a&#xD;
      proprietary electrical waveform in the vicinity of the vagus nerve in the neck. Each&#xD;
      treatment, or dose, is relatively brief (120 seconds) and the user maintains control over the&#xD;
      stimulation intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      gammaCore® is currently commercially available for the treatment of cluster and migraine&#xD;
      headaches, and broad safety data with thousands of patients treated in the US Europe and the&#xD;
      UK in both clinical trials and routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment paradigms have been developed and tested in clinical trials to support FDA&#xD;
      clearance for the acute treatment of pain associated with episodic cluster and migraine&#xD;
      headaches, and the prevention of cluster and migraine headache. This experience demonstrates&#xD;
      that nVNS may be administered safely in up to 24 two-minute doses per day. The investigators&#xD;
      thus have data to draw on as to how to effectively stimulate the vagus nerve. Given the&#xD;
      multiple modes of action with blocking the CAP, and acute bronchodilatation, using a similar&#xD;
      treatment paradigm for a trial to evaluate nVNS treatment of ARDS is reasonable. The device&#xD;
      should be used both prophylactically and acutely early in the course of the disease prior to&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, and once trained, treatment can be fully managed by either a&#xD;
      healthcare professional or the patient. If one waits until mechanical ventilation has&#xD;
      started, it is less likely that a therapy will be able to block the cytokine storm and&#xD;
      outcomes will be less profound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to the theoretical cardiac and respiratory side effects of non-invasive&#xD;
      treatment, historically, stimulation of the vagus nerve is associated with adverse side&#xD;
      effects, including bradycardia and bronchoconstriction. These effects were shown to be the&#xD;
      result of in discriminant stimulation of all fibers in the vagal bundle (the vagus nerve is&#xD;
      primarily comprised of A and C fibers), which could be avoided by specifically tuning the&#xD;
      electrical signals to selectively stimulate only the A fibers. This is possible because of&#xD;
      the difference in electric field strengths necessary to activate the different fiber types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity, pulse duration and frequency of gammaCore® (nVNS) stimulation parameters have&#xD;
      been optimized to induce signals in the large, myelinated Aβ fibers of the cervical branch of&#xD;
      the vagus nerve. Since gammaCore® activates only the low threshold afferent Aβ fibers, versus&#xD;
      the high threshold efferent C-fibers that innervate the heart, there is no known risk for&#xD;
      adverse cardiac or other systemic parasympathetic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      electroCore has conducted pre-clinical studies to assess the potential risk of vagus nerve&#xD;
      over-stimulation on the heart and airways. Several studies were conducted in beagle dogs with&#xD;
      hypersensitized airways (worst case for airway reactivity) at maximum stimulation output for&#xD;
      2 minutes. Review of heart rate and airway resistance before, during and after stimulation&#xD;
      indicated that there were no significant adverse changes associated with stimulation. These&#xD;
      results are consistent with the human clinical experience with the gammaCore® device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the theorized mechanism of action, afferent fibers from the vagus nerve enter the&#xD;
      brain and synapse onto the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brain stem , making&#xD;
      connections with many structures in the brain including the locus coeruleus (LC), the&#xD;
      periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the raphe nucleus (RN). These structures are known to control&#xD;
      the release of key inhibitory neurotransmitters. Numerous animal and clinical studies over&#xD;
      the last 25 years have implicated the activity of these structures, in particular the LC, in&#xD;
      the mechanism of action of VNS to inhibit seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Use for Clinical Care - Given the lack of other effective and/or reasonable options&#xD;
      for a patient with CoViD-19 respiratory distress and the anticipated demands on our&#xD;
      healthcare system, considering gammaCore® (nVNS) therapy, the investigators propose, is a&#xD;
      reasonable approach. To achieve goal of decreasing health care burden with patient benefit of&#xD;
      decreasing ventilator dependency, inflammatory response and mortality, plan to use it early&#xD;
      in course of disease i.e. prior to severe respiratory distress and the need for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presumptive mechanisms of bronchodilatation and modulation of the cytokine storm would&#xD;
      suggest that early intervention is ideal in improving pulmonary function and avoiding&#xD;
      respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevention. Mitigation of pro-inflammatory immunokine release would be best achieved&#xD;
           with two doses, consisting of a two-minute stimulation, on each side of the neck three&#xD;
           times a day (am, afternoon and an hour before bed). This would be a total of 6&#xD;
           treatments (2 stimulations x 3 times per day) of stimulation as a&#xD;
           prophylactic/preventive measure. This dosage is well below the known safety dosage&#xD;
           threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In addition, patients may receive additional treatments when experiencing acute&#xD;
           respiratory distress. Similarly, one treatment is two doses. Each treatment (a&#xD;
           two-minute stimulation on each side of the neck) is performed on the neck. If shortness&#xD;
           of breath (SOB) persists 20 minutes after start of first treatment, administer a second&#xD;
           treatment. Maximum number of treatments per day is 9. This is symptomatic control and&#xD;
           can be used to improve FEV1, Work of Breathing or dyspnea.&#xD;
