      This study evaluates the effects of the Survivorship Wellness Group Program following active&#xD;
      treatment, as well as to learn from Survivorship Wellness participants about their concerns&#xD;
      regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study may help to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      survivorship program on patient well-being, provide evidence for use in grant application and&#xD;
      publications, and ultimately inform the continued improvement of survivorship care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing an interdisciplinary&#xD;
           goal-setting clinical group program focused on domains of physical, psychological, and&#xD;
           spiritual wellness for survivors of cancer at University of California San Francisco&#xD;
           (UCSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine preliminary efficacy of the Survivorship Wellness intervention in regards&#xD;
           to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Increasing knowledge of and perceived confidence in execution of health behavior&#xD;
                changes in domains of physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness for survivors of&#xD;
                cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Increasing quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Increasing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess differences in patient wellbeing and in the impact of the Survivorship&#xD;
           Wellness program during the period of COVID-19 and telehealth classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete surveys over 5-10 minutes at baseline (i.e. before participating in the&#xD;
      program), and at 9 and 15 weeks follow up on the impact of COVID-19 on survivorship. Patients&#xD;
      also complete a survey assessing how patients rate telehealth classes in the Survivorship&#xD;
      Wellness program.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety Short Form over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9, and Week 15, up to 15 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Anxiety Short form consists of 2 items addressing patient anxiety with item response scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (Always). Raw scores are converted to scaled T-scores with higher scores indicating a greater level of anxiety. Significant changes over time and trends in patient reported outcomes will be analyzed via student's T-test.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9, and Week 15, up to 15 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Depression Short form consists of 4 items addressing patient depression with item response scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (Always). Raw scores are converted to scaled T-scores with higher scores indicating a greater level of depression. Significant changes over time and trends in patient reported outcomes will be analyzed via student's T-test.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9, and Week 15, up to 15 weeks total</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G is a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of health related quality of life (HRQOL) in cancer patients with 4 domains of interest: Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Each tem response score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The total score is a sum of the subscale scores, with a range from 0 - 108. The higher the score, the better the HRQOL.</description>
