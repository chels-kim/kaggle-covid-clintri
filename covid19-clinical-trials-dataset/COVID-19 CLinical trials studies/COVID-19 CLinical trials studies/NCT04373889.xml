    <textblock>
      Due to the situation this study, originally planted until September 2020, was extended with 7&#xD;
      months until April 2021. This extension was approved by the ethical committee University&#xD;
      hospital Ghent, Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus type 2) is&#xD;
      rapidly spreading over the world causing a condition called Coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19). Hospital health care workers (HCW) have received detailed instructions to protect&#xD;
      themselves against this infection, but it is likely that at least some of the HCW will get&#xD;
      infected either at their workplace or elsewhere. It would be useful to document prevalence&#xD;
      and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and their monthly evolution among Belgian active hospital&#xD;
      HCW during a period of 12 months starting beginning of April 2020 and the number of new cases&#xD;
      (incidence) of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 seroconversions among Belgian hospital HCW during a&#xD;
      period of 12 months which are the primary objectives of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the study will validate serological tests (subject to change/addition depending&#xD;
      on the evolution of scientific research) against the plaque reduction neutralization test&#xD;
      (PRNT) (gold standard); validate the saliva sample (sampling with Oracol or equivalent)&#xD;
      against the standard naso/oro pharyngeal swabbing (NOPS) to perform RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      diagnostic purposes, as well as against the standard serology (serum); validate the nasal&#xD;
      swab against the standard (NOPS) to perform RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic purposes;&#xD;
      investigate potential risk factors for the infection; quantify the proportion of asymptomatic&#xD;
      cases among new cases that develop during a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach these primary and secondary objectives the researchers will conduct a prospective&#xD;
      cohort study in which a random selection of HCW currently working in Belgian hospitals will&#xD;
      be tested monthly (with for the first month an additional testing point at 14 days). The&#xD;
      testing will include four kind of laboratory tests, being; a molecular (PCR) test on a&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal, a saliva and nasal sample (for nasal and saliva sample only testing until 50&#xD;
      PCR positive and 50 PCR negative samples are collected) and a serological test for which a&#xD;
      blood sample is needed. To asses risk factors, at each testing point a questionnaire&#xD;
      providing basic socio-demographic and health characteristics of the HCW including presence of&#xD;
      symptoms since the previous testing point and the HCW's involvement in caring for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data and epidemiological data (questionnaire) will be collected simultaneously. In&#xD;
      each of the participating hospitals, one contact person will be designated to coordinate the&#xD;
      study locally (ideally a staff member of the local infection and prevention control team) and&#xD;
      communicate with the researchers. The sample size calculation indicated the inclusion of 17&#xD;
      randomly selected Belgian hospitals and in each hospital 50 randomly selected HCW. HCW can&#xD;
      only be enrolled in the study after give a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing will be performed at the Virology Diseases and Immune Response services of&#xD;
      Sciensano, Ukkel, and the Virology Laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.&#xD;
      The laboratory test results will be communicated by the laboratory to each participant. Each&#xD;
      participant and sample will have a unique code assigned. Data collected through the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be send psuedonymised (using the unique code) to the epidemiologist at&#xD;
      Sciensano. The laboratory will prepare a list of test results by unique code to be linked for&#xD;
      further analysis with the questionnaire data. None of the researchers who will analyse the&#xD;
      data will be involved in data collection, nor in the care of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Belgian multicentric study executed by Sciensano, Brussels, in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.&#xD;

    <description>For serological analyses, the &quot;background&quot; serological positivity of the HCW to various CoV will be tested in order to have a clear view on true seroconversions. Antibody titers (IgM/IgG) against SARS-CoV-2; HKU-1 and OC-43 as well as 229-E and NL-63 will be determined in order to assess specificity and document potential seroconversion. Furthermore, the presently available serological tests need to be validated and confirmed with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). To that end researchers will use a Vero cell-based in vitro virus neutralization test.</description>

        Study population include health care workers currently working in Belgian hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        According to current national guidelines, HCW in contact with persons at risk for COVID-19&#xD;
        experiencing mild respiratory symptoms without fever are allowed to work if clinical&#xD;
        condition permits, while wearing a mask and observing usual hygiene measures. Healthcare&#xD;
        workers experiencing respiratory symptoms and fever are systematically tested and if&#xD;
        positive, isolated at home, if negative, eventually working wearing a mask if the clinical&#xD;
        state allows it. Those who recovered from a documented infection are also allowed to work.&#xD;
        HCW who are not in contact with persons at risk for COVID-19 are not tested and&#xD;
        systematically isolated in case of any unusual respiratory symptom. This implies that at&#xD;
        baseline, the study population will only include asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic HCW&#xD;
        applying proper infection prevention measures.&#xD;
