      Background: Reminding people they are moral adaptable human beings (&quot;self-affirming&quot;) reduces&#xD;
      the perceived stigma associated with wearing hearing aids and increases actual hearing aid&#xD;
      use. The proposed study aims to reduce stigma in a representative sample of people aged over&#xD;
      60 from the general population who may or may not already be wearing hearing aids and improve&#xD;
      multiple hearing health outcomes (e.g., attending screening, device use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: Double-blinded randomized controlled trial in which a representative sample&#xD;
      of people aged over 60 from the general population will be asked to complete surveys about&#xD;
      hearing stigma, hearing loss and multiple hearing health outcomes. Participants randomized to&#xD;
      the control group will only complete the survey; participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      be asked to affirm their values. Six months later, all participants will complete the same&#xD;
      survey to assess outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The proposed research will lead to a brief psychological intervention to reduce&#xD;
      stigma in relation to hearing loss/aids.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to self-affirmation theory, defensiveness arises because people are motivated to&#xD;
      defend their global sense of self-worth, which in the present case is threatened by&#xD;
      perceptions of hearing aids/loss. However, if a person's self-image can be bolstered&#xD;
      (affirmed) in a domain that is important to them, thereby preserving self-integrity, the&#xD;
      individual should be less likely to process the threatening (i.e., stigmatizing in the&#xD;
      present context) information defensively. Accumulated empirical evidence demonstrates that&#xD;
      affirming the self: (a) reduces public stigma, (b) reduces self-stigma, and (c) causes&#xD;
      meaningful changes in behaviour. Following a pilot-feasibility trial showing that&#xD;
      self-affirming caused significant reductions in first-time hearing aid users' anxieties about&#xD;
      ageing and increased their hearing aid use by almost 2 hours/day.&#xD;
