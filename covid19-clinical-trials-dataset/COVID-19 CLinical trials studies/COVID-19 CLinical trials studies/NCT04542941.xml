  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no proven treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 and care of the COVID&#xD;
      patients is largely supportive involving treatment of symptoms such as fever with&#xD;
      antipyretics, secondary bacterial chest infection with antibiotics and meticulous management&#xD;
      of comorbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several repurposed and new drugs have been investigated for treatment of COVID-19, however,&#xD;
      none have been confirmed to be efficacious. These drugs include the antimalarials&#xD;
      (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir and&#xD;
      antiretroviral combination therapies such lopinavir/ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is emerging evidence to support the use of COVID convalescent plasma for the treatment&#xD;
      of COVID-19. There is need to leverage the blood transfusion services in countries and this&#xD;
      is beginning to happen on the continent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no proven treatments for COVID-19 and current standard therapy is&#xD;
      supportive care with oxygen supplementation and treatment of symptoms. While treatments are&#xD;
      being investigated in the Western world, it is likely that these data will take several&#xD;
      months to become available and if proven to be efficacious, access in most of the low-income&#xD;
      countries will be limited due to the high global demand and exorbitant costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the safety and efficacy of use of CCP for&#xD;
      treatment of adults with COVID-19 in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that administration of CCP to patients with positive SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      RT PCR leads to earlier time to viral clearance compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective The overall objective of this project is to assess the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the efficacy of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma, as measured by time to RT-PCR&#xD;
      negativity of COVID-19 patients treated with COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in the treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
           patients in Uganda&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To document the time to symptom decrease of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR&#xD;
           treated with CCP compared to those on standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the ability of CCP therapy to stop progression to severe/critical forms of&#xD;
           disease This study will be a prospective randomized two arm open label clinical trial.&#xD;
           Patients with confirmed COVID-19 who meet the study eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
           randomized to receive either CCP in addition to standard of care therapy or standard of&#xD;
           care therapy alone.&#xD;
