    <textblock>
      Endoscopic methods are frequently used in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal system&#xD;
      pathologies in children. In the investigators' center, which is a pandemic hospital, only&#xD;
      emergency endoscopic procedures were performed during the pandemic period, while emergency&#xD;
      and elective endoscopic procedures are performed in accordance with the recommendations of&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health during the normalization process. Staff and patients in endoscopy&#xD;
      units are at risk for COVID-19 infection by inhalation of airborne droplets, conjunctival&#xD;
      contact, and potential fecal-oral contamination. In order to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      contamination, according to the recommendations of the European Gastrointestinal Endoscopy&#xD;
      Association (ESGE); proper cleaning of endoscopic devices, non-reuse of disposable devices,&#xD;
      cleaning the endoscopy hall with a disinfectant solution, use of gowns FFP2 / 3 masks and&#xD;
      jewelry during the procedure, handwashing with soap and hand disinfection is recommended&#xD;
      before and after each procedure. In addition, it is recommended that patients who have&#xD;
      undergone endoscopic procedures should be followed up or communicated on days 7 and 14 in&#xD;
      terms of the development of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that patients should be questioned in terms of COVID-19 infection before&#xD;
      endoscopy, but rapid antigen testing and serology are not routinely recommended. Molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis (PCR, amplification) tests are recommended for patients at risk for COVID-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

        Patients aged 1 to 18 years who underwent emergency or elective endoscopic procedures will&#xD;
        be included in the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients, indication of the&#xD;
        procedure, date, place of operation, procedure performed and endoscopic diagnosis will be&#xD;
        noted. Before and on the 7th and 14th days after the procedure, patients will be contacted&#xD;
        and the symptoms and clinical findings in terms of COVID-19 infection will be questioned&#xD;
        and noted. The results of complete blood count, CRP, coagulation profile, COVID-19 PCR,&#xD;
        chest radiography and thorax computed tomography will be recorded if it was performed on&#xD;
        the patient.&#xD;
