      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers think that people s mental health and behavior will be very affected by the steps&#xD;
      taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing. Also, the threat of disease&#xD;
      and death, to people and their loved ones, can cause much stress. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      more about these stressors and how they are affecting people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the relationship of affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to stressors&#xD;
      related to COVID-19 with neuroimaging and behavioral data collected before COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults age 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This online study will include both new participants and those who have taken part in past&#xD;
      National Institute of Mental Health studies. All will complete the same surveys and tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give their name and email address. They will get a username and password.&#xD;
      The file that links their username to their personal data will be kept secure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a set of surveys about the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic data, such age, race, and income&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education and work status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental and medical illness and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID-19 experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substance and alcohol use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attention control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other mental health related topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a finger-tapping task. For this, they will press a key a certain&#xD;
      number of times in a limited period. They will get to practice the task. After the task, they&#xD;
      will complete a survey about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take about 1 hour to complete the surveys and the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 8 months later, participants will be contacted to repeat the surveys and task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation is provided.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has 2 goals: (1) Collect data from NIMH research volunteers who already&#xD;
      participated in SNFA neuroimaging studies (protocol 02-M-0321,and 14-M-0114) and examine how&#xD;
      individual affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to COVID-19 can be predicted by&#xD;
      neural and clinical measures obtained prior to the pandemic. This part-1 concerns only a&#xD;
      limited number of adults and represents a unique opportunity to probe critical questions&#xD;
      which are difficult to query in empirical experiments or with only retrospective information&#xD;
      on stress experience. (2) Collect a large dataset to examine the impact of COVID-19 stressors&#xD;
      on motivation pattern (approach/avoidance behavior) in function of anxiety, cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral responses to the pandemic. This part-2 of the protocol is open to any individuals&#xD;
      interested in participating. Overall, this is a time-sensitive research on the impact of&#xD;
      environmental stressors generated by the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, motivation and&#xD;
      potential neural mechanisms informed by predictors. Measures collected consist of ratings of&#xD;
      stressors related to COVID-19 and more generally, anxiety, cognition, and behavior, including&#xD;
      the performance of a motivation-based task (finger-pressing task). and an attention bias task&#xD;
      (dot-probe task). This research will use a study website to consent, survey participants&#xD;
      online, and tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to examine the relationship of affective, cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      responses to stressors related to COVID-19 with neuroimaging and behavioral data collected&#xD;
      previously, before COVID-19. This research will identify risk and resilience factors (neural&#xD;
      and behavioral) among study participants regarding their responses to COVID-19 crisis. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to gather a large dataset to provide information on how sustained&#xD;
      environmental stress affect motivated behavior, particularly with respect to biasing behavior&#xD;
      towards avoidance, and how individual factors such as anxiety and cognitive function&#xD;
      influence the impact on patterns of motivation. These data are expected to help the&#xD;
      interpretation of the role of neuroimaging findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoints are 2-fold: anxiety and motivation pattern responses to COVID-19 stressors (1)&#xD;
      in function of clinical phenotype; and (2) in function of endophenotype previously collected&#xD;
      using high-resolution 7T fMRI. These endpoints will be measured twice using the same online&#xD;
      platform approximately 14-20 months after the start of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be up to 5000 healthy volunteers and anxiety participants. Participants&#xD;
      will be males and females, 18 years and older. They must be English-speaking. The study&#xD;
      population will include patient and volunteer participants who have consented for an SFNA&#xD;
      study in the past (protocols 01-M-0185, 02-M-0321, 03-M-0093 and 14-M-0114), or NIMH healthy&#xD;
      volunteer study (17-M-0181) as well as new participants from the general population who&#xD;
      respond to advertisements for the SNFA -COVID study but who have not previously been a NIMH&#xD;
      study participant. The SNFA -COVID study study participants may or may not be local to the&#xD;
      Metropolitan Washington DC area but since the study will be conducted entirely online, this&#xD;
      is not relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is situated at the NIH Clinical Center with no additional supporting sites. The&#xD;
      study itself will be conducted entirely online through a secure study website where consent&#xD;
      and study measures will be completed and repeated as specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no study interventions as this is a descriptive behavioral health survey study,&#xD;
      including questionnaires and computer tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated time from study initiation to study completion approximately three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that participants will participate in the study for up to 14-20 months with an&#xD;
      option to recontact in the future.&#xD;
