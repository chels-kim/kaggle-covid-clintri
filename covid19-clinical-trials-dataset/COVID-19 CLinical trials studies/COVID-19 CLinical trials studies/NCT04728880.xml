      COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and causes&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. This study is a retrospective trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of Remdesivir in adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Mansoura University&#xD;
      Isolation Hospital. In this study the investigators will analyze the data collected during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a novel respiratory disease caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and results in&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. To date there is no approved medication for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide&#xD;
      analogue that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity among a diverse group of RNA&#xD;
      viruses. Non-clinical and clinical data suggest that Remdesivir may be useful for the&#xD;
      treatment of COVID-19. WHO has identified Remdesivir as a candidate drug of interest to be&#xD;
      studied in clinical trials. This retrospective study is designed to analyze the data&#xD;
      collected during the routine care of patients who have benefited from this therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) is a morbidity severity score and mortality estimation tool. It allows for calculation of both the number and the severity of organ dysfunction in six organ systems (respiratory, coagulatory, liver, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic). The following values are used to calculate the score: (PaO2 / FiO2 and artificial ventilation; platelets; bilirubin; average blood pressure and use of vasoactive drugs; creatinine).The total score ranges from 0-24. Zero indicates low risk while 24 indicates higher risk of mortality.</description>
