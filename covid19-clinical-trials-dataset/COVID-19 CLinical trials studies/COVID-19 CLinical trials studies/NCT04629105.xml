      A Phase I, double- blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled study to test the safety of LMSCs&#xD;
      in Adults suffering from mild to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 resultant from 2019-nCoV coronavirus infection, or resultant from influenza virus&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study with 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Subjects with ARDS and acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2. Arm 1: 25 subjects treated&#xD;
      with up to 3 doses of 100 million LMSCs. Arm 2: 10 subjects treated with up to 3 doses of&#xD;
      Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Subjects with ARDS and acutely infected with influenza virus. Arm 3: 25 subjects&#xD;
      treated with up to 3 doses of 100 million LMSCs. Arm 4: 10 subjects treated with up to 3&#xD;
      doses of Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be intravenously infused with 100 million LMSCs or placebo on Day 0. If no&#xD;
      treatment-related AEs are seen after the infusion, a second infusion will be given on Day 3.&#xD;
      If no treatment-related AEs are seen after the second infusion, a third infusion will be&#xD;
      given Day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be conducted: daily until hospital discharge; at Week 4 after treatment&#xD;
      (with LMSCs or placebo) for patients already discharged; and at Month 6 after treatment (with&#xD;
      LMSCs or placebo).&#xD;

             participated in an investigational therapeutic or device trial within the previous 30&#xD;
             days, or participate in any other clinical trial for the duration of the time that the&#xD;
             subject actively participates in this trial. However, use of hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
             remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and ivermectin are allowed as well as convalescent&#xD;
             plasma.. Exceptions for other experimental interventions related to treating the&#xD;
