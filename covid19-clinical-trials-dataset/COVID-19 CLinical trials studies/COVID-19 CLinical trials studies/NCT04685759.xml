  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of exercise therapy for patients&#xD;
      undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer, providing&#xD;
      a reproducible exercise regimen designed to improve or preserve aerobic fitness, strength,&#xD;
      and quality of life. In addition, this study will address shifts in healthcare delivery&#xD;
      needed as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of telehealth instruction as a method for exercise therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise therapy for cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
           neoadjuvant treatment when delivered via telehealth, as compared to an in-person&#xD;
           setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess stair test instrumentation, previously validated in a healthy population, as a&#xD;
           measure to gauge health status in cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess patient satisfaction with exercise therapy when delivered via telehealth, as&#xD;
           compared to an in-person setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks and benefits, all patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria who provide written informed consent will be randomized at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment to one of two cohorts engaged in a standardized exercise regimen based on delivery&#xD;
      method, either in-person or via telehealth. Patient function will be assessed using the Timed&#xD;
      Up and Go (TUG) test; Stairs Test; which evaluates aerobic ability, resistance, agility,&#xD;
      balance, and posture; and given a score on the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. Patient&#xD;
      quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General&#xD;
      (FACT-G) survey. Outcomes for the cohorts will be compared over time.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient function as measured by Karnosfky Performance Status Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline prior to initial exercise therapy session, midpoint(at 12 sessions), neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion prior to surgery, and 30 days post-operative surgery for tumor removal.</time_frame>
    <description>The Karnosfky Performance Status Scale measures the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks. Possible scores range from 0 to 100 by increments of 10, with higher scores indicating that patients are better able to carry out daily activities.&#xD;
Patient function will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Stairs Test, which evaluate patient's aerobic ability, resistance, agility, balance, and posture, as well as the Karnosfky Performance Status Scale. Patient quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) survey. All assessments will be completed at baseline, prior to the initial exercise therapy session, at midpoint, and at the final session prior to surgery, as well as 30 days post-surgery. Exercise therapy will be deemed effective by preventing a reduction to patient function and quality of life over the course of enrollment in the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean total Patient Satisfaction score of Telehealth Exercise Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after administration of each exercise session</time_frame>
    <description>The Virtual Exercise Protocol Satisfaction Survey Scale (VEPSS1) measures patient satisfaction with the service delivery method of the exercise intervention. This is a researcher-designed survey for use in this study. Possible scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. The VEPSS1 will be used for telehealth cohort only.&#xD;
Satisfaction will be summarize as a continuous score for the participant populations. Median and interquartile ranges of the score will be recorded. Differences in comprehension will be measured between the In-Person Exercise Protocol Satisfaction Survey Scale and the VEPSS1.</description>

    <description>The In-Person Exercise Protocol Satisfaction Survey Scale (IPEPSS1) measures patient satisfaction with the in-person service delivery method of the exercise intervention. This is a researcher-designed survey for use in this study. Possible scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. The IPEPSS1 will be used for in-person exercise cohort only.&#xD;
Satisfaction will be summarize as a continuous score for the participant populations. Median and interquartile ranges of the score will be recorded. Differences in comprehension will be measured between the IPEPSS1 and the VEPSS1.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline prior to initial exercise therapy session, midpoint(at 12 sessions), neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion prior to surgery, and 30 days post-operative surgery for tumor removal.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) survey measures patient quality of life. This validated survey contains 27 items measured by a 5 point Likert-type scale in 4 domains relevant to cancer patients: Physical, Social, Emotional, and Functional well-being.&#xD;
Possible scores range from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The mean change in Stair Test assessment score</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at individual patient completion of the exercise protocol (at about Week 12 through Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stair Test is a validated measurement to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness. This test has been previously validated in a healthy population. To then validate as a measure to gauge health status in cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment, results will be compared to those collected in Timed Up and Go test, where the total score or scores will then be used to determine the measure of agreement using the Concordance Correlation Coefficient.&#xD;
Patients in both study cohorts will be evaluated in person. The score range will be determined for each participant and compared to all participants in order to validate the test in this population. Scores will be calculated based on age, Body Mass Index (BMI), time of the stair climb in seconds (CT), and heart rate at the end of the climb (HRend, in beatsâ€¢min-1).</description>
