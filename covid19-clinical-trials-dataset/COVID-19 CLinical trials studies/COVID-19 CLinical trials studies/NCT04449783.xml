      trial to assess the effectiveness of pre-operative screening for COVID-19 in patients&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The optimal method of screening patients for COVID infection before elective cancer&#xD;
           surgery is unclear. Provisional data from the international COVIDsurg audit as well as a&#xD;
           similar study from China has shown mortality rates of in excess of 20% for COVID +ve&#xD;
           patients undergoing surgery and so ensuring patients do not have infection before&#xD;
           surgery is critical (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current practice for the preoperative screening of elective surgical patients involves a&#xD;
           period of self-isolation, assessment of self-reported symptoms and nose and throat swab&#xD;
           testing. Many patients are asymptomatic with COVID and the false negative rate of RT-PCR&#xD;
           nose and throat swabs may be as high as 30% (2,3). Furthermore, we do not know how&#xD;
           effective our strategy is at preventing hospital acquired COVID in the days after&#xD;
           surgery. Patients are currently going to designated clean (silver) wards postoperatively&#xD;
           to reduce this risk with other patient who have tested negatively to the above screening&#xD;
           process too&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the rate of perioperative COVID in elective surgical&#xD;
      patients, and to assess whether RT-PCR swabbing adds any additional value i.e. does it detect&#xD;
      clinically important asymptomatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If asymptomatic patients are diagnosed preoperatively this will reduce perioperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality as well as confirming this as an appropriate preoperative screening&#xD;
      process. Alternatively, should nose and throat swabbing not improve the diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      in asymptomatic patients this trial may stop unnecessary visit to the hospital where they may&#xD;
      be more likely to contract COVID-19 and reduce the use of a limited resource.&#xD;
