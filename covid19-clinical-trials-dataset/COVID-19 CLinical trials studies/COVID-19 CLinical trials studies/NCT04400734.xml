  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease COVID-19 has been classified as pandemic by World Health Organisation (WHO) in&#xD;
      March 2020. This poses a risk to healthcare workers. Whether esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)&#xD;
      is a aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) has brought controversy. Multiple international&#xD;
      guidelines consider EGD as AGP based on expert consensus. No scientific data has been&#xD;
      published regarding this. With a commercially available particle counter, we can&#xD;
      differentiate the particle counts of different sizes in different areas of the endoscopy&#xD;
      room. An increase from baseline particles of &lt; 5um during or after the procedure would&#xD;
      suggest that the procedure is an AGP. The baseline particle counts before and during the&#xD;
      procedure are also recorded. The details of the procedure including procedure time and the&#xD;
      use of sedation are also documented.&#xD;

      The disease COVID-19 has been classified as pandemic by World Health Organisation (WHO) in&#xD;
      March 2020. This poses a risk to healthcare workers. Whether esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)&#xD;
      is a aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) has brought controversy. Multiple international&#xD;
      guidelines consider EGD as AGP based on expert consensus. No scientific data has been&#xD;
      published regarding this. Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets &gt;5&#xD;
      microns (μm) in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are&#xD;
      transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei&#xD;
      refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods&#xD;
      of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances &gt;1 metre. With a commercially&#xD;
      available particle counter, we can differentiate the particle counts of different sizes in&#xD;
      different areas of the endoscopy room. An increase from baseline particles of &lt; 5um during or&#xD;
      after the procedure would suggest that the procedure is an AGP. With the use of a commercial&#xD;
      available particle counter, the number of particles of size (0.3um, 0.5um, 0.7um, 1um, 5um&#xD;
      and 1um) are recorded. The baseline particle counts before and during the procedure are also&#xD;
      recorded. The details of the procedure including procedure time and the use of sedation are&#xD;
      also documented.&#xD;
