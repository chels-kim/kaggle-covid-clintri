  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reports of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) associated with COVID-19 have emerged in the&#xD;
      literature. For example, Chen et al. described 25 pulmonary CT angiograms examinations from&#xD;
      1008 COVID-19 patients; 10 were positive for pulmonary embolism mostly as segmental or&#xD;
      sub-segmental APE. Case reports of APE in Covid-19 patients have been published. Cui et al.&#xD;
      found an incidence of deep venous thrombosis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with&#xD;
      severe Covid-19 pneumonia near to 25% (20/81), however without any correlation with potential&#xD;
      APE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these initial reports, it is not clear whether APE is more frequent in Covid-19&#xD;
      patients or if the association is just random. In favor of the former, D-dimer levels have&#xD;
      been reported as elevated in patients with Covid-19 by two studies, and it has been suggested&#xD;
      an independent association between the severity of the disease and the level of D-dimer.&#xD;
      Finally, Tang et al. showed that anticoagulant therapy is associated with a decreased&#xD;
      mortality at Day-28 in severe Covid-19 patients, in favor of a possible associated&#xD;
      coagulopathy. The purpose of this study is to describe the rate of pulmonary embolus in&#xD;
      patients classified as COVID-19 infection and who underwent chest CT angiography.&#xD;
