    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase III study is to confirm that SNG001 can accelerate the recovery of&#xD;
      hospitalised patients receiving oxygen with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Safety and other efficacy endpoints will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive virus test and who are&#xD;
      hospitalised due to COVID-19 and require oxygen therapy, will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive SNG001 two syringes or placebo two syringes. SNG001 or placebo will be administered&#xD;
      via the Ultra nebuliser. Patients will receive a dose of SNG001 or placebo once a day for 14&#xD;
      days and will be followed up for up to 90 days after completion of study medication. Study&#xD;
      data will be collected from patients daily, as per the study schedule.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to hospital discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 until Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the time to hospital discharge in patients with moderate COVID-19 after administration of SNG001 compared to placebo. Here, hospital discharge can be considered when Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) score of 2 (limitation of activities) or below, with no rebound at subsequent assessments. Improvement in clinical status is based on the 9-point OSCI score.

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of SNG001 compared to placebo in patients with moderate COVID-19 by using EQ-5D-5L. The EQ-5D-5L provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D-5L self-rated questionnaire includes a visual analogue scale, which records the respondent's self-rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, with higher scores for higher health-related quality of life. It also includes the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, which comprises 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The responses record five levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Here, 100 means the best health and 0 means the worst health. The mobility, self-care and usual activities dimensions of the questionnaire will be assessed daily from Day 1 to Day 35.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted to hospital due to the severity of their COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive virus test for SARS-CoV-2 using a validated molecular assay or antigen assay.&#xD;
             Patients who had positive virus test for SARS-CoV-2 prior to hospitalisation will be&#xD;
             randomised no later than 48 hours after hospital admission. If the virus test was&#xD;
             performed more than 96 hours prior to hospitalisation, the test will have to be&#xD;
             repeated in the hospital prior to randomisation. Only patients whose repeated virus&#xD;
             test is positive will be randomised, no later than 48 hours after confirmation of&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who had positive virus test for SARS-CoV-2 after&#xD;
             hospitalisation will be randomised no later than 48 hours after confirmation of&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Require oxygen therapy via nasal prongs or mask (OSCI score of 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provided informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be ≥1 year post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using a&#xD;
             protocol defined highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women should have been stable on their chosen method of birth control for a minimum of&#xD;
             3 months before entering the trial and should continue with birth control for 1 month&#xD;
             after the last dose of inhaled interferon-β (IFN-β1a)/matching placebo. In addition to&#xD;
             the highly effective method of contraception (except for the practice of total sexual&#xD;
             abstinence), a condom (in United Kingdom with spermicides) should be used by the male&#xD;
             partner for sexual intercourse from randomisation (Visit 2) and for 1 month after the&#xD;
             last dose of inhaled IFN-β1a/matching placebo to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently&#xD;
             sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who&#xD;
             are postmenopausal. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. The following age specific requirements apply: women &lt;50&#xD;
             years old will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12&#xD;
             months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and if follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are in the postmenopausal range; women ≥50 years old&#xD;
             will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or&#xD;
             more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment. If, in the setting of&#xD;
             the pandemic, the use of an acceptable birth control method is not possible, the&#xD;
             decision to enrol a woman of childbearing potential should be based on the&#xD;
             benefit-risk for the patient, which should be discussed with the patient at the time&#xD;
             of the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
