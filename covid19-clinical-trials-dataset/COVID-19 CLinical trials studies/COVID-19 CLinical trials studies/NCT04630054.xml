  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the village-level intervention is to assess whether mask-wearing reduces&#xD;
      community-level COVID-19 seroconversion. The individual experiment assess whether masks&#xD;
      protect against COVID-19 seroconversion. It also assesses the efficacy of high-quality cloth&#xD;
      vs. surgical masks.&#xD;

      This study intends to answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can mask distribution and mask promotion at homes, mosques, markets and other public areas&#xD;
      successfully change community mask-wearing norms to increase mask-wearing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can community mask-wearing reduce COVID-19 seroconversions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can mask wearing reduce COVID-19 seroconversions for the wearer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are high-quality cloth or &quot;surgical&quot; masks more effective in reducing COVID-19&#xD;
      seroconversions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is increased prevalence of community-level mask-wearing associated with decreased physical&#xD;
      distancing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial which&#xD;
      randomizes the proposed intervention at the village level in Bangladesh, as well as a&#xD;
      separate trial where masks are randomized at the individual level among high-risk indoor&#xD;
      market vendors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the community experiment, control communities will receive no intervention and treatment&#xD;
      communities will receive an extensive intervention combining several elements. The&#xD;
      investigators will distribute free face masks through door-to-door visits and at markets and&#xD;
      mosques. Some communities will receive cloth masks and some will wear surgical masks&#xD;
      (cross-randomized among intervention communities). Mask promoters in the community and at&#xD;
      markets in treated villages will remind people about the importance of wearing masks and&#xD;
      distribute additional masks. Markets will have signs that masks need to be worn to enter the&#xD;
      market. Religious leaders will encourage mask use at religious services. Communities will&#xD;
      receive an incentive if &gt;75% are observed to wear masks by mask surveillance staff that&#xD;
      conduct discrete observations on days when mask promotion is and is not occurring. The&#xD;
      project will enroll 600 communities and create matched pairs based on population size; half&#xD;
      of which will be randomized to receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the individual experiment, the investigators will identify 5,000 high-risk individuals&#xD;
      (vendors at indoor market). and randomizing them at the individual level to receive our mask&#xD;
      intervention or not. In each indoor market, there will be both control and treatment&#xD;
      individuals. Individuals in the treatment arm will receive a free face mask (cloth or&#xD;
      surgical). Investigators will enroll individuals from 350-500 markets that are not in the&#xD;
      communities that are participating in the community experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communities will be surveilled at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks to assess mask wearing.&#xD;
      Participants in the indvidual experiment will be surveilled at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, weeks to assess&#xD;
      mask wearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both experiments, we will assess seroprevalence of COVID-19 at baseline and endline.&#xD;
      Endline is planned for 12 weeks after the intervention begins, but may be shifted according&#xD;
      to seroprevalence trends.&#xD;
