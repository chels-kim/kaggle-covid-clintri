    <textblock>
      In this study invetigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening COVID-19 infection manifest by pulmonary failure and a clinical picture&#xD;
      consistent with a cytokine storm syndrome. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in which 80 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a&#xD;
      1:1:1 ratio to three study arms and received clazakizumab at a dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on interim analysis, the remaining 10 subjects at NYU will be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to two arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo. The NYU&#xD;
      site will serve as the central data management site for other centers who undertake this&#xD;
      protocol. Other sites will enroll patients based on the two arm 1:1 randomization. 60&#xD;
      patients at outside sites are expected to enroll.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The limited understanding of the clinical behavior of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the&#xD;
      viral organism responsible for COVID-19 disease) is evolving on a daily basis. Reports from&#xD;
      China indicate that a subset of patients with the worst clinical outcomes may manifest&#xD;
      cytokine storm syndrome. Hypotheses that excess cytokines may trigger a secondary&#xD;
      hemophagocytic lymphhistiocytosis (sHLH) have been proposed. Indeed, cytokine profiles&#xD;
      consistent with this picture were observed in Chinese patients with severe pulmonary&#xD;
      involvement. Specifically, elevated ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were associated with&#xD;
      fatalities among the infected patients. A role for targeted anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-cytokine therapies in the treatment of pulmonary hyperinflammation has been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clazakizumab is a genetically engineered humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds&#xD;
      with high affinity to human IL-6. This investigational agent is currently being studied as a&#xD;
      treatment for chronic active antibody mediated rejection of renal allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening pulmonary failure secondary to COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive seamless Phase II/III design (ASD). We propose the administration of an investigational drug in patients with high predicted short-term mortality secondary to COVID-19 disease. 80 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to three study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg or placebo. Interim analyses have occurred every 7 days since the enrollment of the first 30 patients. Based on week 4 interim analysis the DSMB has recommendation discontinuing the low-dose 12.5 mg of clazakizumab arm. The DSMB has advised continuing enrollment in the placebo and high-dose 25mg of clazakizumab arms in a 1:1 randomization.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, the patients must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmed COVID-19 disease (by Cobas SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal&#xD;
             swab sample, or equivalent test available to be performed by the NYU Langone clinical&#xD;
             laboratory). Effort will be made to have the confirmatory test result &lt;72 hours prior&#xD;
             to enrollment however given overall clinical demand this may not be feasible in all&#xD;
             cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Respiratory failure manifesting as: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (defined by a&#xD;
             P/F ratio of &lt;200), OR SpO2 &lt; 90% on 4L (actual or expected given higher O2&#xD;
             requirement) OR increasing O2 requirements over 24 hours, PLUS 2 or more of the&#xD;
             following predictors for severe disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
             CRP &gt; 35 mg/L Ferritin &gt; 500 ng/mL D-dimer &gt; 1 mcg/L Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio &gt; 4&#xD;
             LDH &gt; 200 U/L Increase in troponin in patient w/out known cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a consent designee willing to provide informed consent on behalf of the patient&#xD;
             (this assumes that a mechanically ventilated patients lacks capacity to consent on&#xD;
             his/her own behalf. Should it be deemed that the patient has capacity to consent,&#xD;
             consent may be obtained from the patient.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of childbearing potential must be willing and able to use at least one highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method for a period of 5 months following the study drug&#xD;
             administration. In the context of this study, an effective method is defined as those&#xD;
             which result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently&#xD;
             and correctly such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception combined&#xD;
                  (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal,&#xD;
                  or transdermal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
                  (oral, injectable, implantable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. true abstinence. when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence, such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Men must be willing to use a double-barrier contraception from enrollment until at 5&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study drug, if not abstinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of irreversible injury deemed non-survivable even if the pulmonary failure&#xD;
             recovers (for example severe anoxic brain injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known active inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known active, untreated diverticulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known untreated bacteremia&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy. (The protocol will exclude pregnant subjects given the lack of overall data&#xD;
             on use of clazakizumab in pregnancy however the study team would consider a protocol&#xD;
             revision should more than 3 potential pregnant study subjects be excluded on this&#xD;
             basis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known hypersensitivity to the clazakizumab&#xD;
