  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are (1) to determine the ex vivo neutralizing capacity and the&#xD;
      longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab responses and (2) to measure the memory B-cell responses&#xD;
      in a cohort of health care workers (HCW) recovering from severe, mild or asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection. By focusing on HCW, a population that is at risk for re-infection during a second&#xD;
      epidemic wave, the correlation between nAb levels and protection is investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 has spread at an unprecedented speed and scale since January 2020. Since then,&#xD;
      Belgium has been confronted with &gt;60.000 diagnosed cases and likely many more undiagnosed&#xD;
      with mild or no symptoms. The true seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population is&#xD;
      not known, yet increasing confidence about the performance of several serological assays&#xD;
      paves the way to large-scale serosurveys. These studies will be crucial in assessing&#xD;
      population immunity and evaluating the risk of re-infection. The first, smaller-scaled,&#xD;
      antibody surveys report a range of seroprevalences, i.e. Germany (14%), The Netherlands (4%),&#xD;
      USA (2.49-4.16%) and Belgium (4.7-6.9%). These studies suffer from conceptual and technical&#xD;
      flaws yet are used for easing lockdown measures. A major limitation is that antibody (Ab)&#xD;
      capture assays measure exposure to SARS-CoV-2, rather than subsequent protection, which&#xD;
      requires assessment of the quality of the Abs including their capacity to neutralize the&#xD;
      virus. Also the Ab levels required for protection and their duration are yet unknown. The&#xD;
      proposed project aims to address these pertinent questions in a population at risk of&#xD;
      re-infection during a second epidemic wave. Sero-neutralisation assays are regarded the gold&#xD;
      standard method to measure ex vivo Ab neutralising activity against viruses, including&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. A recent Chinese study, using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay, found that nAbs&#xD;
      are detected from day 10-15 after onset of disease and that younger patients typically have&#xD;
      lower levels of nAbs compared to middle-aged and elderly patients. Importantly, in about 1&#xD;
      out of 3 patients the nAb titers were low and in 10 young patients nAbs were absent. A&#xD;
      pseudovirus is an imperfect model for SARS-CoV-2 because of the non-natural embedding of&#xD;
      Spike protein in the pseudovirions and differences in glycosylation. In this study, a whole&#xD;
      virus neutralisation assay will be used that was recently validated using a panel of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera in the lab of the Principal Investigator. Preliminary results of&#xD;
      the study team show a rapid decline in nAb titer within 15-36d after diagnosis in 4/11&#xD;
      patients, while IgG and IgA remain steady and high in ELISA. Older studies with SARS-CoV-1&#xD;
      showed declining IgM and IgA antibody titers within 6 months, declining IgG titers after 1y,&#xD;
      and a complete lack of antigen-specific peripheral memory B-cell (MBC) responses after&#xD;
      recovery. Measuring only circulating Abs can be misleading as it excludes the detection of&#xD;
      the MBC pool, which can exist in the absence of detectable serum Ab levels and is a&#xD;
      pre-requisite to maintain protective immunity in the long term. Upon re-encounter with the&#xD;
      antigen, MBC can rapidly differentiate to produce Abs. So far, little is known about humoral&#xD;
      immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and their contribution to protection.&#xD;
