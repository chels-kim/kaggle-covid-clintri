      This study will evaluate the feasibility of self-sampling with the iAMP® COVID-19 Detection&#xD;
      Kit (Atila BioSystems, Mountain View, CA), a new, low-cost SARS-CoV-2 test that does not&#xD;
      require RNA extraction. We will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the iAMP® assay on&#xD;
      self-sampled mid-turbinate, anterior nares, and saliva swabs against the gold standard, a&#xD;
      nucleic acid amplification testing assay on a clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab.&#xD;

      3.1.1 Study population: We will enroll patients within a larger clinical validation study of&#xD;
      the iAMP® test against the gold standard (the CDC-recommended test) until we have&#xD;
      prospectively collected a total of 100 positive cases. Current positivity in the region is&#xD;
      approximately 20%, therefore, approximately 500 samples will be needed. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are as follows: Patients older than 18 presenting for COVID-19 testing, able to tolerate&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs, and able to follow instructions for self-collection. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are as follows: unable or unwilling to provide informed consent and/or reliable contact&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2 Clinical visit: Symptomatic patients will be approached by a study provider wearing&#xD;
      PPE. The study will be explained and if the patient agrees, they will be consented. Patients&#xD;
      will be allowed to consent for just the two nasopharyngeal swabs or for all five swabs. After&#xD;
      consent, each patient will undergo testing with simultaneous placement of two nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs by a clinician for the large-scale clinical validation. One will be stored dry in a&#xD;
      tube and one will be placed in viral collection medium. Patients who consent to the&#xD;
      self-sampling study will be taken to a private area for collection of three different&#xD;
      samples. After receiving written instructions and watching a short instructional video, the&#xD;
      mid-turbinate sample will be collected by the patient under the supervision of a clinician.&#xD;
      The clinician will then leave and the patient will self-collect samples from the anterior&#xD;
      nares and saliva. All samples will be stored dry. When the patient returns the samples to the&#xD;
      research coordinator, they will be asked about any side effects or adverse events from the&#xD;
      mid-turbinate sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.3 Laboratory testing: A dry swab will be collected from two of the three iAMP®&#xD;
      self-sample sites - mid-turbinate and anterior nares - and placed into a vial with the&#xD;
      proprietary buffer (hereafter referred to as Sample Buffer A). For saliva, a sterile&#xD;
      collection cup will be used for the sample collection, and Sample Buffer A will be added&#xD;
      directly to the sterile collection cup. Each of the three samples with the added Sample&#xD;
      Buffer A will incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. A proprietary multiplex mixture&#xD;
      (master mix) will be prepared in a test tube and 10 microliters of the sample from the vial&#xD;
      (mid turbinate and nares) or cup (saliva) will be added to the test tube. The test tube will&#xD;
      then be placed into the RT-PCR machine and run to completion of the assay. The assay will be&#xD;
      resulted as either positive, negative or invalid (test to be repeated) and the result&#xD;
      compared to the anonymized result of the nasopharyngeal test run with the CDC recommended&#xD;
      NAAT assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions for patients on how to correctly collect the swabs from each site. [Cotton swabs&#xD;
      should be flocked and tapered].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mid-turbinate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wash and dry hands thoroughly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take a sterile cotton swab and hold it by the stem in your dominant hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open the empty iAMP collection vial and hold it in the other hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tilt your head back so chin is roughly parallel to ground (~70º)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insert the cotton swab to the mark on the stem (one inch, or ~2 cm) and rotate the&#xD;
           cotton swab completely (360º) 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the swab and without touching the cotton tip, repeat the process on the other&#xD;
           side with the same cotton swab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the swab from the nose, do not touch the cotton tip, and place the swab, cotton&#xD;
           tip first, into the vial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Break off the upper stem of the cotton swab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Replace the cap onto the vial, closing it securely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give the closed vial to the research personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior nares:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wash and dry hands thoroughly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take a sterile cotton swab and hold it by the stem in your dominant hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open the empty iAMP® collection vial and hold it in the other hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insert the cotton swab into one nostril just until the cotton tip is no longer visible&#xD;
           (~0.5 inches, or 1 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rotate it inside the nose completely (360º) 3 times and leave it in place for 10-15&#xD;
           seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the swab and without touching the cotton tip, repeat the process in the other&#xD;
           nostril, again inserting the cotton swab only until the cotton tip is no longer visible,&#xD;
           rotating it 3 times and leaving it in place for 10-15 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the swab, do not touch the cotton tip, and place the swab, cotton tip first, into&#xD;
           the vial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Break off the upper stem of the cotton swab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Replace the cap onto the vial, closing it securely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give the closed vial to the research personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum within 30 minutes of the collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take a sterile urine cup and spit repeatedly into it until there is 2-3 milliliters of&#xD;
           liquid (excluding bubbles). See image below for example of amount of saliva needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Keep inside of cup sterile by NOT placing anything (fingers, objects, etc) into the cup&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once adequate amount of saliva collected, place the cap onto the top of the cup and&#xD;
           close it securely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give closed cup to research personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4 Statistical justification Assuming 20% of specimens tested with the NAAT assay will be&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive, a study of 500 consecutive specimens will yield 100 COVID-19 cases&#xD;
      detected by the NAAT assay. This study will be able to estimate the 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI) for sensitivity and specificity indicated in the table below for true sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity ranging from 50% to 95%. The precision improves the farther the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity differ from 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: 95% confidence intervals for detecting sensitivity and specificity True Sensitivity&#xD;
      Sensitivity 95% CI True Specificity Specificity 95% CI 50% 39.8% - 60.2% 50% 45.0% - 55.0%&#xD;
      70% 60.0% - 78.8% 70% 65.2% - 74.5% 90% 82.4% - 95.1% 90% 86.6% - 92.8% 95% 88.7% - 98.4% 95%&#xD;
      92.3% - 96.9%&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.5 Risks/Safety The only risk of this study is the additional exposure of the laboratory&#xD;
      personnel performing the assay. All laboratorians involved are trained in handling infectious&#xD;
      agents such as COVID-19. All standard precautions will be used for the handling of the&#xD;
      specimens including aliquoting samples in a Biosafety hood and the use of Personal Protective&#xD;
      Equipment. Patient confidentiality will be assured by the anonymizing of patient samples as&#xD;
      previously approved by the MCW IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.6 Analysis. Sensitivity and specificity will be estimated for each iAMP® test as well as&#xD;
      corresponding 95% exact confidence intervals using the NAAT assay as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.7 Potential Clinical Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alternative anatomic sites will have lower sensitivity than nasopharyngeal swabs. It is&#xD;
           possible that the self-collected swabs will have significantly lower sensitivity than&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal swabs. This is unlikely to be the case because viral load with this novel&#xD;
           virus is very high&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients may refuse to have multiple swabs taken. Patients may refuse to give 5 samples.&#xD;
           Since the self-collected sites are unlikely to cause discomfort we expect that most&#xD;
           participants will agree to study participation. Even if many patients do not agree to&#xD;
           participate there are 700 patients per day presenting with symptoms which a large pool&#xD;
           of potential participants which will make it feasible to reach our goal. We may need to&#xD;
           continue enrollment until there are 100 self-collected COVID-19 + subjects if some&#xD;
           subjects refuse additional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the incidence of adverse events in a self-collected&#xD;
      mid-turbinate sample. According to the instructions for use (IFU), mid-turbinate swabs are&#xD;
      required to be collected under medical supervision,13 which the CDC reinforces. There have&#xD;
      been multiple studies that have demonstrated that mid-turbinate samples are effective for&#xD;
      detection of other respiratory illnesses.14-17 Since mid-turbinate collection may have higher&#xD;
      sensitivity than anterior nares or saliva testing, it is important to demonstrate that it can&#xD;
      be safely collected without clinical supervision. Although some patients may be able to&#xD;
      perform a mid-turbinate collection via a telehealth visit this would be a barrier to wide&#xD;
      scale-up. Thus, we will allow patients to self-collect a mid-turbinate sample with a&#xD;
      collection swab. The swab will have an indicator line signaling the mean length to reach the&#xD;
      mid-turbinate region in adults (approximately 1 inch, or 2 cms). The healthcare provider will&#xD;
      then evaluate the patient for any adverse events related to the patient self-collection, such&#xD;
      as pain and/or bleeding. If the incidence of adverse events is absent or very low (less than&#xD;
      5%) and the sensitivity of the mid-turbinate sample is superior to the anterior nares,&#xD;
      patients could be allowed to sample their own mid-turbinate region without medical&#xD;
      supervision. The proportion of participants experiencing each type of adverse event will be&#xD;
      estimated along with a corresponding 95% exact confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Summary The Covid-19 pandemic has created a global crisis that is affecting all sectors&#xD;
      of society. To decrease the catastrophic economic and healthcare impacts of this virus, the&#xD;
      availability of safe, inexpensive, and reliable testing will be necessary. This project aims&#xD;
      to study the self-collection of a low-cost, rapid test (iAMP®) in three anatomic areas - the&#xD;
      mid-turbinate, the nares and saliva - that, if validated, can help make widespread testing a&#xD;
      real possibility. The secondary aim is to show that all of these areas can be safely&#xD;
      self-collected without the need for clinician supervision. Decreasing barriers to Covid-19&#xD;
      testing and processing will help to mitigate this crisis and allow for a return to normal&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
