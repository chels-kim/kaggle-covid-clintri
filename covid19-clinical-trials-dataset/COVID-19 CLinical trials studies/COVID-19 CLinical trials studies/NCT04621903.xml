  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the most crucial global health concern of the century.&#xD;
      Given the complex interaction of physical and social factors on fast spreading infection,&#xD;
      there have been increasing calls for comprehensive efforts using a community-based&#xD;
      participatory research (CBPR) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBPR partnership composed of representatives from community-based organisations, health and&#xD;
      academia actively developed the present study. Specific aims were (1) to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Ayurvedic combination, Giloy (Tinospora Cordifolia) and Pippali (Piper longum)&#xD;
      in the management of mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 and (2) to determine the effect in&#xD;
      relieving COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the onset of severe infection.&#xD;
