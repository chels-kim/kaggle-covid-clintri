    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a global pandemics which affects many organs and systems&#xD;
      with a range of morbidities and high mortality rates. There are a number of studies revealed&#xD;
      that COVID-19 may affect the testes and male genital tract which may in turn disrupt the&#xD;
      gonadal functions.The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on semen&#xD;
      parameters and sex-related hormone levels.&#xD;

      In this current study, the investigators aimed to elucidate the alteration in semen&#xD;
      parameters of the infertile male patients who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, through the&#xD;
      comparison of the spermiogram results which were reported before and after the diagnosis of&#xD;
      COVID-19. The investigators also aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the sex-related&#xD;
      hormone levels as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and&#xD;
      testosterone (T). The current study is conducted in Ankara City Hospital, the highest&#xD;
      capacity tertiary health care center of the capital town of Turkey. The study included 21&#xD;
      patients who applied to Ankara City Hospital, Andrology Clinic for male infertility up to 05&#xD;
      October, 2020 and have had the semen analyses reported before and after the clinically&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 through reverse transcriptase PCR. Besides the semen&#xD;
      analyses, 8 of these 21 patients have also the had the reported levels of T, FSH and LH which&#xD;
      were also analyzed.&#xD;

        The data of overall 25 patients who applied to our clinic for infertility evaluation and&#xD;
        have had the semen analysis results reported before, and after the diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
        were reviewed. The 4 of the patients were found to have azoospermia. Due to the difficulty&#xD;
        to compare the change at semen parameters in case of azoospermia as before and after&#xD;
        results, these 4 patients were excluded. The study included 21 patients in final analyses.&#xD;
        The results were presented through the two dependent group analyses, based on the patients'&#xD;
        data collected before and after the diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnosis of COVID-19 had been established according to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
        the sample taken from nasopharynx with a cotton swap, which was examined through the&#xD;
        RT-PCR. None of the patients were at active phase of the COVID-19 at time of the semen&#xD;
        sampling.The serum samples for hormone analyses were obtained on the same days with the&#xD;
        semen samplings.&#xD;
