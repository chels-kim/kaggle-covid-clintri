    <textblock>
      This screening and multi-sub-study Phase 1b/2 trial will establish a method for genomic&#xD;
      screening followed by assigning and accruing simultaneously to a multi-study &quot;Master Protocol&#xD;
      (BAML-16-001-M1).&quot; The specific subtype of acute myeloid leukemia will determine which&#xD;
      sub-study, within this protocol, a participant will be assigned to evaluate investigational&#xD;
      therapies or combinations with the ultimate goal of advancing new targeted therapies for&#xD;
      approval. The study also includes a marker negative sub-study which will include all screened&#xD;
      patients not eligible for any of the biomarker-driven sub-studies.&#xD;

    <description>The study is an open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical study of TP-0903 given in addition to decitabine in patients â‰¥ 60 years with newly diagnosed, previously untreated AML with TP53 mutations and/or complex karyotype. The Phase 1b portion of this study will use a standard 3 + 3 design with dose escalation based upon dose limiting toxicities. The maximum tolerated dose will be defined as the highest dose where at most 1 patient in 6 experiences dose-limiting toxicity, and this is generally the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Once the RP2D is determined from Phase 1b, patients will be enrolled at this dose level to initiate the Phase 2 portion of the study.</description>

    <description>120 mg, oral, daily, with treatment continuing based on bone marrow results at 28 and 56 days. Patients with partial response at 28 days continue treatment for an additional 28 days. Patients with complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) at 28 or 56 days continue treatment for 5 years until time of intolerance or disease progression. Patients with less than partial response at 28 days or partial response at 28 days followed by less than CR or CRi at 56 days proceed to combination treatment with decitabine or non-study alternative.&#xD;
The combination dose is 80 mg, oral, daily, for 5 years until time of intolerance or disease progression (patients who do not achieve CR or CRi after 3 cycles will discontinue study treatment). The combination dose may be escalated to 120 mg daily or de-escalated to 80 mg daily given after decitabine rather than in combination with decitabine based on absence or occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity.</description>

    <description>20 mg/m2, IV, on days 1 through 10 of each 28-day cycle and continuing for up to 3 cycles. Treatment starts after 1-2 cycles of monotherapy with gilteritinib if patients do not attain complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) with monotherapy. Patients who do not achieve CR/CRi after 3 cycles of combination therapy will discontinue study treatment. If CR or CRi is obtained with combination therapy after 3 cycles, decitabine will be administered on days 1-5 of each subsequent 28-day cycle until progression, intolerance, or patient desire to discontinue therapy.</description>

Dose may be de-escalated to 10 mg or escalated to 30 mg based on occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity during phase 1 dose escalation. Starting with Cycle 2, patients may receive concomitant fluconazole, isavuconazole, or posaconazole and doses adjusted to 2, 5, or 8 mg daily. The Phase 1b expansion pharmacokinetics cohort will allow for posaconazole starting at Cycle 1 with AZD5153 dose adjusted from 10, 20, or 30 mg daily to 2, 5, or 8 mg daily. Phase 2 dose will be based on Phase 1 results.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Cohort Inclusion Criteria - Group B: Subjects must have relapsed or refractory AML&#xD;
             according to the WHO classification. For study purposes, refractory AML is defined as&#xD;
             failure to ever achieve CR or recurrence of AML within 6 months of achieving CR;&#xD;
             relapsed AML is defined as all others with disease after prior remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolated myeloid sarcoma (meaning, patients must have blood or marrow involvement with&#xD;
             AML to enter the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement by AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of leukostasis requiring urgent therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with active bleeding or signs of thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychological, familial, social, or geographic factors that otherwise&#xD;
             preclude them from giving informed consent, following the protocol, or potentially&#xD;
             hamper compliance with study treatment and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant medical condition, including psychiatric illness or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality, that would preclude the patient participating in the trial or would&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the results of the trial&#xD;
