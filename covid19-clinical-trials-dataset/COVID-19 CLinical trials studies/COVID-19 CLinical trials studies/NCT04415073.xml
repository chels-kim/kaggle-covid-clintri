  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day study to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of axatilimab plus standard of care, compared with placebo plus standard of care,&#xD;
      in patients with respiratory signs and symptoms secondary to novel coronavirus disease&#xD;
      (COVID-19).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Axatilimab (SNDX-6352) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high affinity against&#xD;
      CSF-1R under investigation for the prevention or treatment of respiratory signs and symptoms&#xD;
      secondary to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of axatilimab as an add-on to standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) therapy in hospitalized subjects with respiratory signs and symptoms secondary to&#xD;
      COVID-19 compared to SOC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment groups, active or&#xD;
      control. All subjects will receive axatilimab or matching placebo intravenously (IV) as an&#xD;
      add-on to SOC on Day 1, within 8 hours of randomization and on Day 15. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for at least 28 days (+3 days) after the first dose of study intervention (Day 29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the proportion of subjects alive and free of&#xD;
      respiratory failure at Day 29.&#xD;

    Given enrollment challenges, partly attributable to the constantly changing COVID-19 treatment&#xD;
