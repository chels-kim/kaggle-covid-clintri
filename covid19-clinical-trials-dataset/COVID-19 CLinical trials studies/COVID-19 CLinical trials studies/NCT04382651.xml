  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, participant and investigator blinded,&#xD;
      multi-center study to assess efficacy and safety of MAS825 for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infected patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and impaired respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of five parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening / Baseline / Treatment (Day -1 to 1): lasts up to a maximum of 24 hours and&#xD;
           comprises a screening / baseline assessment. This visit will be used to confirm that the&#xD;
           study inclusion and exclusion criteria are met and serves as baseline assessment prior&#xD;
           to randomization. Baseline blood tests will be performed in all patients; those who&#xD;
           screen fail because of study inclusion / exclusion criteria (e.g., serum CRP, liver&#xD;
           function tests), will not undergo randomization. Eligible patients will receive a single&#xD;
           i.v. infusion of MAS825 or placebo on Day -1 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period (Day 2-15): Study assessments to be conducted every 2 days for&#xD;
           hospitalized patients. If patients are discharged from the hospital prior to Day 15,&#xD;
           assessments on the day of discharge should be performed according to the schedule listed&#xD;
           under Day 15 and patient should return to the site for the Day 15 assessment (all other&#xD;
           visits between discharge and Day 15 can be omitted). If hospital visit is not possible&#xD;
           at Day 15, then home nursing services may be used to support this last visit where these&#xD;
           are available in accordance with local guidelines and should include all possible&#xD;
           assessments (e.g. oxygen saturation with portable monitors). In case home nursing is not&#xD;
           possible, patients will be contacted by phone on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up (Day 16-29): After completion of the treatment period, patients will be&#xD;
           observed until Day 29 or discharged from hospital, whichever is sooner. Study&#xD;
           assessments to be conducted every 2 days for domiciled patients. Where patients are&#xD;
           discharged from hospital prior to Day 29, a study visit conducted by telephone will&#xD;
           occur on Day 29 (all other visits between discharge and Day 29 can be omitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety follow-up visit assessment (Day 45): A follow-up visit will be conducted at Day&#xD;
           45 if the patient is hospitalized. If patients are discharged from hospital prior to Day&#xD;
           45, a study visit will be conducted by telephone on Day 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. End of Study/Safety follow-up visit assessment (Day 127): A follow-up visit for safety&#xD;
           will be conducted at Day 127 if the patient is hospitalized. If patients are discharged&#xD;
           from hospital prior to Day 127, a study visit will be conducted by telephone on Day 127.&#xD;

    <measure>APACHE II severity of disease score on Day 15 or on day of discharge (whichever is earlier)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The APACHE II (&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II&quot;) is a severity-of-disease classification system. An integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. Worst case imputation for death will be applied.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum C-reactive protein (CRP levels)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. For a standard CRP test, a normal reading is less than 10 milligram per liter (mg/L). It will be analyzed on a logscale fitting a repeated measures mixed model including treatment group, study day, the three stratification factors and log transformed baseline CRP as a covariate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ferritin levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Ferritin is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. For a standard Ferritin test, a normal reading is less than 300 micrograms per liter (μg/L). It will be analyzed on a logscale fitting a repeated measures mixed model including treatment group, study day, the three stratification factors and log transformed baseline Ferritin as a covariate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with at least one level improvement in clinical status</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical status is measured with the 9-point ordinal scale. The scoring is - Uninfected patients have a score 0 (no clinical or virological evidence of infection). - Ambulatory patients (not in hospital or in hospital and ready for discharge) can have a score 1 (no limitation of activities) or 2 (limitation of activities). -Hospitalized patients with mild disease can have score 3 (no oxygen therapy defined as SpO2 ≥ 94% on room air) or 4 (oxygen by mask or nasal prongs). - Hospitalized patients with severe disease can have score 5 (noninvasive ventilation or highflow oxygen), 6 (intubation and mechanical ventilation) or 7 (ventilation + additional organ support - pressors, RRT (renal replacement therapy), ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)). - Patients who die have a score 8.</description>
