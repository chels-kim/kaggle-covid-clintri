    <textblock>
      The aim of the clinical study is to determine the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity&#xD;
      parameters of the EpiVacCorona vaccine in volunteers aged 18-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research tasks are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice intramuscularly;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the reactogenicity of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice&#xD;
           intramuscularly;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the development of adverse reactions to vaccine administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study the humoral and cellular immune responses following two doses of the EpiVacCorona&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The first phase of the clinical trial is an open trial. The study will enroll 14 men and&#xD;
      women aged 18 to 30 years, inclusive, who meet the inclusion criteria and have no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, whose data will be used for subsequent analysis of safety and immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the clinical trial is a simple, blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-group study. The study will enroll 86 men and women aged 18 to 60 years, inclusive,&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria and have no exclusion criteria whose, the data will be used&#xD;
      for subsequent analysis of safety and immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If volunteers drop out of the study, they will not be replaced.&#xD;

    <description>EpiVacCorona vaccine is intended to prevent COVID-19. The vaccine relies on chemically synthesized peptide antigens of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, conjugated to a carrier protein and adsorbed on an aluminum-containing adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide). The EpiVacCorona vaccine contributes to the development of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus following two intramuscular administrations spaced 21-28 days apart.</description>
