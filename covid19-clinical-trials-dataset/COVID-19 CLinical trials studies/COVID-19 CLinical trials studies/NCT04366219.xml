  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unexpected onset of SARS-COV2 infection modified our practices, especially in routine&#xD;
      medicine. In order to reverse the epidemic curve of severe cases and slow the spread of the&#xD;
      infection, confinement was generalized in France from March 13, 2020.These restrictive&#xD;
      measures were imposed on anyone with symptoms compatible with the infection, with the&#xD;
      exception of dyspnea and other criteria of severity. March 12, 2020 is the pivotal date when&#xD;
      the management of COVID came to interfere with medical and healthcare organizations. From&#xD;
      this date, it is likely that some imaging or endoscopic exams have been de-scheduled for&#xD;
      symptoms that are sometimes wrongly judged to be non-urgent and have seen their numbers drop&#xD;
      dramatically.Otherwise, concerning lung cancer, preventive measures have been extremely&#xD;
      strengthened. For instance, it is recommended to delay surgeries for localized tumors, to&#xD;
      relieve or remove some chemotherapy or to delete radiotherapy sessions deemed non-essential.&#xD;
      However, symptoms that may initially be attributed to viral infection, such as cough, fever,&#xD;
      fatigue, or chest pain may be clinical indicators of early-stage Lung cancer. In addition,&#xD;
      lung cancer is likely to make the patient more susceptible to pneumopathy, due to a weakened&#xD;
      of immune response to viruses and bacteria. Consequently, as necessary as the restriction&#xD;
      measures are, a risk of slowing down in the management of the Lung cancer pathology exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBP-COVID Study intends to assess consequences of restrictive measures linked to the&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 epidemic, by comparing clinical characteristics at diagnosis, treatment times and&#xD;
      treatments, regarding to 2 distinct time periods identical to the calendar, but one in 2019,&#xD;
      the other in 2020.&#xD;
