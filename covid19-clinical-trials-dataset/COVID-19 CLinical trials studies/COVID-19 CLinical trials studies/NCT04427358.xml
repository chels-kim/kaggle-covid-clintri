      Evaluation of the rate of positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test at 1 month of COVID infection among&#xD;
      elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear how long an individual with COVID-19 will remain &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;contagious&quot;. It&#xD;
      appears that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted before symptoms appear and throughout the course&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They investigators did not find any study on a COVID + geriatric population reassessing&#xD;
      carriage at 1 month even though age seems to be a risk factor for prolonged excretion as&#xD;
      suggested in the study following study: Xu K, Chen Y, Yuan J, Yi P, Ding C, Wu W, et al.&#xD;
      Factors associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Clinical&#xD;

    <measure>2. Assess quantitative evaluation of a nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 month after COVID infection</time_frame>
    <description>The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess viral shedding in COVID-19 infected elderly patients who survived infection in order to provide an overview of the evolution of nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results with the Cycle threshold value of the RT-PCR test.. The investigatrors analyze nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at diagnosis. After one month since the date of onset symptoms they reassessed survival patients with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and repeat the RT-PCR at least every week until final negative conversion occurs.</description>
