      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Clinical trial is to explore the therapeutic benefits of Ivermectin and&#xD;
      Doxycycline in different combinations. The investigators are studying known medications at&#xD;
      already FDA approved dosages for therapeutic benefit. The investigators are not seeking new&#xD;
      indications for these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that treating high-risk populations positive for COVID-19&#xD;
      illness with Ivermectin, Doxycycline, or Ivermectin only in the outpatient setting will&#xD;
      decrease hospitalizations related to COVID-19 illness in comparison with Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Minimum of 50 high risk COVID 19 positive patients who volunteer and provide&#xD;
      consent to participate in this study to be placed in three different groups (A,B,C). Subjects&#xD;
      are to be randomized 1:1:1 and enrolled in sequential order to Group A, then B, then C as&#xD;
      they enroll. This distribution pattern will be followed for the entirety of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Ivermectin plus Doxycycline Group B: Ivermectin plus Placebo Group C: Placebo plus&#xD;
      Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Dosing schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg on day 1 and day 2-plus doxycycline 100 mg tablets twice a day&#xD;
      for seven days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg on day 1 and day 2-plus placebo tablet twice a day for seven&#xD;
      days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Placebo (number of tablets according to weight) plus placebo twice a day for seven&#xD;
      days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Weight (kg) Table for tablets of Ivermectin&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-24 kg 1 tablet 25-35 kg 2 tablets 36-50 kg 3 tablets 51-65 kg 4 tablets 66-79 kg 5 tablets&#xD;
      80-109 kg 6 tablets &gt;110 kg 7 tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
      The designated pharmacy will provide pre-packed treatment to patients based on the order of&#xD;
      enrollment to the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) Upon diagnosis of COVID-19 with NAAT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Test for SARS-COV 2, patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated by their primary care physician who will consider the health risk of&#xD;
      patients and provide all alternatives. Primary care physicians will recommend these patients&#xD;
      to a treatment hotline number. Patients can also self refer to the treatment hot line.&#xD;
      Patients will call this provided hotline number, and if they wish to be a part of the above&#xD;
      said clinical trial, it will connect them to the Principal Investigator's (Dr Werther&#xD;
      Marciales) Team. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients will be assigned to one&#xD;
      of three different study groups outlined above. Each participant in all randomized groups&#xD;
      will receive treatment as specified above as soon as the patient signs consent and agrees to&#xD;
      participate in said clinical trial. Patient's subjective data including but not limited to&#xD;
      age, gender, height, weight, detailed medical history, or any objective data will be&#xD;
      collected and kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) Patients will undergo blood work (CBC, CMP, Ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, CK, PT/INR, PTT and&#xD;
      Fibrinogen) at baseline. Blood work will be repeated on days 7 and 14. These medications used&#xD;
      in the clinical study will have a good safety profile, which has been tested over a period of&#xD;
      time. All patients enrolled in the trial will be thoroughly evaluated prior to detailed&#xD;
      history, especially regarding home medications, and severe co-morbid conditions as listed in&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (C) During the clinical trial, the study doctor, or the subject's primary care provider will&#xD;
      be involved in treatment of subjects if and when there are any adverse reactions or if&#xD;
      subjects need additional care. If a patient's COVD-19 relayed symptoms worsen then, he/she&#xD;
      would be admitted to the hospital for further care, including mechanical ventilation if&#xD;
      required. These patients clinical data will be followed for the remainder of he&#xD;
      hospitalization. A patient admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 related illness will be&#xD;
      considered to reach outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for admission of confirmed COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient must have COVID-19 illness and at least one of the following two conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At least 2 of the CURB-65 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SpO2 &lt;93% on room air or a 4% decrease from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      CURB 65 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confusion of new onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood Urea Nitrogen greater then 7 mmol/L (19 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood Pressure less then 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Age 65 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
      (D) Patients will be advised to quarantine themselves and record their temperature twice&#xD;
      daily and maintain a home log. Patients will obtain a pulse oximeter to monitor their oxygen&#xD;
      levels at least twice a day. Patients will also be submitted to symptoms questionnaire or&#xD;
      ARDS questionnaire either in person or over telephone or through televist twice a week for&#xD;
      total of five weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (E) All treatment groups will also be monitored for any adverse events related to medication&#xD;
      therapy during treatment and for 4 weeks thereafter on a twice a week basis using ADR&#xD;
      Monitoring form. All moderate and severe adverse drug reactions will be notified to the&#xD;
      principal investigator for immediate actions, which might include discontinuation of therapy&#xD;
      after establishing a causal relationship. All adverse drug reactions will be recorded and&#xD;
      reported to the FDA using Form 3500, which will be faxed to 1 800 FDA 0178. Due to the severe&#xD;
      nature of transmissibility of COVID-19 and the importance of minimizing human interaction and&#xD;
      preservation of Personal Protective Equipment, patients will be followed either in person,&#xD;
      telephonically or via Televisit. Exclusion Criteria will mitigate the risk of involving&#xD;
      patients susceptible to side effects of study treatment medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size is estimated at 150 participants (Minimum 50 patients in each group).&#xD;
      The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will compare group differences at baseline,&#xD;
      midpoint, and endpoint. Data analysis will be carried out using statistical package for the&#xD;
      social sciences software (SPSS). Interim data analysis will be performed at three different&#xD;
      levels of the number of participants starting at sample size 20, 30 and 50. If no significant&#xD;
      findings are obtained from the data at N=50, then it will add more participants to the study&#xD;
      to achieve statistical significance. Sponsor and Principal Investigator will defer data&#xD;
      analysis to a statistician. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is going to be established in&#xD;
      order to review accumulating trial data by treatment group in order to monitor patient safety&#xD;
      and efficacy, ensure validity and integrity of the trial and make benefit-risk assessment.&#xD;
      This is going to be conducted by a third party external DMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained via phone, telecommunications, or in person and a copy of&#xD;
      the consent will be sent to the subjects via postal mail, email or both. All information will&#xD;
      be kept confidential. For research records, name, social security number, address, or phone&#xD;
      number will not identify patients. In the event of any publication or presentation resulting&#xD;
      from the research, no personally identifiable information will be shared. The investigators&#xD;
      will keep the patients participation in the research study confidential to the extent&#xD;
      permitted by law. Patient identifiers might be removed from data and, after such removal, the&#xD;
      data could be used for future research or distributed to another investigator for future&#xD;
      studies without additional informed consent from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no funding available at this time, and the study will be self sponsored by MAX&#xD;
      HEALTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no compensation offered as part of participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be charged for any services that are performed as part of their clinical care.&#xD;
      Patients will not be compensated for travel or time. Patients are required to get their&#xD;
      medication (s) used in the clinical trial from a dedicated pharmacy. Study drugs will be&#xD;
      provided to the patients at no cost to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal from this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may elect to withdraw from the study at any point. During the clinical trial, if&#xD;
      a patients COVID-19 related symptoms worsen, then they would admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
      further care, including mechanical ventilation if required, and the clinical data from this&#xD;
      subset of patients will not be used for statistical consideration of this study. Still, these&#xD;
      patients clinical data will be followed for the remainder of the hospitalization.&#xD;
