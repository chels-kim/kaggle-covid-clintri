    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the transmission of&#xD;
      respiratory diseases and the correct wearing of masks, as well as the factors affecting the&#xD;
      correct wearing of masks. The research is beneficial to the prevention of respiratory&#xD;
      diseases and moves the barrier of prevention and control forward. It is of great significance&#xD;
      to COVID-19 's practical prevention and control.&#xD;

      1. Overall design：This study uses the methods of cross-sectional survey and chance&#xD;
           sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sign the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigation on the basic situation of personnel: The gender, age and education level&#xD;
           of the subjects were analyzed as the factors influencing whether the mask was worn&#xD;
           correctly or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigation on the types of wearing masks： 1) The types of masks worn by the subjects&#xD;
           were recorded as the basis of stratified statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Mask suitability testing：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual inspection whether the mask is close to the face with obvious gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breathing test whether it can blow the cotton wool under the eyes when the subject&#xD;
           taking a deep breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spray test The FT-30 qualitative fitness test system of 3M company was used to test the&#xD;
           suitability and correctness of wearing mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the spray test, all subjects underwent a sensitivity test to prove their ability to smell&#xD;
      the bitterness of the reagent, and then were randomly divided into a hood group and a direct&#xD;
      spray group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to objectively reflect the overall situation of the subjects, it is necessary to&#xD;
      cover many ages and educational levels of men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject participated in the study for about 5-6 minutes, and the total duration of this&#xD;
      study was about 3 months.&#xD;
