  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) treatment will be provided to patients as an adjunct to&#xD;
      standard therapy for a cohort of 40 COVID19-positive patients with respiratory distress at&#xD;
      NYU Winthrop Hospital. All patients prior to the clinical application of HBOT will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the primary care team and hyperbaric physician. After the intervention portion&#xD;
      of this study, a chart review will be performed to compare the outcomes of intervention&#xD;
      patients versus patients who received standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective pilot cohort study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as an emergency investigational device for treating patients&#xD;
      with a novel coronavirus, disease, COVID-19. Patients that meet inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      consented by the hyperbaric physician. They will then be transported from the ED or other&#xD;
      unit to the hyperbaric unit maintaining airborne precautions based on the most current&#xD;
      hospital protocol. All study personnel will have proper PPE at all times. The patient will&#xD;
      then be placed into the monoplace chamber and when the chamber door is closed the patient&#xD;
      will remove any respiratory filter/mask that was placed. The patient will receive 90 minutes&#xD;
      of hyperbaric oxygen at 2.0 ATA with or without airbreaks per the hyperbaric physician. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the treatment the patient will then return to the medical unit and continue all&#xD;
      standard of care. Additional treatments (up to 5) can be given if warranted and agreed upon&#xD;
      by the patient and all members of the team caring for the patient. After the intervention&#xD;
      portion of this study, a chart review will be performed to compare the outcomes of&#xD;
      intervention patients versus patients who received standard of care.&#xD;
