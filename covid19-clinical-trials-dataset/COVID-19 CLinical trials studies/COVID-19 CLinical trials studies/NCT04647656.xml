    <textblock>
      Post-COVID-19 syndrome is an assembly of symptoms, following an infection with COVID-19. The&#xD;
      syndrome is characterized by cognitive impairment, fatigue, sleep disorders, smell and taste&#xD;
      disorders, pain and more. This long-term sequela can last for months after recovering from&#xD;
      the virus, and no treatment is known to date. The aim of this study is to compare the effect&#xD;
      of HBOT vs. Sham on post COVID-19 syndrome&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-COVID-19 syndrome is an assembly of signs and symptoms first described on patients&#xD;
      recovering from severe COVID-19 infection. The syndrome is characterized by cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, fatigue, and other neurologic symptoms. With time, and the growing understanding&#xD;
      on this unique virus, there is cumulative case serries reports on patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate disease, suffering from long standing post-COVID-19 syndrome. Taking in&#xD;
      consideration, this pandemic is worldwide and still spreading, there's an urgent need for&#xD;
      effective treatment for those patients who are suffering from the long standing, life&#xD;
      debilitating, post-COVID-19 syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurologic signs and symptoms are common during hospitalization with COVID-19, with 42% of&#xD;
      patients at onset of the disease and 82% during the course of the disease. Patients report&#xD;
      mainly on myalgias, headaches, encephalopathy, dizziness, dysgeusia, and anosmia. After&#xD;
      recovering from COVID-19, many patients continue to suffer from symptoms. Only 13% of the&#xD;
      patients were completely free of symptoms after full resolution of the virus. The main&#xD;
      symptom, reported by more than half the patients included cognitive impairment, fatigue and&#xD;
      sleep disorders. A recent study analyzed data from 84,285 Individuals who recovered from&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed COVID-19 showed reduced cognitive performance. This deficit scales&#xD;
      with symptom severity and is evident amongst those without hospital treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main biological sequelae of COVID-19 might play a role in the pathogenesis of this&#xD;
      syndrome. The first is hypercoagulability state accompanies acute infection. This is&#xD;
      characterized by increased risk of small and large vessel occlusion and is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality [9]. Neurologic complications might be a result of micro-infarcts in the&#xD;
      central of peripheral nervous system; The second is an uncontrolled inflammatory response,&#xD;
      called cytokines storm. This cytokine release is characterized by an increase in IL-1, IL-6,&#xD;
      TNF-Î± and a change in macrophages population. Thus, COVID-19 can cause neuroinflammation,&#xD;
      that might be prolonged and lead to signs of post-COVID-19 syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Micro-infarcts and neuroinflammation are important causes of local hypoxia, and&#xD;
      specifically neurological hypoxia. One of the options to reverse hypoxia, reduce&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and induce neuroplasticity is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures&#xD;
      exceeding 1 atmosphere absolute, thus enhancing the amount of oxygen dissolved in the body&#xD;
      tissues. During HBOT, the arterial O2 tension typically exceeds 2000 mmHg, and levels of&#xD;
      200-400 mmHg occur in tissues Even though many of the beneficial effects of HBOT can be&#xD;
      explained by improvement of tissue oxygenation, it is now understood that the combined action&#xD;
      of hyperoxia and hyperbaric pressure, triggers both oxygen and pressure sensitive genes,&#xD;
      resulting in inducing regenerative processes including stem cells proliferation and&#xD;
      mobilization with anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HBOT protocol will be administrated in a multi-place chamber. The protocol includes 40&#xD;
      daily sessions, 5 sessions per week for two months. Treatment group will subjected to 100%&#xD;
      oxygen by mask at 2 ATA for 90 minutes with 5 minute air breaks every 20 minutes. Sham group&#xD;
      will be subjected to 21% oxygen by mast for 90 minutes, at 1.2 ATA during the first five&#xD;
      minutes of the session with the noise of circulating air, and then decrease slowly during the&#xD;
      next five minutes to 1.03 ATA.&#xD;
