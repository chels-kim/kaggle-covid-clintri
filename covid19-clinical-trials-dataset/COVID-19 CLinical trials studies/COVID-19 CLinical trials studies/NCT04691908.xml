    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to prove the superiority of the QazCovid-in®-vaccine&#xD;
      inactivated against COVID-19 in comparison with placebo in terms of seroconversion (the&#xD;
      proportion of persons with a fourfold or higher increase in antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2) on&#xD;
      the 21st, 42nd day, 90th and 180th days after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity of the QazCovid-in® vaccine inactivated against COVID-19&#xD;
      versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate vaccine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the safety of vaccine versus placebo.&#xD;
