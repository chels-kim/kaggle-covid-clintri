  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global healthcare systems has prompted search for&#xD;
      novel tools to stem the tide. New digital health tools can provide possible health solutions&#xD;
      in this time of unprecedented medical crisis to mitigate the impact of this pandemic. This&#xD;
      proof of concept study will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a&#xD;
      mobile application for contactless measurement of vital signs (MAC-VITAL) such as blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate variability (HRV),&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and body mass index (BMI) from surgical patients&#xD;
      peri-operatively. Contactless measurement of vital signs will bridge the current gap between&#xD;
      virtual care and in-person medical assessments. This study aims to determine whether a mobile&#xD;
      app can effectively measure vital signs without any person to person contact and how this&#xD;
      technology can be implemented in a peri-operative setting during COVID-19.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective proof of concept study to be conducted at Toronto Western&#xD;
      Hospital, and Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario. This&#xD;
      proof of concept study will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a&#xD;
      contactless mobile application to obtain vital signs, and BMI from patients in the&#xD;
      peri-operative setting. Informed consent to participate in the study will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs measurement will be obtained by the research staff using hospital standard&#xD;
      medical devices and the Anura Research App will also be used to measure vital signs.&#xD;
      Measurement will take place before surgery and post surgery (1 ±2hrs and 2 ±4hrs after&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;
