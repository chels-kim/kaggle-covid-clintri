      A randomized, open-label, 2 arm, pilot trial of Lambda 180 mcg administered subcutaneously&#xD;
      once weekly, for up to two weeks (2 injections at most), in addition to standard supportive&#xD;
      care, compared to standard supportive care alone, in a population of COVID-19 infected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients will be randomized according to 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 trial arms: Lambda 180 mcg&#xD;
      S.C + standard care (intervention arm) or standard care only (control arm).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative pathogen of a&#xD;
      rapidly spreading infection associated with pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      (COVID-19), for which there is currently no approved therapy. Interferon Lambda (IFN Lambda)&#xD;
      is a type III interferon with broad anti-viral activity and receptor distribution limited to&#xD;
      the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelium. Studies in animal models suggest that IFN&#xD;
      Lambda may ameliorate infection with respiratory viruses such as influenza coronaviruses. The&#xD;
      WHO has recently included pegylated interferon lambda in its landscape analysis of potential&#xD;
      therapeutics for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, open-label, 2 arms, pilot trial, up to 40 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19 and mild to moderate respiratory infection, will be randomized to one of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms in 1:1 ratio: 1. Lambda 180 mcg administered S.C once weekly, for up to two weeks (2&#xD;
      injections at most) + standard care, Or 2. Standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of Lambda will be assessed by PCR analysis for COVID-19 (Fluxergy, Irvine CA), from&#xD;
      respiratory secretions obtained by nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected&#xD;
      consecutively at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 following initial diagnosis or until patients&#xD;
      are discharged following achievement of two consecutive PCR negative tests for COVID-19.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability of Lambda will be assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital&#xD;
      signs assessment and clinical laboratory tests (CBC, and extended chemistry panel).&#xD;
