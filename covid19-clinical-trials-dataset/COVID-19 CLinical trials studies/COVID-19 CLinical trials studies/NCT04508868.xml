  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of a brief psychological&#xD;
      intervention for improving depressed mood in older individuals (65 years and older) in&#xD;
      isolation during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The treatment is delivered by telephone&#xD;
      and consists of four weekly individual sessions. Two therapeutic methods are used in&#xD;
      combination during this intervention: Behavioral activation (BA) and Mental Imagery (MI). BA&#xD;
      involves identifying and scheduling enjoyable and meaningful activities to improve mood and&#xD;
      reduce social isolation. To enhance BA efficacy and adherence, MI is paired with BA as MI is&#xD;
      known to activate emotion and motivation. The MI intervention in this study involves having&#xD;
      participants imagine, in vivid sensory detail, engaging in some of the activities that are&#xD;
      scheduled during BA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 154 individuals will participate in the study. Half of the participants will be&#xD;
      randomised to start the intervention immediately, while the other half of the participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to a control group receiving the intervention after 4 weeks. This&#xD;
      procedure makes it possible to evaluate the effects of the treatment while not disadvantaging&#xD;
      participants randomized to the control group. Participants will be asked to fill in&#xD;
      questionnaires before, during (at the end of each intervention week), and after treatment (or&#xD;
      waiting period for the control group). Questionnaires will also be sent 1-, 3- and 6 months&#xD;
      after treatment to follow up on the results. A smaller group of participants (10-15) will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a more detailed interview about how they experienced the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. The mortality rates are highest in&#xD;
      the older age groups, particularly in those 70 years and older. In Sweden, the government&#xD;
      urges people 70 years and older to limit close contact with other people and to stay at home&#xD;
      as much as possible, a strategy called social distancing. From previous epidemics, such as&#xD;
      the SARS-epidemic, we know that quarantine and isolation leads to psychological symptoms such&#xD;
      as stress, irritability, depressed mood and sleep problems. About 30% of those subjected to&#xD;
      isolation and quarantine become depressed, and in a study from Hong Kong during SARS there&#xD;
      was a nearly 32% increase of suicide rates among individuals 65 years and older. In Sweden,&#xD;
      depression among the elderly was a major public health concern before the covid-19-pandemic -&#xD;
      Major depression occurred in 5-15 % of the older population in Sweden, and one third of the&#xD;
      women and a fifth of the men 65 years and older reported subclinical depressive symptoms.&#xD;
      Several mental health experts raise concerns that there will be an increase of psychiatric&#xD;
      illness during and after covid-19, particularly among the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression in older individuals can be treated with antidepressant medication, psychological&#xD;
      interventions and physical activity. However, the majority of the older individuals state&#xD;
      that they would prefer psychological treatments to medication, which poses a challenge during&#xD;
      COVID-19 as such treatments are often delivered face-to-face. Psychological treatments&#xD;
      delivered via the Internet are as efficacious as face-to-face, but only 3-4% of the&#xD;
      individuals 65 years and above in Sweden use digital applications that replace physical&#xD;
      healthcare visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological treatments have been shown to work when delivered via telephone, and since&#xD;
      practically every household in Sweden has access to a telephone, the investigators believe&#xD;
      this could be a feasible option. Preferably, the treatment should be brief yet effective, and&#xD;
      easily accessible for healthcare professionals. One such treatment is brief behavioral&#xD;
      activation (BA), which is aimed at increasing enjoyable and meaningful activities to improve&#xD;
      mood. BA has been shown to be feasible in as few as four sessions. Depression is often&#xD;
      accompanied by low motivation and lack of energy, which can pose a problem when trying to&#xD;
      increase activities. One way of increasing motivation in BA and the likelihood of performing&#xD;
      the planned activities is to add mental imagery (MI), where some of these activities are&#xD;
      imagined in detail during the calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are to the investigators knowledge no studies of telephone-delivered brief BA&#xD;
      for older individuals, no studies of the combination of BA and MI for depression in the&#xD;
      elderly, and no studies of either of these during pandemics with isolation or quarantine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility, effect and experience of&#xD;
      telephone-delivered Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery for the treatment of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in individuals 65 years and older during the covid-19-pandemic.&#xD;
