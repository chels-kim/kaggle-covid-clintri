  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel human coronavirus that is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly called HCoV-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and is now&#xD;
      causing a pandemic. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact&#xD;
      of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with&#xD;
      contaminated objects and surfaces. As a new chapter in human life opens up, the world seems&#xD;
      to be divided into two parts pre- and post-COVID-19 era. Body mass index (BMI) is widely used&#xD;
      to define obesity and overweight in adults. A BMI between 25 and 30 indicates overweight and&#xD;
      above 30 indicates obesity. It is important to note that the levels of the inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines found in obese people are significantly higher than those in lean people, but they&#xD;
      are still lower than those in individuals with infection or trauma. Obesity-mediated&#xD;
      alterations in the airways and immune system are extremely important at the present moment&#xD;
      considering SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is designed to determine the effect of&#xD;
      overweight and obesity with outcomes of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      in critical care setting. Also, to see outcomes of assisted ventilation in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may help in establishing strong association of obesity with COVID-19 in our part of the&#xD;
      world. This may open new treatment strategies for COVID-19 by treating obesity as an&#xD;
      essential risk factor.&#xD;

      This Prospective Cohort Study study will be conducted in COVID-19 Intensive care unit,&#xD;
      Services hospital Lahore. it will be completed in 3 months after approval of proposal taking&#xD;
      100 patients using Non Probability Purposive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethical approval, research will be started and patients will be recruited from ICU&#xD;
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized to two groups&#xD;
      Group A with normal BMI and Group B having over weight and obese patients. They will be given&#xD;
      standard treatment as practiced and outcome will be measured in terms of recovery from&#xD;
      disease or death. Duration of stay in hospital, progression of disease, O2 requirement,&#xD;
      improvement in biochemical profile and radiology or occurrence of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be put in SPSS version 25 and analysis will be done.&#xD;
