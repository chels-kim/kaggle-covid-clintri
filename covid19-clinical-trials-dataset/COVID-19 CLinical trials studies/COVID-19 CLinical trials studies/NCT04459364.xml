  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The virus infection Covid-19 fills our hospitals and intensive care departments in a very&#xD;
      unique way and there is a lack of essential insight into the pathophysiology of the disease.&#xD;
      As a result, very specific treatment options are missing. The US Medicines Agency (FDA) has&#xD;
      in the last days given a general license for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).&#xD;
      Inhaled NO in Sweden (and Europe) is approved for the indication of pulmonary hypertension in&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no one has yet described the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension, with or without&#xD;
      right ventricular loading, in the Covid-19 patients who become so seriously ill that they&#xD;
      need to be treated at an IVA ward. Knowledge of this is, of course, a prerequisite for&#xD;
      determining the need for pulmonary artery catheterization (PA catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter)&#xD;
      and also to better understand whether iNO treatment or other forms of lung selective&#xD;
      vasodilation therapy may be of benefit to this patient group.&#xD;

        This is a non-interventional retrospective study to be performed in an intensive care unit&#xD;
        in Sweden. The study will include 80 Covid-19 patients who had been examined with&#xD;
        echocardiography. Data will be collected through chart review.&#xD;
