  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the actual situation of communication during the Coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) pandemic in the South Asia and Middle East region. The purpose is to assess the&#xD;
      effect of the limited visitor policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the pattern of&#xD;
      interaction of critically ill patients to their kin/ guardian and doctor-family members&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the changes in communication pattern with limited contact during the COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the methods of informed consent in Intensive care units (ICUs) during the same&#xD;
           period&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An observational, cross-sectional, web-based questionnaire survey, with multi-centre&#xD;
      involvement across hospitals in the South Asia and middle-east region. The questionnaire&#xD;
      consists of two sections. Section one obtains information from participants regarding&#xD;
      communication and visiting practices in ICU during pre-COVID-19 era, and the Section two&#xD;
      obtains information regarding the policy changes if any during the COVID-19 pandemic in&#xD;
      regards to safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain the largest representation of South Asia and Middle East ICUs, a network&#xD;
      of research doctors as facilitators from each country is created. The role of the&#xD;
      facilitators is to contact and recruit adult ICUs within their country. Each facilitator&#xD;
      contacts the hospitals (public and private), creating a network of collaborating&#xD;
      doctors/nurses (participants) from those hospitals who expressed their willingness to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: a web based Google Forms with online access will be used Only one entry per&#xD;
      ICU will be collected during the study. Statistic analysis: a descriptive analysis is planned&#xD;
      for the general characteristics of the participating units and the study population.&#xD;
