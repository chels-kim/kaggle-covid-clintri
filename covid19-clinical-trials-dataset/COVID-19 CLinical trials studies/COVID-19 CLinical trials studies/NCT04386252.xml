  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase I-II trial of a vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells&#xD;
      previously loaded ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with or without GM-CSF, to prevent&#xD;
      COVID-19 in adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects eligible for treatment will be those who at baseline, are not actively infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, have no evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on serologic testing,&#xD;
      and give informed consent for a vaccination with AV-COVID-19. The patient population will&#xD;
      include the elderly and others at higher risk for poor outcomes after COVID-19 infection. For&#xD;
      this reason, individuals will not be excluded solely on the basis of age, body mass index,&#xD;
      history of hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolling for screening, subjects will undergo a nasal swab test to exclude active&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection and a rapid test for anti-coronavirus antibodies to exclude pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 50 mL of blood will be collected, from which peripheral blood&#xD;
      monocytes will be isolated and differentiated into DC before incubation with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      S-protein, during which time the protein is digested into 9 to 25 amino acid peptide&#xD;
      sequences presented on the dendrites of DC in conjunction with histocompatibility class I and&#xD;
      class II molecules. Safety and quality testing will be performed on a small quantity of the&#xD;
      batch, and the remaining AV-COVID-19 will be cryopreserved for shipping to the treatment&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the Study Drug is ready, if eligible, the subject will be seen at Study Week-0 for&#xD;
      treatment. Prior to injection of the Study Drug, a nasal swab test will be collected to&#xD;
      confirm that they are still negative for COVID-19, and blood will be drawn to determine&#xD;
      baseline levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. At the treatment site, the product will be&#xD;
      thawed and admixed with saline or (saline with GM-CSF), and within 5 hours of thawing, will&#xD;
      be injected SC via a 25-gauge needle&#xD;
