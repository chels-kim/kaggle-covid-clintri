      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 patients with a PCR-based diagnosis of Covid-19 will be be included to give 500&#xD;
      microliters of saliva and a 3 ml sample of blood for proteomic analysis; a drop of blood will&#xD;
      also be put in a device connected to a silica matrix to perform spectrometric analyses. 25&#xD;
      patients with a non-Covid-19 respiratory infection will be included for the same samples. The&#xD;
      proteomic analyses will be performed from classicaly draught blood, blood drop on silica, and&#xD;
      saliva, to search for discriminating profiles between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 patients with a suspected Covid-19 will be included at the same time than the Covid-19PCR&#xD;
      is performed ; they will have a sample of saliva and of a drop of blood for proteomic&#xD;
      analysis, whose results will be matched with PCR results.&#xD;
