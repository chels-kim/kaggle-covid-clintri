             chest radiograph, chest computed tomography or chest auscultation (rales, crackles)&#xD;
             and with severe disease defined as follows: The participant requires supplemental&#xD;
             oxygen administered by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen&#xD;
             delivery device (ie, increase in oxygen requirement following SARS-CoV-2 infection).&#xD;

          -  Any prior or concurrent use or plans to receive during the study period of&#xD;
             immunomodulatory therapies (other than interventional drug) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of chronic systemic corticosteroids for a non-COVID-19-related condition in a dose&#xD;
             higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria related to tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial&#xD;
             (NTM) infections.&#xD;
