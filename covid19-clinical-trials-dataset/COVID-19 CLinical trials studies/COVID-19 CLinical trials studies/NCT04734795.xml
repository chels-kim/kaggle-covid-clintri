  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the prevalence of dysfunctional breathing in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with asthma in a hospital outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to take the Nijmegen Questionnaire and the Asthma Control&#xD;
      Questionnaire. The prevalence of dysfunctional breathing defined as NQ score &gt;= 23 is&#xD;
      calculated, and demographics are compared between children with and without dysfunctional&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the prevalence of dysfunctional breathing in&#xD;
      children and adolecents with asthma in a hospital outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to take the Nijmegen Questionnaire and the Asthma Control&#xD;
      Questionnaire, during appointments at the outpatient clinic. For this study purpose, each&#xD;
      participant only takes the questionnairres once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data regarding age, sex, asthma medication, lung function, allergic sensitization,&#xD;
      method of asthma diagnose, Height, weight and Body mass index is registered from the&#xD;
      electronical patient journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of dysfunctional breathing in the cohort is calculated as the fraction of&#xD;
      children with a NQ score &gt;= 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of children and adolescents with dysfunctional breathing is characterized and&#xD;
      compared to the group without dysfunctional breathing, regarding the descriptives mentioned&#xD;
      above.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of children with dysfunctional breathing defined as Nijmegen Questionnaire ( NQ) Score &gt;= 23</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Nijmegen Questionnaire is a 16 point questionnairre addressing dysfunctional breathing. Each question is scored from 0 (best) to 4 (worst). NQ score is summarized between 0-64 points. NQ score &gt;= 23 predicts dysfunctional breathing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mask score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Because of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, face mask is acquired in public, and many children are homeschooled. We therefore generated an 8 question survey about the frequency of wearing mask, breathing difficulties while wearing a mask, and weather there is a lock down of school and sports while survey is taken. Questions are scored from 0-3 points, where 0 is Best and 3 is worst</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ5)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ5 contains 5 questions regarding asthma symptoms. Each question is scored between 0-6 points, where 0 represents very good asthma control and 6 represents poor asthma control. Total ACQ score is calculates as an average of points.</description>

    <measure>Standardised body mass index (BMI_SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index is calculated as weight ( kg)/ Height ( m) ^2. As BMI changes with age, BMI standard deviation BMI_SDS is calculated from Danish Reference Material : (Tinggaard J, Aksglaede L, Sørensen K, et al (2014) The 2014 Danish references from birth to 20 years for height, weight and body mass index.
