      This trial is focusing on blood pressure control for patients with high blood pressure&#xD;
      (hypertension) during the COVID-19 pandemic when seeing a doctor for advice may be difficult.&#xD;
      The study utilises remote consultations by telephone or video conferencing. Patients record&#xD;
      blood pressure and data into an electronic diary on their phone which is reviewed in&#xD;
      consultations every 2 weeks by a clinician. Medication for this trial is amlodipine as an&#xD;
      oral solution which is uptitrated accordingly for patients receiving medication (anticipated&#xD;
      200). 800 patients will be in an observational group recording the same readings and will not&#xD;
      receive any medication.&#xD;

      Given the urgent need for effective monitoring and medical management of hypertension during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic, this study will test the feasibility of remote screening and&#xD;
      onboarding to remote medical management of hypertension utilizing personalised digital diary&#xD;
      record assisted optimisation of Blood Pressure control. Having remote screened a large number&#xD;
      of participants, we then test the effect of a very gentle addition of amlodipine 1mg/ml oral&#xD;
      solution to the regimes of a subgroup of asymptomatic participants with inadequate BP&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of participants screened for the study will continue in follow-up and may be&#xD;
      offered further developments as may be possible through development of the digital diary and&#xD;
      a more comprehensive adaptive protocol which allows for further interventions (such as stop&#xD;
      meds at onset of symptoms, or swap on or off ACE/ARB medications etc). Remote monitoring of&#xD;
      blood pressure has been shown in times of normal healthcare access to improve blood pressure&#xD;
      control, we will assess if the digital diary allows us to help during lockdown/reduced&#xD;
      healthcare access and improve blood pressure with amlodipine without the need for blood tests&#xD;
      or social contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amlodipine is a calcium-channel blocking drug which reduces blood pressure by relaxing blood&#xD;
      vessels (especially veins) but this same effect makes it prone to causing fluid accumulation&#xD;
      (oedema) in the lower limbs. There is a large amount of evidence on its effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety in reducing blood pressure and in treating stable angina. There appears to be a close&#xD;
      relationship between wanted and unwanted effects. Finding the best dose of amlodipine for a&#xD;
      patient could be useful in optimizing their blood pressure treatment. At present the tablet&#xD;
      doses available are only 5mg and 10mg in the UK. The present study will also investigate the&#xD;
      tolerability of side effects and the relationship of these to the prescribed dose of&#xD;
      amlodipine. It will measure the side effects of ankle swelling, headache and any other&#xD;
      reported side effects using visual analogue scales. The study will utilise a selection of&#xD;
      questionnaires to investigate the relationship between participant beliefs about medicines&#xD;
      and participants' adherence. The hypothesis of the study is that participants' tolerability&#xD;
      of side effects (as measured by VAS) will be related to their beliefs about the necessity of&#xD;
      medication (necessity concerns), their concerns about side effects and their adherence to&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with uncontrolled blood pressure (systolic =&gt;140 mmHg and/or diastolic =&gt;90&#xD;
      mmHg) on their existing prescription antihypertensive (&gt;= 1 drug) are eligible for the&#xD;
      interventional arm of this study. This interventional arm of this study will assess&#xD;
      introduction and titration of amlodipine doses within the current maximum licensed dose of&#xD;
      10mg (although higher doses are used in specialist clinics for selected participants).&#xD;
      Amlodipine liquid formulation (oral solution) will be used to permit dosing in 1-2mg&#xD;
      intervals for optimization of blood pressure control and side effects. Participants will use&#xD;
      their standard home blood pressure monitors (a home blood pressure monitor can be provided as&#xD;
      appropriate) and will be asked to measure their blood pressure in the morning (three&#xD;
      readings) before taking their antihypertensive medication (trough treatment) and again in the&#xD;
      evening (three readings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will participate in remote teleconference consultations (telephone or electronic&#xD;
      platform according to participant preference and familiarity, such as Zoom/MS Teams/&#xD;
      WhatsApp/ Facetime) with the William Harvey Clinical Research Centre (WHCRC) at least&#xD;
      2-weekly, following initial (remote) screening with clinical history taking, review of home&#xD;
      blood pressure measurements and a thorough review of all information reported by the&#xD;
      participant in the digital diary from a 5 day run-in period (see Section 11.6). Remote&#xD;
      consultations remain frequent for those participants with poor BP control, but will be less&#xD;
      frequent (monthly) for those who have stable blood pressure (defined as above BP&lt;= 140/90)&#xD;
      and are followed in the observational arm of the study.&#xD;
