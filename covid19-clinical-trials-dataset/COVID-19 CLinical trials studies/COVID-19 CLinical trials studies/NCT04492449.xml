      This research aims to investigate the incidence, clinical condition, mode of transmission and&#xD;
      laboratory data of women and their babies, who were exposed to COVID-19 infection during&#xD;
      pregnancy. This project will consist of 4 subprojects, being that Subprojects 1 and 2, will&#xD;
      be of the observational, longitudinal type of prospective Cohort; Subproject 3 will be of&#xD;
      prevalence; Subproject 4 will be case-control. Subproject 1- This study aims to assess&#xD;
      periodontal condition and quality of life before and after delivery of women with excess&#xD;
      weight gain or not, with exposure to coronavirus-sars-cov2. Subproject 2- Identify the&#xD;
      proteins differentially expressed in saliva associated with COVID-19 infection during the 3rd&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy in obese and eutrophic patients. Subproject 3- Assess the prevalence&#xD;
      of congenital syndrome in babies associated with the presumed maternal infection with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Subproject 4- Case-control study in which newborns are submitted to clinical&#xD;
      examination, being a group with congenital malformations and their respective controls and an&#xD;
      interview with the mother was carried out.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be included pregnant women who are in the third trimester of pregnancy&#xD;
      (from the 27th gestational week), aged 18-40 years, with regular follow-up with the&#xD;
      obstetrician and who present adequate systemic health during pregnancy, without the need for&#xD;
      absolute rest. In subprojects 1 and 2, pregnant women who tested positive for IgM and IgG&#xD;
      serology will be evaluated. Pregnant women who test positive (n = 60) and pregnant women who&#xD;
      test negative (n = 60) for coronavirus sars-cov-2 will be selected, making a total of 120&#xD;
      pregnant women. In project 1 the sample will be divided into 4 groups of pregnant women: GOC-&#xD;
      with excessive weight gain and with COVID19 (n = 30), GOSC- without excessive weight gain and&#xD;
      COVID19, GNC- without excessive weight gain and with COVID19 (n = 30) and GNSC- without&#xD;
      excessive weight gain and without COVID19 (n = 30). For subproject 2 that will have proteomic&#xD;
      analysis, the number of 10 patients for each group (GOC, GOSC, GNC and GNSC) will be adopted&#xD;
      according to previous protocols for saliva proteomic analysis. Subprojects 3 and 4 will&#xD;
      consist of babies, to identify possible congenital changes during the fetal period. In&#xD;
      subproject 3, the 120 babies of the pregnant women participating in the study will be divided&#xD;
      into BC (n = 60) and BSC (n = 60), which will be evaluated for the occurrence of the&#xD;
      congenital syndrome associated with the presumed maternal infection by coronavirus sars-&#xD;
      cov-2. In project 4, the sample will consist of 20 babies with congenital malformations for&#xD;
      the case group (BM) and 20 control babies without congenital malformations (BSM), exposed to&#xD;
      COVID19.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Interdental CAL is detectable at ≥2 non-adjacent teeth, or buccal CAL ≥3 mm with pocketing &gt;3 mm is detectable at ≥2 teeth. After, periodontitis will be classified in stages I, II, III and IV of periodontitis.</time_frame>
    <description>Probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) will be assessed. The PPD will be measured from the free gingival margin to the bottom of the periodontal pocket, and CAL will be measured from the cementoenamel junction to the base of the periodontal pocket, at six dental sites (mesial buccal/lingual, cervical buccal/lingual, distal buccal/lingual) excluding the third molars.</description>
