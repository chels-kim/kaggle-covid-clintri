  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called&#xD;
      allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) to provide&#xD;
      immune support against COVID-19. The study purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      five IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with no signs of COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blinded, Clinical Trial to Assess&#xD;
      Efficacy of HB-adMSCs to Provide Immune Support Against Coronavirus Disease. 100 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Eligible participants are at high or very high exposure risk of contracting&#xD;
      COVID-19. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide immune support against COVID-19,&#xD;
      measured by the percentage of subjects that develop symptoms of COVID-19. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by standard clinical laboratories&#xD;
      and inflammatory markers. Participants will complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and&#xD;
      depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires.&#xD;

               -  First responders, health care delivery and support staff (e.g., law enforcement,&#xD;
                  fire fighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who must&#xD;
                  enter patients' rooms) exposed to individuals potentially having COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mortuary workers involved in preparing (e.g., for burial or cremation) the bodies&#xD;
                  of people who are known to have, or suspected of having, COVID-19 at the time of&#xD;
                  their death&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Very High-Risk Exposure jobs are those with high potential for exposure to known or&#xD;
             suspected sources of COVID-19 during specific medical, postmortem or laboratory&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Health care workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, paramedics, emergency&#xD;
                  medical technicians) performing aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation,&#xD;
                  cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams or&#xD;
                  invasive specimen collection) on known or suspected COVID-19 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Health care or laboratory personnel collecting or handling specimens from known&#xD;
                  or suspected COVID-19 patients (e.g., manipulating cultures from known or&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Morgue workers performing autopsies, which generally involve aerosol-generating&#xD;
                  procedures, on the bodies of people who are known to have, or suspected of&#xD;
                  having, COVID-19 at the time of their death&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No signs or symptoms of infection, including but not limited to, body temperature &gt;100&#xD;
             F and pulse rate &gt; 100 BPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study&#xD;
             procedures.--Agrees to the collection of venous blood per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agrees to conformational testing for SARS-CoV-2 before end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating, or those who are not pregnant but do not take&#xD;
             effective contraceptive measures&#xD;

             investigational drug within the previous 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide informed consent or to comply with test requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site PI or&#xD;
             sub-investigator, precludes study participation. Including acute, subacute,&#xD;
             intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that would place the subject at&#xD;
             an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of&#xD;
             the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's&#xD;
             successful completion of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a stem cell treatment within one year.&#xD;
