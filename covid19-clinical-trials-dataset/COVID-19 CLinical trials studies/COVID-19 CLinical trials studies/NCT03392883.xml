      Conduct systematic, multi-site mental health implementation research in both rural and urban&#xD;
      primary care settings with a broad group of stakeholders in the US and Latin America.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to launch and evaluate a new mental health service delivery model in&#xD;
      Latin America. Specifically, in this new multi-component, mental health service delivery&#xD;
      intervention, the investigators propose to: (1) harness mobile behavioral health technology&#xD;
      for mental health (with a primary focus on depression and a secondary focus on problematic&#xD;
      alcohol and other substance abuse), (2) launch new workforce training and service delivery&#xD;
      models (including the integration of technology into service delivery), (3) launch and evolve&#xD;
      an integrated data management system for systematic data tracking and outcomes assessment,&#xD;
      and (4) launch and grow a learning collaborative of organizations integrating mental health&#xD;
      into primary care. The investigators will launch this project at multiple primary care sites&#xD;
      in various parts of Colombia, with a plan to inform subsequent adoption in several other&#xD;
      Latin American countries, including Chile and Peru.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will initially pilot test this mental health service delivery model at a single primary care site and then refine the model based on pilot data. The investigators will then expand implementation across 6 Colombia-based healthcare sites in urban and rural communities (including approximately 2000 participants). Consistent with a modified stepped wedge design (multiple baseline design), the investigators will implement the model across sites on a staggered basis and expand the number of sites in which the investigators implement over time. By conducting this multi-site implementation research project, the investigators can assess the extent to which the implementation model and associated outcomes are replicable across sites and/or the extent to which the model needs to be modified for differing contexts.</intervention_model_description>

The investigators agree to cooperate with the NIMH program staff to provide timely, accurate, and complete data for purposes of monitoring the progress of research activities conducted within the proposed project. The investigators will also work with NIH program staff to promote broad availability of policies, practices, materials, tools and data generated by the proposed project activities. At the conclusion of this study, the investigators plan to make available a public use file of all related study data (stripped of all personal identifiers and suitable for use by other investigators).

    <ipd_time_frame>Data will become available at the conclusion of the study. The investigators agree to retain records for each completed study for a minimum of 3 years (or more if necessary) after study data lock. The investigators will also comply with all relevant Institutional Review Board(s) IRB(s) and other regulatory entities regarding data sharing and records retention.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Although the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, the investigators will further assure participants' confidentiality with a data sharing agreement that stipulates that all data and associated documentation will only be available to users who declare: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.
