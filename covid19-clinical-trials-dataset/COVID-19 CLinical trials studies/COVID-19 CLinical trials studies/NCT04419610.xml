    <textblock>
      To determine whether the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infection is driven by&#xD;
      overactivation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be run as a double-blind, randomized controlled experimental medicine&#xD;
      study in male and female hospitalised (n=60) aged 18 or over, with confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Patients who are admitted due to confirmed COVID-19 infection will be screened&#xD;
      with a routine medical assessment (see Table 1) and enrolled if they meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Subjects will be block randomised based on age to continuous intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of placebo or TRV027 for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 procedures can occur on the same day of screening and include a venous blood test prior&#xD;
      to commencing an intravenous infusion of either placebo or TRV027 at 12mg/hr. The infusions&#xD;
      will continue for 7 days. Venous blood tests will be repeated at days 3, 5 and 8, amounting&#xD;
      to approximately 120mLs of blood in total over the 8-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the infusion has finished, the subjects will remain in hospital for a further 24 hours&#xD;
      for vital signs and adverse event monitoring. If a subject exits the trial before the 7-day&#xD;
      infusion finishes, they will be advised to remain in hospital for a 24 hour period for&#xD;
      monitoring. Subjects will be followed up on Day 30 either via telephone or via medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in COVID-19 infection has been widely&#xD;
      discussed for two reasons. First, SARS-COV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, invades type II&#xD;
      pneumocytes in the lung by binding to an enzyme called angiotensin converting enzyme 2&#xD;
      (ACE2). As the virus enters the cell, via one of its receptors, ACE2, it is thought that this&#xD;
      is internalised and is hence unable to perform its physiological action of converting&#xD;
      Angiotensin II (AngII) to Ang(1-7). Second, it has been noted that severe COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      has many features which are strikingly similar to the effects of overactivation of the RAS.&#xD;
      Indeed, these features are apparent in preclinical models using AngII infusions and include&#xD;
      lung injury, lung inflammation, myocardial microinfarcts, characteristic glomerular&#xD;
      thrombosis and coagulopathy. The coagulopathy is particularly noteworthy given an early&#xD;
      increase in D-Dimer has very high positive predictor value for death in COVID-19, and D-dimer&#xD;
      concentrations are unusually high in COVID-19, over and above what would be expected for an&#xD;
      acute phase response or a pneumonia caused by a respiratory virus such as influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AngII and Ang(1-7) affect various aspects of the coagulation system including platelets and&#xD;
      endothelial cells, and we therefore hypothesise that overaction of RAS is partly responsible&#xD;
      for the coagulopathy present in COVID-19 infection. Because the over activation of the RAS in&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection is due to both Angiotensin II excess and Ang(1-7) depletion, standard&#xD;
      tools to modulate RAS (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blockers) cannot be used to test this hypothesis as they address the Angiotensin II excess,&#xD;
      but not the Ang(1-7) depletion. TRV027 is a similar peptide to Ang(1-7) but is a much more&#xD;
      potent biased agonist at AT1R than Ang(1-7) and would be expected to oppose the effects of&#xD;
      AngII accumulation, and functionally correct the Ang(1-7) deficiency. Hence it is an&#xD;
      appropriate tool to examine the link between RAS activation and coagulopathy in the context&#xD;
      of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
