      Rationale: Currently there are no approved treatments for COVID-19. In the Dutch treatment&#xD;
      protocol guideline (SWAB) designated treatment is supportive care with the option to add&#xD;
      chloroquine base (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). CQ and HCQ are implemented because of&#xD;
      their in vitro activity, results from small animal studies, and anecdotal patient's data.&#xD;
      There are no published randomized studies with these medications in patients with disease&#xD;
      caused by any coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate if treatment with only supportive care or addition of one of two&#xD;
      anti-COVID_19 agents (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) results in less disease progression&#xD;
      in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicentre, cluster randomized cross-over, open label trial. Hospitals will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment arms in sequential periods of one week: chloroquine&#xD;
      base versus hydroxychloroquine versus supportive care without any drug presumed active&#xD;
      against SARS-COV-2. Patients will be treated based on the date of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adults aged of 18 years and older with moderate to severe, with a NEWS-2&#xD;
      score ≤ 5, laboratory confirmed COVID-19, who require hospital admission in a ward outside&#xD;
      the Medium Care or Intensive Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Depending on the treatment arm, the study subject will receive&#xD;
      only supportive care or an addition with one of the two agents active against SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Disease progression defined as a NEWS-2 score ≥ 7 within 14&#xD;
      days, or admission to Medium Care or Intensive Care Unit, or death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study rationale CQ and HCQ were both employed in the treatment of COVID-19 in China. Based on&#xD;
      unpublished anecdotal positive results in China, CQ is now implemented in China and the&#xD;
      Netherlands in severe COVID-19. HCQ is an analog of CQ with more anti-viral effectivity ex&#xD;
      vivo, better safety and tolerability profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the employment of CQ and HCQ in China comes from the fact that both reduce&#xD;
      COVID-19 replication ex-vivo. On top of this, both drugs have clear immunomodulating effects&#xD;
      (which is used for various indications to treat rheumatologic diseases) and have shown&#xD;
      promising results in patients with dengue and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in the Dutch guidelines, for moderate severely ill patients CQ base is the first&#xD;
      line of therapy for patients admitted in hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time needed to &quot;load&quot; the body when using CQ and thus the possible late onset of action&#xD;
      suggests that initiation of treatment should be timely. Moreover, the hypothesized mode of&#xD;
      action suggests that both HCQ and CQ inhibit cellular replication of COVID-19 but do not have&#xD;
      an intrinsic effect on the virus, thus could be best employed when the viral load is low&#xD;
      (i.e. early phase of the disease) and thus safe time to improve the subsequent immune&#xD;
      response. This underlines that both drugs should be implemented early rather than late in the&#xD;
      course of SARS-COV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a cluster randomized controlled study evaluating the value of&#xD;
      chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine compared to no antiviral therapy in admitted patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, with moderate to severe symptoms and&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital and a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5, will be available for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three treatment arms contain standard supportive care during hospital admission with in&#xD;
      two arms an addition with either chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Despite the&#xD;
      inclusion of CQ and HCQ as possible additional treatment for COVID-19 in the Dutch treatment&#xD;
      guideline, there's no conclusion on the best treatment strategy in this population. Based on&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic modelling, and the safety profile, HCQ seems to be more promising than CQ,&#xD;
      but both drugs have to be studied in relation to COVID-19. Furthermore, the availability of&#xD;
      both drugs might differ from country to country; in the Netherlands for instance, chloroquine&#xD;
      is widely available. Therefore, a 1:1:1 trial including standard supportive care with in&#xD;
      addition CQ or HCQ as suggested in the LCI/SWAB guideline, the optimal dosages in the&#xD;
      different treatment arms are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Supportive care + chloroquine base arm: loading dose 600mg, followed by 300mg 12 hours&#xD;
           later, followed by 300mg bid for 4 days; total treatment duration of 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supportive care + hydroxychloroquine arm: loading dose 400mg bid, followed by 200mg bid&#xD;
           for 4 days; total treatment duration of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Supportive care only. Dosage of chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine will be adjusted, if&#xD;
           the patients has a renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGDR)&#xD;
           &lt;10, to 50% of the initial dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient will be discharged from hospital before the end of the treatment, treatment is&#xD;
      continued outside of the hospital. The general practitioner will receive note of the&#xD;
      treatment at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main studyendpoint Composite endpoint with disease progression defined as a NEWS2score ≥ 7&#xD;
      within 14 days or resulting in admission to Intensive/Medium Care unit or resulting in death&#xD;
      within 14 days.&#xD;
