      Veterans have a high risk of developing lung in comparison to general populations due to&#xD;
      their older age and smoking history. Recent evidence indicates that lung cancer screening&#xD;
      with low dose CT scan reduces lung cancer mortality among older heavy smokers. However, the&#xD;
      rates of false positive findings are high, requiring further testing and evaluation.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies report that while some Veterans are enthusiastic about screening, others&#xD;
      are highly reluctant. Patient preferences should be considered as part of an informed&#xD;
      decision making process for this emerging paradigm of lung cancer control. Effective methods&#xD;
      for preference assessment among Veterans have not yet been developed, evaluated, and&#xD;
      integrated into clinical practice. The specific aims of this study are to 1) elicit patient&#xD;
      and provider stakeholder input to inform the development of a lung cancer screening decision&#xD;
      tool, 2) develop a web based Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool (LCSDecTool) that&#xD;
      incorporates patient and provider input, and 3) evaluate the impact of the LCSDecTool&#xD;
      compared to usual care on the decision process, clinical outcomes, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (5/8/18)-This project involves the recruitment of both Veterans as well as health care&#xD;
      providers/leaders. Patient recruitment efforts at both sites will target male and female&#xD;
      patients enrolled in a Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) who are eligible for lung cancer&#xD;
      screening. Our recruitment goals for patients are 40% African American, 5% Hispanic patients,&#xD;
      and 10% women.&#xD;

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Recent clinical&#xD;
      trials provide evidence that screening with low dose CT scans will decrease lung cancer and&#xD;
      all cause mortality among older heavy smokers. Clinical guidelines have been issued with the&#xD;
      USPSTF recommending annual screening from age 55 to 80 for those with 30 pack years or more&#xD;
      of smoking or who quit less than 15 years ago. Evidence clearly delineates both the benefits&#xD;
      (mortality reduction) and harms (false positives, follow-up testing, risk of invasive&#xD;
      testing, and risk of overdiagnosis) of lung cancer screening. Preliminary data from an HSR&amp;D&#xD;
      pilot grant finds that some Veterans are highly reluctant to enter the care pathway&#xD;
      associated with lung cancer screening due to its potential harms. Additional preliminary data&#xD;
      using Best Worst Scaling in older smokers demonstrate groups of patients who place greater&#xD;
      importance on harms than benefit when considering lung cancer screening. Preference&#xD;
      assessment methods can help Veterans to weigh benefits and harms, consider the clinical&#xD;
      pathway they are entering, anticipate future health states, and communicate these values to&#xD;
      their health care providers. Although basic educational tools to inform lung cancer&#xD;
      decision-making have been developed, there is a lack of validated preference assessment tools&#xD;
      that can be integrated into the clinical setting. Building upon preference assessment methods&#xD;
      developed and validated in an HSR&amp;D pilot grant (PI-Schapira) and using a trans-disciplinary&#xD;
      approach, this team is positioned to advance the science and practice of decision support for&#xD;
      lung cancer screening in the Veteran population. The objectives of this study are to 1)&#xD;
      elicit patient and provider stakeholder input to inform the development of a lung cancer&#xD;
      screening decision tool, 2) develop a web based Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool&#xD;
      (LCSDecTool) that incorporates patient and provider input, and 3) evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      LCSDecTool compared to usual care on the decision process, clinical outcomes, and quality of&#xD;
      life. The study will be conducted in 3 phases. In phase 1, mixed methods will be used to&#xD;
      assess usability of preference assessment methods and perceived usefulness of a web based&#xD;
      lung cancer screening decision support tool among patient and provider stakeholders. In phase&#xD;
      2, an interactive web based decision support program will be developed that incorporates&#xD;
      preference assessment methods. In phase 3, a pilot RCT will be conduced to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the web based decision support program. Outcomes evaluated will include decision&#xD;
      quality as indicated by knowledge, decisional conflict, and decision regret; screening&#xD;
      behavior, clinical outcomes as indicated by anxiety, and quality of life. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted across two VA sites; West Haven-VA in Connecticut and Corporal Michael J. Crescenz&#xD;
      VA in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Results of this study will provide tools that can be used&#xD;
      to integrate lung cancer screening into clinical practice at VA Medical Centers in a patient&#xD;
      centered approach. Lung cancer screening is fundamentally different from existing screening&#xD;
      paradigms in several respects; eligibility is defined by a behavior (smoking), a high rate of&#xD;
      false positive findings is expected, and the target population is older with higher&#xD;
      comorbidity than the target population for cervical, breast, or colorectal screening. Given&#xD;
      these unique aspects of lung cancer screening, there is a critical need to develop and test&#xD;
      tools for preference assessment and informed decision making that are applicable for the VA&#xD;
      setting. The current proposal provides a mechanism to accomplish these goals. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator is working closely with the US Department of Veterans Affairs National Center&#xD;
      for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention to integrate the tools and paradigm developed to&#xD;
      primary care in the VA Medical Care System. The work builds directly upon a recently&#xD;
      completed HSR&amp;D pilot support in the area of lung cancer and shared decision making.&#xD;
