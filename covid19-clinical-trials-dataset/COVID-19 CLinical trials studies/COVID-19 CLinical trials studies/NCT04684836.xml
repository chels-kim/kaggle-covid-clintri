  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leveraging a natural experiment approach, the investigators will examine rapidly changing&#xD;
      telemedicine and in-person models of care during and after the COVID-19 crisis to determine&#xD;
      whether certain patients could safely choose to continue telemedicine or&#xD;
      telemedicine-supplemented care, rather than return to in-person care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has quickly emerged as the primary method of&#xD;
      providing outpatient care in many regions with shelter-in-place and social distancing&#xD;
      policies. It is critical to understand the impact of this rapid and widespread transition&#xD;
      from in-person to remote visits on disparities in access to primary care, especially in&#xD;
      chronic disease where ongoing communication between providers and patients is essential.&#xD;
      Also, these newly developed or expanded telemedicine programs vary widely, raising important&#xD;
      questions about the effect of these differences on uptake of telemedicine among different&#xD;
      patient populations and on patient-centered outcomes. Leveraging a natural experiment&#xD;
      approach, the investigators will examine rapidly changing telemedicine and in-person models&#xD;
      of care during and after the COVID-19 crisis to determine whether certain patients could&#xD;
      safely choose to continue telemedicine or telemedicine-supplemented care, rather than return&#xD;
      to in-person care. The overarching goals of this study are to describe the features of&#xD;
      telemedicine programs in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to use natural&#xD;
      experiment methods to provide rigorous evidence on the effects of these programs.&#xD;

    <description>Continuity of care will be measured using the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index. The Bice-Boxerman continuity of care (COC) index reflects the relative share of all of a patient's visits during the year that are billed by distinct providers and/or practices. The index ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that each visit involved a different provider than all other visits, and 1 that all visits were billed by a single provider, representing continuity of care.</description>
