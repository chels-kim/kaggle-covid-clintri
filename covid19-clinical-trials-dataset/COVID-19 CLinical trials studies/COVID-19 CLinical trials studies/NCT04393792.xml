  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is highly infectious and transmission of the virus is thought to be similar to that&#xD;
      of influenza which can be transferred through droplets released when a person coughs, sneezes&#xD;
      or talks. Studies have shown that nasal rinsing and mouth washes may be an important way to&#xD;
      deliver treatments that could reduce the amount of a virus that is present in the nose and&#xD;
      mouth. This also could mean that there is less virus available to pass on to others. We want&#xD;
      to see if the use of nose rinses and mouth washes using Povidone-Iodine will reduce the the&#xD;
      amount of virus in the nose and throat of people who have tested positive for COVID-19&#xD;
      disease and also reduce the spread of infection within their household.&#xD;

      COVID-19 is highly infectious and transmission of the virus is thought to be similar to that&#xD;
      of influenza which can be transferred through droplets released when a person coughs, sneezes&#xD;
      or talks. Studies have shown that nasal rinsing and mouth washes may be an important way to&#xD;
      deliver treatments that could reduce the amount of a virus that reaches other parts of the&#xD;
      body. This also could mean that there is less virus available to pass on to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to see if the use of nasal rinsing and mouth washes will reduce the spread of&#xD;
      infection within your household by reducing and removing the virus from your mouth and nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants have been recruited they will be randomly allocated to one of two&#xD;
      groups. Each arm will have the same number of participants. The two arms will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. nose rinse and mouthwash with Isotonic saline alone. This will be the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nose rinse and mouthwash with Povidone-Iodine taken 3 times a days for three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment begins, each participant will have one pre-treatment swab of the back of the&#xD;
      nose and the back of the throat taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once allocated each participant will be asked to have 4 further swabs of the mouth and nose&#xD;
      taken on days 2,4,7 &amp; 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be patients and healthcare staff who have tested positive for COVID-19.&#xD;
      Healthcare staff who are self isolating will also asked their co-residents/family members at&#xD;
      home to take the treatment and provide swabs in the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are patients and are admitted to hospital will be well enough to perform the&#xD;
      nasal rinses and mouth washes as treatments and provide the same swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be provided with informational videos on how to do the treatments and&#xD;
      how to take the swabs. Participants who are not healthcare staff will have swabs taken as&#xD;
      part of the local drive through testing service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to download a free smartphone app (Umotif) to upload&#xD;
      information about daily symptoms and whether they have provided swabs on the required days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swabs will be tested for the amount of virus in the labs at Hampshire Hospitals NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust and analysed to determine if the treatment arm of Povidone-Iodine is&#xD;
      reducing the amount of virus compared to the isotonic saline arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be anonymised prior to analysis. The study team will know the participants'&#xD;
      study-specific data; no personal data about participants will be used without their explicit&#xD;
      consent and only for the purposes of protocol adherence and data to answer the study&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the last swab has been taken and delivered to the laboratory, the trial will have ended&#xD;
      for that participant. Results of the swabs will be part of the study data and collated in&#xD;
      readiness for analysis by the study statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be made available for peer-reviewed publication and presentation at&#xD;
      conferences.&#xD;
