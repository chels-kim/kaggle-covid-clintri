      The objectives of this clinical study are as follows(ARDS caused by pneumonia cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective To investigate the efficacy of HLCM051 in patients with ARDS caused by&#xD;
           pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objective To confirm the safety of HLCM05 in patients with ARDS caused by&#xD;
           pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory objective To investigate changes of biomarkers in patients with ARDS caused&#xD;
           by pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients enrolled is 30 (20 patient in the HLCM051 group and 10 patients in the&#xD;
      standard therapy group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this clinical study is as follows(ARDS caused by COVID-19 cohort):&#xD;
