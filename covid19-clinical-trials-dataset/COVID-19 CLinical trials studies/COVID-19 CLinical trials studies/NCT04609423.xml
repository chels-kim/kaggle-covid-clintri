    <textblock>
      A randomized, parallel-group treatment, quadruple masked, two-arm study to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of cod liver oil compared to placebo in the prevention of Covid-19 and airway&#xD;
      infections in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will investigate whether daily cod liver oil can prevent&#xD;
      Covid-19 infections and reduce the severity of such infections. The investigators will also&#xD;
      examine whether cod liver oil prevents other airway infections in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary evidence from literature and an ongoing study in the investigators' lab suggests&#xD;
      that cod liver oil may prevent Covid-19 and complications of Covid-19. In the present study,&#xD;
      the investigators will examine whether this is actually the case by randomizing volunteers to&#xD;
      take cod liver oil or placebo (corn oil) during the winter months of 2020-2021. The&#xD;
      investigators also aim to explore whether cod liver oil can prevent other respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections, as well as explore and confirm already known health effects and possible new&#xD;
      health effects, in particular rare adverse events associated with cod liver oil use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cod liver oil is a traditional source of vitamin A, D, and E and omega-3 fatty acids and the&#xD;
      dose administered in the study will contain 250 ug vitamin A, 10 ug vitamin D, 10 mg vitamin&#xD;
      E, and 1,2 g omega-3 fatty acids.&#xD;

          -  Previous Covid-19 disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Caucasians only: Use of any supplement containing more than trace amounts of&#xD;
             vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids at inclusion (Vitamin D levels in non-Caucasians&#xD;
             living in Norway are frequently low even among those self-reporting using dietary&#xD;
             supplements). This criterion will be relaxed if too few participants volunteer for the&#xD;
             study and only Caucasians that use cod liver oil or an equivalent dietary supplement&#xD;
             (with omega 3 and vitamin D) more than 5-7 times per week will be excluded.&#xD;
