  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane using the&#xD;
      AnaConDa device on extravascular lung water index (EVLWi) and the pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      permeability index (PVPI) in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS). Improvement in oxygenation and decreases in lung inflammatory response has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in patients with ARDS compared with intravenous sedation. However,&#xD;
      preclinical data showing a decrease in lung edema has not been confirmed. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that inhaled sedation with sevoflurane reduces EVLWi and PVPI in patients with ARDS, assessed&#xD;
      with the PiCCO device. Patients will receive either inhaled sedation (interventional group),&#xD;
      or a sedation with propofol (control group). Both will be associated with remifentanil.&#xD;
      Sedation will be monitored by bispectral index with a targeted value of 30-50. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be daily assessment of EVLWi and PVPI over time in patients sedated with&#xD;
      sevoflurane compared to propofol. Secondary outcomes will include value of PVPI and EVLW at&#xD;
      48h after intubation, fluid administration, need in norepinephrine, time between cessation of&#xD;
      sedation and trial of weaning sedation, ventilation free days, mortality at day 28, the&#xD;
      partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2), plasma&#xD;
      and alveolar levels of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukine (IL)-1β, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8). These blood and alveolar samples will be done at baseline, on day 2 and on day 5. A&#xD;
      sub-group analysis will be done in Covid-19 related ARDS. Decrease in PVPI and EVLWi with&#xD;
      inhaled sevoflurane may be related to the decrease in lung edema in ARDS patients and may&#xD;
      ultimately improve patient outcome.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled sedation with volatile anesthetic agents has been proposed as an efficient and safe&#xD;
      alternative to usual intravenous sedation such as propofol or midazolam in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) models, preclinical studies comparing&#xD;
      inhaled sedation to intravenous sedation showed that sedation with sevoflurane improves&#xD;
      oxygenation, reduces the lung and systemic inflammatory response, decreases formation of&#xD;
      alveolar edema and is associated with a less pronounced increase in extravascular lung water&#xD;
      (EVLW, the amount of water contained in the lungs outside the pulmonary vasculature) or&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI), the ratio of EVLW over the pulmonary blood&#xD;
      volume). Although benefits of inhaled sedation on inflammation and oxygenation have been&#xD;
      shown in humans, its direct effect on EVLW or PVPI has never been evaluated in patients with&#xD;
      ARDS. It could be important as their levels are factors independently associated with&#xD;
      mortality in patients with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane in comparison with sedation with&#xD;
      propofol on the degree of PVPI and the amount of EVLW in patients with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that inhaled sedation with sevoflurane reduces PVPI and EVLW in patients&#xD;
      with ARDS compared to sedation with propofol.&#xD;
