  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services globally. The hospital services&#xD;
      include surgeries for benign diseases, cancer surgery and obstetric surgery. A study&#xD;
      conducted by CovidSurg Collaborative estimated that 28,404,603 operations would be cancelled&#xD;
      or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19. Globally, 81.7% of&#xD;
      benign surgery, 37.7% of cancer surgery and 25.4% of elective Caesarean sections would be&#xD;
      cancelled or postponed. If countries increase their normal surgical volume by 20%&#xD;
      post-pandemic, it would take a median 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting&#xD;
      from COVID-19 disruption. This study aims to estimate total number of elective operations&#xD;
      postponed during COVID-19 in geriatric population.&#xD;

      An audit study will be conducted among geriatric patients that are admitted for elective&#xD;
      surgeries in University Malaya Medical center (UMMC). Patients who fulfil inclusion/&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be recruited with consent and will have a face-to-face interview in&#xD;
      the surgical ward prior to their elective surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection in the form of a questionnaire designed in English and filled up by the&#xD;
      research interviewer is created to document patient demography, surgical details and level of&#xD;
      depression/ anxiety prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to find incidence of elective surgeries has postponed&#xD;
      during COVID-19 pandemic in geriatric population. This overarching aim raises two secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find the incidents of cancer surgeries postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in&#xD;
           geriatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find the physical and psychological impact of postponed elective surgery in geriatric&#xD;
           population during COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random convenience sampling will be conducted. Data will be collected using REDCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture) system and analyzed using SPSS software. Results will be presented&#xD;
      as mean Â± standard deviation, median or frequency (percentages) as appropriate. Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test will be used for non-normally distributed data while t test will be used for normally&#xD;
      distributed data. The qualitative data analysis will be performed using chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test if insufficient numbers are present. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>Two scores will be used:&#xD;
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) with response in a 4-point scale (from 0 to 3) referring to overt symptoms within the last week. The total score for each component ( anxiety and depression) will be summed up to give an outcome such as 0-7 normal, 8-10 borderline abnormal and 11- 21 as abnormal.&#xD;
SF-36 with 36 questions to cover eight domains of health.&#xD;
Limitations in physical activities.&#xD;
Limitations in social activities&#xD;
Limitations in usual role activities&#xD;
Bodily pain&#xD;
General mental health (psychological distress and well-being)&#xD;
Limitations in usual role activities&#xD;
Vitality (energy and fatigue)&#xD;
General health perceptions Eight scaled scores with each directly transformed into a 0-100 scale, lower scores mean more disabiity.</description>
