      A total of 25 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 80 with no previous history of&#xD;
      COVID-19 will be entered into the study and will receive IPV by injection on Day 1. Blood&#xD;
      specimens collected pre-inoculation will be tested for cross-reactivity to poliovirus and&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 by Western blot. An additional specimen will be collected on Day 28&#xD;
      post-inoculation and, likewise tested for cross-reactivity to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects with an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens following inoculation&#xD;
      with IPV will be summarized.&#xD;

      A total of 25 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 80 with no previous history of&#xD;
      COVID-19 will be entered into the study and will receive IPV by injection on Day 1. Blood&#xD;
      specimens collected pre-inoculation will be tested for cross-reactivity to poliovirus and&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 by Western blot. An additional specimen will be collected on Day 28&#xD;
      post-inoculation and, likewise tested for cross-reactivity to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results from this study demonstrate that polio vaccine induces an immune response&#xD;
      against both the immunogen (poliovirus) and SARS-CoV-2, the study may be amended after&#xD;
      consultation with the Center for Biologics evaluation and research (CBER), to enroll an&#xD;
      additional 275 subjects. Expansion of the original cohort will be stratified by age and&#xD;
      race/ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects with an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens following inoculation&#xD;
      with IPV will be summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination for poliomyelitis is part of routine childhood vaccination. Only IPV has been&#xD;
      administered in the United States since the year 2000 as a series of 4 inoculations in&#xD;
      childhood inducing an immunity which, although protective for years, wans over time and is,&#xD;
      for the most part, undetectable in adults unless a booster is administered. United States&#xD;
      residents are advised to receive a booster prior to travelling to countries where polio&#xD;
      disease remains endemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inactivated vaccines against RNA viruses (including Poliovirus and coronavirus) induce an&#xD;
      immune response that recognizes the non-structural antigens of the inactivated viral&#xD;
      particle. There is extensive homology between Poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) both within the coding regions and illustrated in the&#xD;
      3-dimensional modeling. The homology between the viral epitopes may be sufficient such that&#xD;
      adults who receive a polio booster develop an immune response that cross-reacts with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, the neutralizing activity of antibodies raised to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp&#xD;
      will be evaluated.To evaluate and characterize the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 elicited in&#xD;
      adults by IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate whether an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is induced in&#xD;
      adults receiving a booster inoculation of IPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:: To evaluate the neutralizing activity of antibodies raised to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 RdRp&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-site study in a clinic in San Diego California that routinely diagnoses and&#xD;
      manages patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
