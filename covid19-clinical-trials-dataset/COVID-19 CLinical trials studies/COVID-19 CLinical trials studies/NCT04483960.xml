      An International Multi-Centre Randomised Adaptive Platform Clinical Trial to Assess the&#xD;
      Clinical, Virological and Immunological Outcomes in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection&#xD;
      (COVID-19).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASCOT is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled adaptive&#xD;
      platform trial. The study design will allow harmonisation with existing frameworks such as&#xD;
      the Sentinel Travellers Research Preparedness Platform for Emerging Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      (SETREP-ID) and the Randomised, embedded, multifactorial adaptive platform trial for&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platform trials allow multiple questions to be evaluated simultaneously and sequentially&#xD;
      within the platform, and evaluate interaction between different treatment options, to achieve&#xD;
      the goal of determining the optimal combination of treatments for the disease as rapidly as&#xD;
      possible. The overarching objective of ASCOT-ADAPT is to identify the regimen (combination of&#xD;
      interventions) associated with the highest chance of survival free of advanced respiratory&#xD;
      support or vasopressor / inotropic support at 28 days after randomisation, in adults&#xD;
      hospitalised with COVID-19 but not requiring ICU-level care at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial implementation of the adaptive platform, recruiting sites have the option to&#xD;
      participate in one or more of three treatment domains. Consented participants will then be&#xD;
      able to choose whether to be enrolled into one or more available domains concurrently.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomised to the corresponding interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention domain A (antiviral):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised using response adaptive randomisation (RAR) on day 1 to&#xD;
      receive either i) standard of care without nafamostat; or ii) standard of care with&#xD;
      nafamostat&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention domain B (antibody):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised using response adaptive randomisation (RAR) on day 1 to&#xD;
      receive either i) standard of care without convalescent plasma; or ii) standard of care with&#xD;
      convalescent plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention domain C (anticoagulation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised using response adaptive randomisation (RAR) on day 1 to&#xD;
      receive either i) standard dose thromboprophylaxis; or ii) intermediate dose&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis; or iii) standard dose thromboprophylaxis plus aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily data will be collected for the first 28 days or until discharge, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
      There will be a core dataset collected for all patients at all sites and enhanced and&#xD;
      research data and biological samples for sites with capacity. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      up at Day 90.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Death from any cause or requirement of new intensive respiratory support (invasive or non-invasive ventilation) or vasopressor/inotropic support.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>This includes any participant who receives non-invasive mechanical ventilation (either CPAP or BIPAP, apart from the below considerations) any time after enrolment even if not transferred to ICU. It does NOT include the use of humidified high-flow nasal prong oxygen.&#xD;
Participants on pre-existing home BiPAP or CPAP will not be considered to have met the primary outcome unless they have either i. required invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e. intubation), or ii. graduated from CPAP only whilst asleep to BiPAP at any time, or iii. graduated from BiPAP only whilst asleep to BiPAP for &gt;12 hours/day, or iv. died by day 28</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to clinical recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the first day, during the 28 days after enrolment, on which a patient satisfies categories 1, 2, or 3 on the WHO eight-point ordinal outcome scale. For the purposes of this outcome measure, it will be assumed that the participant is not hospitalised on the first day following discharge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>WHO 8-point ordinal outcome scale</measure>

    <description>The ordinal score is:&#xD;
Not hospitalised, no limitations on activities&#xD;
Not hospitalised, limitation on activities&#xD;
Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care (used if hospitalization was extended for infection control purposes)&#xD;
Hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or other medical conditions)&#xD;
Hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen&#xD;
Hospitalised, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices&#xD;
Hospitalised, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO&#xD;
Death.&#xD;
Admission to a Hospital in the Home unit is not counted as hospitalisation for the purposes of this ordinal scale. Patients who have been admitted to hospital and transferred to a Hospital in the Home unit will be assessed as either ordinal score 1 or 2.</description>

Ordinal comparison of the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale:&#xD;
Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale for grading the severity of breathlessness during daily activities:&#xD;
0 - I only get breathless with strenuous exercise&#xD;
- I get short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill&#xD;
- On level ground, I walk slower than people of the same age because of breathlessness, or I have to stop for breath when walking at my own pace on the level&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Platform Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Admitted to an acute-care hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid testing in the past 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to be randomised within 14 days of symptom onset&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least one symptom or sign attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Overall platform exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Currently receiving acute intensive respiratory support (invasive or non-invasive&#xD;
             mechanical ventilation) or vasopressor/inotropic support. Note, participants already&#xD;
             on community based non-invasive ventilation (either CPAP or BiPAP) can still be&#xD;
             recruited. Humidified high flow nasal oxygen will not be considered an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous participation in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Treating team deems enrolment in the study is not in the best interests of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Death is deemed to be imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Either the patient or their primary treating clinician are not committed to active&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This criterion seeks to exclude those patients where supportive comfort measures only are&#xD;
        being provided. Patients who are planned for active ward management with a clear aim to&#xD;
        improve survival, even if intensive care unit level support is not being offered, should&#xD;
        still be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Domain A (Antiviral) intervention-level exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria that exclude a patient from one or more interventions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nafamostat:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known current decompensated liver disease (Child-Pugh B or C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The treating clinician intends to continue or commence therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A current or recurrent condition with a high risk of major bleeding (e.g. bleeding&#xD;
             disorder), or a baseline coagulation profile (within the previous 3 days) that&#xD;
             indicates a high risk of bleeding, that would be considered a contraindication to&#xD;
             receive therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum Potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/L (based on most recent blood test result collected as part&#xD;
             of routine care within the previous 3 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum Sodium &lt;120 mmol/L (based on most recent blood test result collected as part of&#xD;
             routine care within the previous 3 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to nafamostat&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
