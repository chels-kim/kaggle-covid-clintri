  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus named COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), one of the lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract samples was detected in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared&#xD;
      it a global epidemic on March 11, 2020, due to the emergence of COVID-19 cases in 113&#xD;
      countries other than China, where the first epidemic occurred, and the spread and severity of&#xD;
      the virus. Pregnancy increases susceptibility to respiratory complications of viral diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the demographic data of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      undergoing cesarean section, our anesthesia practices, complications, and condition of&#xD;
      neonates, and to summarize up-to-date information on COVID-19 in obstetric anesthesia.&#xD;

      Our study was a single-center, retrospective, and observational trial and carried out with&#xD;
      the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patient demographics and information about&#xD;
      anesthesia were analyzed retrospectively from the patient files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were operated in negative pressure operating theatres reserved for them. The&#xD;
      whole team was equipped with Level 3 personal protective equipment (PPE) (liquid-proof apron,&#xD;
      N-95 mask, goggles, visor, overshoes). Anesthesia was administered by 2 healthcare&#xD;
      professionals from the anesthesia team, including an experienced anesthesiologist and an&#xD;
      assistant anesthesia technician. A third person was kept ready outside to help in case of&#xD;
      need.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who underwent cesarean section and had positive PCR nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients who tested negative and were clinically suspicious were excluded from the study. PCR test was not performed on all elective and emergency pregnant women to be taken for cesarean section in our hospital. It was only applied to patients with symptoms or patients who were suspected. All patient demographics and information about anesthesia were analyzed retrospectively from the patient files.</description>
