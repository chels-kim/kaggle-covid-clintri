      Nasal saline irrigations are a safe and commonly used mechanism to treat a variety of&#xD;
      sinonasal diseases including sinusitis, rhinitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.&#xD;
      When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the&#xD;
      counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby shampoo has been found to be a safe&#xD;
      additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses which&#xD;
      may help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many systemic medications and treatments have been proposed for COVID-19, there has not&#xD;
      yet been a study looking at targeted local intervention to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx&#xD;
      where the viral load is the highest. Studies have shown that the use of simple over the&#xD;
      counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in the setting of viral URIs,&#xD;
      including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2). Further, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped&#xD;
      virus, mild-detergent application with nasal saline would neutralize the virus further. It is&#xD;
      our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with baby shampoo irrigations may decrease&#xD;
      viral shedding/viral load and viral transmission, secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      inflammation in patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease process COVID-19&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease 2019) was first seen in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Over the following&#xD;
      months, it quickly spread across the continent and, in short order, the globe, making an&#xD;
      impact that hasn't been seen in generations. Although coronaviruses have been prevalent for&#xD;
      millennia, this version is immunologically novel, and thus there is no natural immunity to&#xD;
      the virus. This has been a major reason for its rapid spread across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous members of the coronavirus family have typically caused upper respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      such as the common cold, though there have also been more virulent versions of this virus&#xD;
      seen in the recent past, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle&#xD;
      East Respiratory Syndrome). Similarly named, SARS-CoV-2 also causes upper respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms but has varied from the previous viral syndromes in a number of ways including how&#xD;
      quickly it has been able to transmit within a population. This is a disease that does not&#xD;
      segregate and can affect all ages, genders, and ethnicities. Everyone is susceptible to this&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for respiratory viruses are also being rapidly&#xD;
      developed and polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) diagnostics and multiplex assays are&#xD;
      increasingly used in clinical laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 clinical detection and subtyping.&#xD;
      Rapid antigenic and genetic evolution has been expected for SARS-CoV-2 strains, and a better&#xD;
      understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics is needed to establish an effective&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our present understanding of the nature and extent of the upper respiratory track (URT)&#xD;
      microbiome in humans is limited. Furthermore, we have little understanding of how acute viral&#xD;
      respiratory infections of SARS-CoV-2 influence the URT microbiome, or how genotypic&#xD;
      differences in the virus influence the URT microbiome and vice versa. Innate immune responses&#xD;
      to pathogens, along with dysregulation of inflammation, are key factors involved in&#xD;
      pathogenesis, and different viral pathogens activate different types of inflammatory&#xD;
      responses. Respiratory viral infection i.e., SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to activate&#xD;
      TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 responses and this is likely to modulate commensal microbiota&#xD;
      populations. It is not yet known if the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease in older adults is due&#xD;
      to a biased host response, SARS-CoV-2 virulence determinants, or the impact infection has on&#xD;
      commensal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to this point, there is no unanimously approved treatment for the disease nor is there a&#xD;
      vaccine or antiviral drugs available for the public. The primary methods for treatment of&#xD;
      this deadly virus have been supportive in nature including intubation in severe cases with&#xD;
      respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a unanimous treatment has yet to be discovered, there has been a great amount of&#xD;
      knowledge garnered over the last few months about the virus and the disease that accompanies&#xD;
      it. Several studies have demonstrated high viral titers within the nasopharynx and oral&#xD;
      cavity and many have posited that this is the primary source of infection and viral&#xD;
      replication. Additionally, a high nasal/nasopharyngeal viral load has been associated with&#xD;
      increased symptoms and higher severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, there have been a number of studies recently looking at the effect of nasal&#xD;
      saline irrigations in the setting of viral URIs, including coronaviruses (not including&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2). One of the major takeaways from these studies was decreased viral shedding in&#xD;
      patients treated with saline irrigations compared to the control group. Nasal saline&#xD;
      irrigations are available over the counter and widely viewed as both safe and affordable.&#xD;
      Could these irrigations have a similar effect on the novel SARS-CoV-2 that they have on other&#xD;
      viral respiratory infections?&#xD;
