    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess efficacy and safety outcomes of a model of abortion care&#xD;
      implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involves telehealth for&#xD;
      counseling and information, to maintain social distancing, but requires participants to pick&#xD;
      up their medications in the clinic in keeping with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's)&#xD;
      Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements. The study will compare efficacy&#xD;
      of this model to usual in-clinic care based on published rates. It will also investigate&#xD;
      participant acceptability and feasibility of this model of care.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will complete an online medical screening form and watch videos about the study. Within 24 hours, the study clinician will conduct a face-to-face video-chat with the participant, review their medical history, and ensure they understand the study requirements, risks and benefits and provide additional information and counseling. The participant will then be directed to pick up their medication abortion pills from a study clinic. The participant will have 3 follow-up online check-ins or surveys: the first follow-up will be 3 days after the package is received, the second follow-up will be 7 days after the participant takes mifepristone, and third and final follow-up will be 4 weeks after the mifepristone.</intervention_model_description>
