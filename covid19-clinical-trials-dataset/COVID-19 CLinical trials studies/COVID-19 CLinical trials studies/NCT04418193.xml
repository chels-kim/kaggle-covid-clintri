  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no treatment has proven its effectiveness in the caring of patients infected with&#xD;
      type 2 Coronavirus. The Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace (CHPG) has decided to only propose&#xD;
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials to patients at the early and&#xD;
      symptomatic stages of the disease. Data from the literature show in vitro results on the&#xD;
      potential clinical benefit of some treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      (HXCQ). Observational data suggest a potential benefit of this treatment alone or in&#xD;
      combination with azithromycin (HXCQ + AZ). These data were advertised or led to a request&#xD;
      from ambulatory medicine and patients to have access to these treatments despite their poor&#xD;
      level of evidence. This leads to a decrease in the number of patients recruitable for&#xD;
      clinical trials because they refuse the concept of control arms or they wish active treatment&#xD;
      (CQ, HXCQ or HXCQ + AZ) from the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we propose to conduct in parallel with randomized trials, a so-called&#xD;
      &quot;patient preference&quot; protocol which, after patients information, gives them the choice,&#xD;
      either to participate in the trial or to choose between treatment with HXCQ, treatment with&#xD;
      HXCQ + AZ or standard of care without medication. The patients follow-up and the main&#xD;
      endpoint will be the same under the patient preference protocol as for the randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of this approach is to offer a common follow-up to all patients, to take into&#xD;
      account patients who refuse to participate in the clinical trial, to obtain external validity&#xD;
      data, to reduce selection bias and to increase the heterogeneity of patients exposed to&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected objective is to see if the patient preference protocol leads to observe the same&#xD;
      effects as in the randomized trial.&#xD;

      Conduct of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-selection / Recruitment It is proposed to participate in the study to patients who&#xD;
           cannot or do not wish to participate in a randomized therapeutic trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion procedure During the inclusion visit, if the patient meets the study selection&#xD;
           criteria, the investigator delivers oral and written information and responds to any&#xD;
           patient questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up of people suitable for research&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inclusion visit The treatment chosen by the patient is administered.&#xD;
                Socio-demographic, history, clinical and biological data are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Visit on day 3 ± 1 Hydroxychloroquinemia is dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Visit on day 5 ± 1 A nasopharyngeal swab sample is collected during the routine&#xD;
                visit. This sampling is only performed for patients for whom the diagnosis of&#xD;
                COVID-19 has been made by RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Visit on day 10 ± 1 A nasopharyngeal swab sample is collected during the routine&#xD;
                visit. This sampling is only performed for patients for whom the diagnosis of&#xD;
                COVID-19 has been made by RT-PCR. Hydroxychloroquinemia is dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Visit on day 14 A visit or a telephone call is made to gather the occurrence of&#xD;
                clinical events of interest on day 14. The treatments received during the last 14&#xD;
                days are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Visit on day 28 A visit or a telephone call is made to gather the occurrence of&#xD;
                clinical events of interest on day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments received during the last 14 days are collected.&#xD;
