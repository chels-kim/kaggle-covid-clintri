  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with a cytokine storm that leads to respiratory distress, multiorgan&#xD;
      failure and elevated mortality. Oral colchicine exhibits high anti-inflammatory capacity&#xD;
      attributed to the inhibition of microtubules polymerization, inflammasome and production of&#xD;
      IL-1β and IL-6, which could prevent the inflammatory storm in COVID-19 patients at risk. We&#xD;
      present a randomized clinical trial, controlled, open-label and pragmatic, including COVID-19&#xD;
      patients requiring hospitalization but no intensive care yet. Colchicine will be started&#xD;
      within the first 48 hours and then administered for four weeks using a descending dose. The&#xD;
      benefit will be study in terms of clinical evolution (WHO 7-point scale) and IL-6 levels, as&#xD;
      well as other clinical and biochemical secondary end-points. In the case of positive results,&#xD;
      the clinical impact would be relevant given that this oral medication is widely accessible&#xD;
      which would help to prevent the inflammatory complications associated with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, prospective, pragmatic, randomized, controlled and open-label trial,&#xD;
      comparing standard of care vs. standard of care plus COLCHICINE for four weeks, in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized due to COVID-19 and confirmed infection by SARSCov2, within the first 48 hours&#xD;
      after the hospital admission. Patients meeting severity criteria will be excluded, defined as&#xD;
      established limitation of therapeutic effort or need for invasive mechanical ventilation at&#xD;
      the time of inclusion. The colchicine treatment includes an initial dose of 1.5 mg (1 mg and&#xD;
      0.5 mg two hours after), followed by 0.5 mg every 12 hours during the next 7 days and 0.5 mg&#xD;
      every 24 hours until the completion of 28 days of total treatment. In patients receiving&#xD;
      ritonavir or lopinavir or with reduced renal clearance (&lt;50 ml/min/1.37m2), weight &lt;70 kg or&#xD;
      age &gt;75 years old, the dose will be adjusted to the half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion ones (see below), after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent, will be centrally randomized to &quot;colchicine&quot; or &quot;control&quot;&#xD;
      group. Patients in both groups will receive the standard therapy for COVID-19 according to&#xD;
      the stablished hospital protocols. Randomization will be controlled by: age, sex, time from&#xD;
      initiation of symptoms, cardiovascular disease, the 7 point WHO and levels of C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, ferritin, D-dimer, IL-6 and lymphocyte levels.&#xD;
