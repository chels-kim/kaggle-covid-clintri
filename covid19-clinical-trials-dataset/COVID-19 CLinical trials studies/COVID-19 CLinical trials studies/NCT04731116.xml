  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current management of COVID-19 (coronavirus) is mainly supportive, and respiratory failure&#xD;
      from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. Cytokines&#xD;
      and chemokines are thought to play an important role in immunity and immunopathology during&#xD;
      virus infections. Patients with severe COVID-19 have higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) compared to individuals with mild&#xD;
      disease or healthy controls, similar to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      (SARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychotropic ingredient of Cannabis sativa, possesses potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. These effects are mediated by T cell&#xD;
      attrition and by inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release (tumor necrosis factor-a,&#xD;
      Interferon gamma, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-17) and stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      production (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13). In a number of phase 2 trials involving more than&#xD;
      100 patients, our group was able to show the safety and efficacy of CBD in the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of graft-versus-host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, we will test the cytokine profile, safety and efficacy of CBD treatment&#xD;
      in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the impact of CBD on the cytokine profile in patients with severe and critical&#xD;
           COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the safety and efficacy of CBD treatment in patients with severe and critical&#xD;
           COVID-19 pulmonary Infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, prospective open label phase 1/2-study which will be conducted in a&#xD;
      Corona isolation ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabidiol 5% dissolved in olive oil, will be given orally or through a nasogastric tube at&#xD;
      a dose of 150 mg twice daily during 14 days or until discharge (the earliest). This dose is&#xD;
      based on safety data generated from more than 100 transplanted patients. Treatment duration&#xD;
      may be extended up to 28 days according to the physician discretion. In case of intolerance&#xD;
      to the dose of 150 mg twice daily, the dose of CBD will be reduced to the maximal tolerated&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of grade 4 side effects related to CBD or in the case of inability to provide the&#xD;
      CBD during more the 3 days, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
