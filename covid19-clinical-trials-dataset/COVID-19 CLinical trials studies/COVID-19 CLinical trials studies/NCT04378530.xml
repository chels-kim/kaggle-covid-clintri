  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to optimize the delivery of mHealth tools to support the&#xD;
      formation of persistent mindfulness meditation routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify the efficacy of the anchoring strategy on the persistence of daily meditation&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Persistence (measured through repeated observations of panel regression models of the&#xD;
      daily likelihood of mindfulness mediation over the 16-week follow-up period) will be greater&#xD;
      among AG as compared to CG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine participant phenotypes that are (a) associated with successfully anchoring&#xD;
      daily meditation or (b) likely to need additional supports. Potential moderators of the&#xD;
      anchoring strategy's success include participants' daily schedule, type of work, household&#xD;
      composition, motivation, time and risk preferences, and prior exposure to mindfulness, which&#xD;
      will be analyzed in the panel regression model framework above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the optimal type, timing, and sequence of push notifications for encouraging&#xD;
      daily mindfulness meditation within and across study groups. The efficacy of each push&#xD;
      notification type (tracking sessions completed, reminders, mood symptom tracking, and&#xD;
      group-specific goal reminders), timing, and dynamics on the anchoring of daily meditation&#xD;
      will inform a subsequent, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This study will inform an optimal JITAI R01 proposal that will personalize the type&#xD;
      and temporal dynamics of app-based daily supports for successfully routinizing daily&#xD;
      meditation, and determine its effects on mental health, specifically PTSD. Lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence of PTSD is 7% in adults and meditation is known to reduce PTSD. If effective&#xD;

      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited for a &quot;health and well-being&quot; study starting&#xD;
      July, 2020. Interested participants will be directed to a Qualtrics link to complete an&#xD;
      online eligibility screener. The screener will take approximately 3 minutes to complete (See&#xD;
      Eligibility Survey). The survey will be free, voluntary, and available online. Participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to skip questions in the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Once eligibility is determined, eligible participants will be sent an informed&#xD;
      consent. Ineligible participants will be sent an email notifying their status and why. Once&#xD;
      an informed consent is signed and received, the participant will be notified of their random&#xD;
      assignment and study start date. Participants will be randomized via an online randomizer&#xD;
      (i.e., randomizer.com) to either the Anchor Group (intervention) or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: The Research Team will email the participants instructions to download Calm (See&#xD;
      Participant Scripts). On their study start date the participant will be sent their baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires via a Qualtrics link. The measures will be online and should take&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes to complete (See Baseline Questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The study will run for 8-weeks. Intervention participants will receive access&#xD;
      to the mobile application Calm and be recommended to participate in the meditation features.&#xD;
      Each participant will receive push notifications related to, tracking sessions completed,&#xD;
      reminders, mood symptom tracking, and group-specific goal reminders. The intervention group&#xD;
      will be provided an anchoring strategy video on the persistence of daily meditation practice&#xD;
      and receive anchoring strategy specific push notification study reminders. The control group&#xD;
      will receive access to the mobile application Calm and be recommended to participate in the&#xD;
      meditation features but will not be asked to watch the anchoring strategy video. The control&#xD;
      group will also receive push notification reminders however, they will not be anchor strategy&#xD;
      specific (See Push Notifications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracking: Participation in the Calm meditations will be tracked (app feature used, time of&#xD;
      day used, and time spent in meditation) by the Calm informatics team. Additionally, they will&#xD;
      answer one, multiple-choice EMA (ecological momentary assessment) question each evening (see&#xD;
      Study Questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-study: Post-study questionnaires and the satisfaction survey will be emailed to&#xD;
      intervention and control participants via a link from Qualtrics (See Post-study&#xD;
      questionnaires). The post-intervention surveys will be online and take about 20 minutes and&#xD;
      the satisfaction survey will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Participants will receive a follow up survey to complete via Qualtrics at 16&#xD;
      weeks. Follow up questionnaires and the satisfaction survey will be emailed to intervention&#xD;
      and control participants via a link from Qualtrics. The follow up surveys will be online and&#xD;
      take about 20 minutes and the satisfaction survey will take about 5 minutes. The follow up&#xD;
      surveys will be identical to the post-study questionnaires.&#xD;
