      Part I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 subjects will receive an open-label 500 µl subcutaneous injection via needle and syringe&#xD;
      of the study IMP (CoVac-1). No more than one subject per day will be enrolled. 28 days&#xD;
      following vaccination of the 12th volunteer, there will be an interim analysis of safety and&#xD;
      a safety review by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) as well as an amendment to the&#xD;
      regulatory authorities (Paul-Ehrlich Institute and Ethics Committee) before proceeding to&#xD;
      Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 subjects will receive an open-label 500 µl subcutaneous injection via needle and syringe&#xD;
      of the study investigational medicinal product (IMP) (CoVac-1). 28 days following vaccination&#xD;
      of the 12th volunteer, there will be an interim analysis of safety and a safety review by the&#xD;
      DSMB whether to proceed to next Part III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 subjects will receive an open-label 500 µl subcutaneous injection via needle and syringe&#xD;
      of the study IMP (CoVac-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the clinical is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single use of a&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-derived multi-peptide vaccine in combination with the toll like receptor (TLR)1/2&#xD;
      ligand XS15 in adults&#xD;

      SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a peptide vaccine consisting of SARS-CoV-2 specific HLA class II peptides&#xD;
      in volunteers without prior or current SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification and characterization of T cell epitopes is a long-standing and&#xD;
      unparalleled expertise of the Department of Immunology. This unique approach is based on i)&#xD;
      the prediction of HLA binding sequences for HLA class I and class II alleles using the&#xD;
      world's first prediction tool (www.syfpeithi.de) and newer, more refined methods, all based&#xD;
      on SYFPEITHI (database for MHC ligands), ii) the identification of naturally presented HLA&#xD;
      class I and class II ligands, iii) the synthesis of synthetic peptides, and iv) the&#xD;
      characterization of T-cell epitopes and peptide-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)4+&#xD;
      and CD8+ T cell responses. This strategy has been successfully applied in recent years to&#xD;
      define and characterize T-cell epitopes derived from various viruses such as cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV),Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (ADV) and influenza as well as tumor-associated&#xD;
      antigens of various solid and hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this work, the results were translated into therapeutic vaccination and T cell&#xD;
      transfer studies in cancer patients (e.g. NCT02802943) and viral infections. This direct&#xD;
      translation is made possible by the Wirkstoffpeptidlabor (Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Stefan&#xD;
      Stevanović) of the Department of Immunology and the good manufacturing practice (GMP)&#xD;
      facility for individualized drugs at the University Hospital Tuebingen as well as our immune&#xD;
      monitoring platform equipped with state-of-the-art, validated T-cell assays and methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing experience and logistics can be directly used for the treatment and prevention&#xD;
      of COVID-19 disease. In preliminary work for this study, CD4+ T cell epitopes have already&#xD;
      been characterized in a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected donors validating their high&#xD;
      relevance in the natural course of COVID-19. The vaccination cocktail in the study will&#xD;
      consist of eight promiscuous HLA class II peptides from the different proteins of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus, predicted to bind to several HLA class II allotypes. Furthermore,&#xD;
      especially those peptides were selected that contain embedded HLA class I sequences in order&#xD;
      to induce CD4+ T cell responses and CD8+ T cell responses simultaneously. Furthermore,&#xD;
      especially for peptides derived from virus surface proteins, only sequences were selected&#xD;
      that do not represent antibody epitopes. This should prevent the formation of antibodies&#xD;
      against the vaccinated peptides, which could possibly have a deteriorative effect on&#xD;
      COVID-19. Immunogenicity was proven for all HLA class II peptides included in the peptide&#xD;
      cocktail in a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors as well as for single peptides&#xD;
      in a first vaccination of a healthy volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further prerequisite for successful peptide vaccination, besides selection of optimal&#xD;
      antigen targets, is the use of a suitable adjuvant, which is able to induce potent and&#xD;
      long-lasting immune responses. Among the most effective approaches tested in humans is the&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 VG, a&#xD;
      water-in-oil-emulsion, combined with the TLR9 ligand CpG.However, CpG is not available for&#xD;
      clinical trials, and a peptide/antigen vaccine emulsified in Montanide without any additional&#xD;
      adjuvant induces no or only weak immune responses. In the P-pVac-SARS-CoV-2 trial, the novel&#xD;
      TLR1/2 ligand XS15 emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 VG will be employed as adjuvant, applied&#xD;
      subcutaneously together with the peptide vaccine. XS15 is a water-soluble derivative of the&#xD;
      TLR1/2 ligand Pam3Cys and induced a strong CD8+ and Th1CD4+ T-cell response against free&#xD;
      short peptides in Montanide ISA 51 VG after a single s.c. injection in a healthy volunteer as&#xD;
      well as in cancer patients.Immune responses could be induced against viral peptides&#xD;
      (including SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides), neo-epitopes derived from cancer-specific mutations&#xD;
      as well as tumor-associated self-peptides. XS15 results in granuloma formation on the&#xD;
      vaccination site, where the vaccinated peptides persist for at least 7 weeks.&#xD;
      Peptide-specific T cells were detected at the granuloma site, however, with a lower frequency&#xD;
      than in peripheral blood, which rules out the risk of T cell sequestration, dysfunction or&#xD;
      deletion at the vaccination site due to the use of XS15 in Montanide ISA 51 VG. Strikingly,&#xD;
      the induced immune responses were found to persist for more than 1.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the planned study we could also show that this vaccination method is able to&#xD;
      induce potent SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses in a human volunteer.&#xD;
