      The treatment with pioglitazone added to the standard treatment of patients with DM2&#xD;
      hospitalized for COVID-19 may produce a decrease in the number of patients who progress to a&#xD;
      second phase of severe systemic inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the latest studies, the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection shows&#xD;
      two clinically different phases: The first phase of viral and clinical infection of viriasis&#xD;
      (fever, myalgia, etc.) affects all patients and it is resolved in asymptomatic patients or&#xD;
      with clinically moderate-mild affectations. However, towards the end of the first week of&#xD;
      illness, a not inconsiderable number of patients progress towards a second phase of rapid and&#xD;
      abrupt deterioration of their respiratory and cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More and more data indicate an important role of overactivated macrophages, interleukin 6&#xD;
      (IL6) and an excessive inflammatory response in the genesis of this second phase of&#xD;
      aggravation. Linking with this hypothesis, the adipose tissue densely infiltrated by&#xD;
      macrophages is the source of one third of the body's IL6, its production being even greater&#xD;
      in the fat of central disposition of male distribution. All of this could explain the worse&#xD;
      prognosis observed in men, obese and with type 2 diabetes (DM2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the possible effect of pioglitazone on the expression of ACE2, there is little&#xD;
      literature, and less evidence, about the response of this receptor to treatment with&#xD;
      pioglitazone, and what is more important, its effect on COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies have analyzed the expression of this receptor after administration of&#xD;
      pioglitazone in different murine models of liver and kidney disease. The conclusions of these&#xD;
      studies were that the administration of pioglitazone in rats with hepatic steatosis increased&#xD;
      the expression of ACE2. It is known that the increased expression of ACE2 facilitates the&#xD;
      entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, in animal models it has been seen that ACE2 protects&#xD;
      against the development of respiratory distress syndrome and that severe cases of COVID-19&#xD;
      and SARS 2003 have been linked to the possible inhibition of ACE2 by the virus and the&#xD;
      increase in angiotensin II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, it is a safe and proven drug in patients with DM2, cheap, with years of&#xD;
      clinical experience. The use of pioglitazone added to the conventional treatment of patients&#xD;
      at high risk, such as patients with COVID-19 and DM2, could be accompanied by a better&#xD;
      evolution of the patients, avoiding or mitigating the inflammatory process that already&#xD;
      occurs before its onset. seems to trigger the second accelerated phase of the disease.&#xD;
