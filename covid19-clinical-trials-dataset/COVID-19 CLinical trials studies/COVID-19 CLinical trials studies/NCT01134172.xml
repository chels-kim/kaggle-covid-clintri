  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how being treated for breast cancer affects&#xD;
      patients' employment, financial situation, and quality of life on a short-term basis and on a&#xD;
      long term basis. Most studies of employment after breast cancer have focused on Caucasian&#xD;
      women.This study will evaluate the impact of breast cancer on the lives of women from&#xD;
      different ethnic groups.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire at baseline, and then one at follow up, 3-4 months after treatment completion. The patient will be contacted one and two years after the completion of their follow up questionnaire for a brief one-question survey regarding current employment status. A member of the study team will call a subset of patients who have completed both baseline and follow-up surveys to clarify responses to previous questions. Patients will be considered lost to follow- up if surveys A or C have not been completed two years from the participant's consent date (participants who enroll but do not complete survey A are not prompted for survey C). Deviations will not be filed until the end of the study, as there are opportunities over the course of study follow- up to collect previously missing information.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire at baseline, and then one at follow up, 3-4 months after treatment completion. All three follow-up contact methods (email, postcard, call) contain the same question regarding current employment status with minor modifications in formatting. However, the employment question asked in all three follow-up contact methods is shown in the Postcard_Template document. Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic study staff will be working from home. Therefore, calls will be made via MSK-approved platforms (e.g. Jabber, etc.). Participants who express concerns or request assistance related to COVID-19 will be referred to publicly available resources as needed (e.g., call 311 for access to health care or food panties, etc.) and will be noted in internal tracking logs. The data collected for these internal tracking logs will be managed through a REDCap database.</description>

        We will recruit participants from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), four of&#xD;
        its community-based outpatient treatment centers, and four urban community hospitals and&#xD;
        clinics that serve large populations of ethnic minorities in New York City. The MSKCC&#xD;
        outpatient regional sites are located in New Jersey (Basking Ridge, Monmouth) and New York,&#xD;
        with two in Long Island (Commack and Rockville Centre) and another in Westchester County.&#xD;
