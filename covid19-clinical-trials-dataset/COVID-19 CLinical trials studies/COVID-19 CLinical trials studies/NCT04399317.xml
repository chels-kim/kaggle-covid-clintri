  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of a newly upcoming viral disease which is associated with COVID-19 puts the&#xD;
      whole world's health system under pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from this disease mainly develop respiratory symptoms, which can lead to&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating ICU, admission in 10-20% of&#xD;
      the cases admitted to hospital. In addition to these symptoms, patients show lymphopenia,&#xD;
      cardiac symptoms and altered coagulation profiles. Although those patients are treated in the&#xD;
      ICU the mortality is up to 20% due to multiorgan failure. The aim of this study is to show&#xD;
      non-inferiority of flow-controlled ventilation compared to standard (lung protective&#xD;
      ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission to the ICU, the patients will receive information about the study and&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken. Upon reaching the criteria for moderate to severe ARDS (P/F&#xD;
      ratio below 200 mmHg and PEEP above 5 cmH2O) the patients will be randomized. In the&#xD;
      treatment group (group A) the ultra-thin ventilation tube will be placed through the existing&#xD;
      tube. Then flow-controlled ventilation will be applied for 48 hours. In the other group&#xD;
      (group B) ventilation will be performed according to the lung protective strategy. All other&#xD;
      treatment will be unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data-collection will be started 1 hour after initiation of the study. Primary end point is&#xD;
      PaO2.&#xD;

      The pandemic of a newly upcoming viral disease which is associated with COVID-19 puts the&#xD;
      whole world's health system under pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from this disease mainly develop respiratory symptoms, which can lead to&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating ICU admission in 10-20% of&#xD;
      the cases admitted to hospital. In addition to these symptoms, patients show lymphopenia,&#xD;
      cardiac symptoms and altered coagulation profiles. Although those patients are treated in the&#xD;
      ICU the mortality there is up to 20% due to multiorgan failure. Currently, there is no proven&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy next to symptomatic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the severely ill patients will need intubation and invasive ventilation according to&#xD;
      ARDS treatment strategies including low tidal volumes and low end-expiratory pressures, not&#xD;
      all patients recover their pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow control ventilation (FCV) is a recently developed ventilation strategy which allows to&#xD;
      keep the intrapulmonary pressures low while achieving optimal gas exchange. It had been&#xD;
      proven in animal models to improve pulmonary function and oxygenation and in cases with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow Controlled Ventilation mode is a unique ventilation technique in which inspiration as&#xD;
      well as expiration are controlled i.e. actively performed. This is achieved by generating a&#xD;
      continuous flow into the patient's lungs during inspiration or a continuous (negative) flow,&#xD;
      sucking gasses out of the patient's lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous flow without ventilation pauses, results in linear increases and decreases in&#xD;
      intratracheal pressures. As a result, the mean airway pressure will be higher compared to&#xD;
      conventional large bore Volume Controlled Ventilation or Pressure Controlled Ventilation&#xD;
      (PCV). Therefore, the bronchiole and alveoli will be kept open during ventilation&#xD;
      facilitating oxygen uptake to the blood. Moreover, the continuous gas flow enhances gas&#xD;
      mixture in the lungs also improving gas exchange. Altogether, FCV results in more efficient&#xD;
      ventilation as compared to conventional ventilation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evone® is the only commercially available ventilator applying FCV ventilation mode, thus&#xD;
      directing the inspiration as well as the expiration. Evone's FCV® ventilation mode is based&#xD;
      on a controlled inspiration and expiration flow from a set PEEP to a set peak pressure and&#xD;
      vice versa. The inspiratory flow is continuously controlled by advanced mass flow regulators;&#xD;
      the expiratory flow is controlled by regulated suctioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study This study aims to demonstrate the positive effects on oxygenation of&#xD;
      flow-controlled ventilation compared to conventionally ventilated patients (pressure control&#xD;
      ventilation) in patients suffering from ARDS associated with COVID-19.&#xD;
