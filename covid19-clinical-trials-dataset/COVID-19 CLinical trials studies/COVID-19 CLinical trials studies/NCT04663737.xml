    <textblock>
      This single-center, open-label, 2 arm parallel-group, randomized, interventional prospective&#xD;
      exploratory study in 20 subjects aimed to evaluate safety and explore putative clinical&#xD;
      benefits of Silmitasertib 1000 mg BID dose in patients with moderate COVID-19. Two-arm trial&#xD;
      comparing the SOC/supportive care alone to the SOC/supportive care with addition of&#xD;
      Silmitasertib (allocation ratio 1:1).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Silmitasertib is a first-in-class small molecule drug that targets Casein Kinase 2 (CK2).&#xD;
      Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates key proteins required to trigger mechanisms vital for viral&#xD;
      replication and also is involved in development of host anti-viral immune response.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins interacting with many human host proteins affect multiple innate&#xD;
      immune pathways. One of these key proteins dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 is the protein kinase&#xD;
      CK2. SARS-COV-2 upregulates CK2 to support viral replication, avoid innate immune response&#xD;
      and spread virus to nearby cells. Overactivation of CK2 indirectly contribute to successful&#xD;
      viral replication and development of cytokine storm.SARs-Cov-2-induced overexpression of CK2,&#xD;
      while pharmacological inhibition of CK2 suppresses virus proliferation. CK2 signaling appears&#xD;
      to be an important pathway hijacked by SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging pre-clinical and clinical data and results of independent efficacy evaluation&#xD;
      conducted by Utah State University and UCSF COVID-19 research group and Senhwa Biosciences&#xD;
      hypothesize that Silmitasertib (CX-4945) could potentially quell virus-provoked aberrant&#xD;
      hyperactivation of the innate immune system by inhibition of upregulated CK2 protein kinase,&#xD;
      preferentially restoring normal host cell cytokine regulation, and attenuating viral&#xD;
      replication in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, thereby preventing disease&#xD;
      progression and improving clinical outcomes. Intended target patient population for treatment&#xD;
      with Silmitasertib (CX-4945) are SARS-COV-2 positive patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      COVID-19, since in the moderate to severe stage of the disease infected cells actively&#xD;
      produce viral proteins that dysregulate signaling pathways to allow viruses to manipulate&#xD;
      host immune responses to create an environment more favorable for infection, that may not be&#xD;
      observed in the initial or mild stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CX-4945 demonstrated remarkable clinical benefits under emergency IND authorization in a&#xD;
      patient with COVID-19 pneumonia not responsive to remdesivir, dexamethasone and antibiotics&#xD;
      and requiring supplemental oxygen. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      in five days of treatment with CX-4945.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this open-label, randomized, 2 arm parallel-group controlled, interventional&#xD;
      prospective exploratory study in 20 subjects is to evaluate safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Silmitasertib (CX-4945) 1000 mg BID dose, to compare time to clinical&#xD;
      recovery, and putative clinical benefit across treatment groups, and to evaluate anti-viral&#xD;
      activities in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silmitasertib is a generally well-tolerated medication. Most adverse events reported were&#xD;
      mild to moderate in severity. The most common toxicities associated with CX-4945 were&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders, manageable with drug discontinuation or use of anti-diarrheal&#xD;
      medication. Based on the currently available data, the identified or potential risks of the&#xD;
      product do not outweigh its identified or potential benefits.&#xD;
