  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that JAK 1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib, an FDA approved&#xD;
      treatment for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, could have a similar effect in&#xD;
      patients with severe COVID-19, quelling the immune-hyperactivation, allowing for clearance of&#xD;
      the virus and reversal of the disease manifestations.&#xD;
