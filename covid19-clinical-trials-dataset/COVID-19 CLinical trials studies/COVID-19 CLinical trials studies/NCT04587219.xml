    <textblock>
      An open-ended prospective non-randomized study involving volunteers over the age of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 110 volunteers. who will receive the test drug according to the&#xD;
      prime-boost scheme: the introduction of component 1 will be carried out on the 1st day, and&#xD;
      component 2 - on the 21st day of the study. Outpatient monitoring will be performed during 4&#xD;
      visits: on the 7th, 14th, 28th, and 42nd days after the vaccine administration Also two&#xD;
      visits will be performed in the phone contact mode for 90 and 180 days&#xD;
