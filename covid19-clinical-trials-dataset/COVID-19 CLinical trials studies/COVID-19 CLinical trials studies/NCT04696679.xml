  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, a new HCoV, SARS-Cov2, originating in China, has been spreading around the&#xD;
      world. As of 13 may 2020, almost 4.2 million cases of infections and 292 000 died were&#xD;
      reported worldwide (140 000 infection cases and 27 000 died in France). Human coronaviruses&#xD;
      (HCoV) usually cause common upper respiratory tract infections in children and sometimes&#xD;
      exacerbate lung and asthma diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the risk of contamination of SARS-Cov2 (Covid-19), the French government has put&#xD;
      in place directives that modified the daily lives of students, teachers and families. The&#xD;
      societal change imposed by the state of health emergency with a confinement and deconfinement&#xD;
      period could strongly impact the quality of life of very preterm children with dysexecutive&#xD;
      disorders. These children are a population vulnerable to changes, especially during the&#xD;
      pivotal period of elementary school. The executive dysfunctions disrupt children's learning&#xD;
      and schooling, as well as their social adaptation, compromising their personal development&#xD;
      and therefore, their quality of life.&#xD;
