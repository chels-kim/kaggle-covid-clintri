  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cases of chilblains have been reported with an unusual frequency in France in the context of&#xD;
      the COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Some of these cases have been&#xD;
      linked to a virological status in favour of a recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Chilblains are acral inflammatory lesion typically&#xD;
      reactive to cold (primary form). There are secondary forms acquired during autoimmune&#xD;
      connectivitis such as lupus chilblain or hereditary forms related to type I Interferonopathy.&#xD;
      An interferon type I signature has been described in these secondary forms of frostbite but&#xD;
      also during the cytokine storm of severe forms of CoV-2 SARS infection. If cases of frostbite&#xD;
      are indeed secondary to an SARS-CoV-2 infection, comparative analysis of their&#xD;
      immunopathological profiles could provide a better understanding of the inflammatory&#xD;
      mechanisms during COVID-19.&#xD;
