  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the tolerability of high dose hydroxychloroquine in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 who are not yet hospitalized, but have risk factors for disease progression and&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm and single-center tolerability study of high dose HCQ therapy in&#xD;
      outpatient adult participants with mild COVID-19. In vitro studies have shown antiviral&#xD;
      effects of HCQ against SARS Cov-2, but the clinical outcomes in the disease have been&#xD;
      variable. Our hypothesis is that targeting high risk patients earlier in the disease course&#xD;
      and with a higher dose regimen are both required to see improvement in disease outcome&#xD;
      measures in COVID-19. This study aims to prove the tolerability of high dose HCQ in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are selected based on the identification of risk factors associated with more severe&#xD;
      disease outcomes. Investigators will enroll twenty patients and perform a detailed&#xD;
      Tele-health interview to ensure they meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent.&#xD;
      1200 mg hydroxychloroquine daily will be prescribed, in divided doses.The subjects will be&#xD;
      required to monitor their temperatures twice daily and a daily telephone call with an&#xD;
      investigatory will review symptoms of disease and potential side effects of the drug.&#xD;
      Subjects can discontinue the medication after five days if they no longer have fever, or take&#xD;
      the medication for up to ten days if required for fever resolution.&#xD;
