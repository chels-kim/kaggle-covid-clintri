  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has developed worldwide in less than 4 months. The clinical presentations&#xD;
      are variable widely, ranging from simple rhinitis to major lung damage that can lead to&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries involved in the ongoing health disaster due to SARS-CoV-2 infection,&#xD;
      hospital are overloaded. In this context, the decision to hospitalize or to manage COVID-19&#xD;
      patients at home is crucial and defining reliable and consensual criteria is a major issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOME-CoV study is a multicentre quasi-experimental interventional study, before and after&#xD;
      implementation of a help-decision making rule (HOME-CoV rule), developed via the Delphi&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that a strategy based on the consensual HOME-CoV rule compared to&#xD;
      current practice is at least as safe as regards the 7-day-rate of adverse events (safety&#xD;
      criterion) and more effective as regards the rate of patients eventually managed as&#xD;
      outpatients (efficacy criterion).&#xD;

      Definition of HOME-CoV rule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Delphi method is used to reach a consensus of a large panel of experts and to define an&#xD;
      easy-to-use clinical rule aiming to help emergency physicians in hospitalisation or&#xD;
      outpatient management decision making : the HOME-CoV rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the rule implementation is evaluated in a before and after study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before period: observational assessment of current practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  implementation period : educational lectures, posters, and pocket cards showing and&#xD;
           explaining HOME-CoV rule are communicated to participating Emergency Departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after period : observational assessment of practices&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each period, patients consulting Emergency Departments with suspected or probable COVID-19&#xD;
      are evaluated for potential inclusion. Clinical, biological and imaging data that may be&#xD;
      involved in decision-making about hospitalization are collected as well as the physician&#xD;
      final decision (hospitalization or outpatient management) and its main determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone-call follow-up is performed and the clinical status according to the Ordinal Scale&#xD;
      for Clinical Improvement of COVID-19 from the World Heath Organization is collected on day 7&#xD;
      and day 28 following inclusion.&#xD;
