      19 COVID (Coronavirus disease 2019 ) is a deadly viral disease that has been spreading around&#xD;
      the world for several months, and is caused by a CORONA family virus (COVID-19). Following&#xD;
      IN-VITRO evidence of the antiviral effect of CHLOROQUINE in CORONA viruses, this drug has&#xD;
      been used empirically for COVID-19 patients and is currently recommended in Israel for the&#xD;
      treatment of intermediate and severity disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of chloroquine is in part by inhibiting the virus distribution, and&#xD;
      changing the intracellular acidity, the virus distribution site. The intracellular&#xD;
      chloroquine concentration is determined by a pump called PGP (permeability glycoprotein) that&#xD;
      removes the drug from the cell and is activated by the drug. In the treatment of malaria, the&#xD;
      benefit of low dosage of the drug has been shown to be effective due to the fact that the&#xD;
      intracellular concentration of the drug is probably higher, and therefore the logic to&#xD;
      examine this issue in COVID-19 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a low dose of Chloroquine will reduce the&#xD;
      duration of the viral shedding and prevent the disease from worsening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      19 COVID is a deadly viral disease that has been spreading around the world for several&#xD;
      months, and is caused by a CORONA family virus (COVID-19). This virus family causes upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract disease and sometimes severe and fatal lung disease, as in the past:&#xD;
      SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and -MERS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the outbreak of the pandemic there has been a constant search for effective drug&#xD;
      treatment for the disease. Following IN-VITRO evidence of the antiviral effect of CHLOROQUINE&#xD;
      in CORONA viruses, this drug has been used empirically for COVID-19 patients and is currently&#xD;
      recommended in Israel for the treatment of intermediate and severity disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is not common to treat patients with mild illness or asymptomatic carriers. In&#xD;
      these situations, isolation is recommended until upper respiratory tract surfaces no longer&#xD;
      show the presence of the virus, a period of approximately 20 days. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of chloroquine is in part by inhibiting the virus distribution, and&#xD;
      changing the intracellular acidity, the virus distribution site. The intracellular&#xD;
      chloroquine concentration is determined by a pump called PGP that removes the drug from the&#xD;
      cell and is activated by the drug. In the treatment of malaria, the benefit of low dosage of&#xD;
      the drug has been shown to be effective due to the fact that the intracellular concentration&#xD;
      of the drug is probably higher, and therefore the logic to examine this issue in COVID-19&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a low dose of Chloroquine will reduce the&#xD;
      duration of the viral shedding and prevent the disease from worsening. Reducing the duration&#xD;
      of viral shedding, shortens the time when there is a risk that the person will spread the&#xD;
      disease, and the time when the person is in isolation and cannot return to his normal life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in two stages, first in patients with mild-grade symptomatology&#xD;
      disease , and then, depending on the results of the first phase, Investigator's will consider&#xD;
      chloroquine therapy in asymptomatic patients (carriers only) to reduce the duration of viral&#xD;
      shedding and prevent the onset of symptomatic disease. (Chloroquine dosage at this stage will&#xD;
      be determined by the results of the first stage) In the first stage, patients will be&#xD;
      recruited at a slight level and will compare two doses of chloroquine (low and normal) with&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, Investigator's plan to examine asymptomatic carriers. Progress between&#xD;
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the experiment will be contingent upon receiving a renewed approval&#xD;
      from the Helsinki Committee, based on an interim report to be submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 patients will be recruited in a mild&#xD;
      condition, with no background disease or drug therapy that endangers them with the side&#xD;
      effects of chloroquine. will monitor patients' will be monitor for clinical status and&#xD;
      periodic PCR (polymerase chain reaction ) results from nasal and pharyngeal surfaces.&#xD;
