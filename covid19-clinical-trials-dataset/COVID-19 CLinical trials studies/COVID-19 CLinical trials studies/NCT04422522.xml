      On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus&#xD;
      was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,&#xD;
      China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence of a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in Fibromyalgia (FM&#xD;
      )(especially depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder), which are associated with&#xD;
      a worse clinical profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these challenging times of COVID-19, anxiety increased among the general population.&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia patients are more at risk of developing anxiety in these difficult times. This&#xD;
      might result in more frequent visits to the rheumatology clinics with an exacerbation of&#xD;
      their chronic pain syndrome.&#xD;

      The first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates was&#xD;
      announced on 29 January 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global outbreak a pandemic.&#xD;
      Many measures have been taken by the UAE government since the COVID-19 outbreak started&#xD;
      hitting the region. From Mid March, the UAE had advised all citizens to restrict themselves&#xD;
      to essential travel only and had implemented a curfew between 8 pm and 6 am every day&#xD;
      starting from the end of March. On April 5th, UAE imposed a two-week lockdown to contain the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic and announced there will be disinfection drives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many awareness campaigns were initiated by rheumatologists through different media channels&#xD;
      advising patients with rheumatic diseases to avoid clinics and hospitals unless they have an&#xD;
      emergency. Some healthcare facilities started telemedicine services including rheumatology&#xD;
      outpatient clinics. However, most of the clinics and hospitals have maintained open&#xD;
      rheumatology clinics aiming to manage emergency cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread and chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain and other frequent syndromes such as chronic fatigue sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, irritable bowel disease, depression, and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence of a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in FM (especially&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder), which are associated with a worse&#xD;
      clinical profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these challenging times of COVID-19, anxiety increased among the general population.&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia patients are more at risk of developing anxiety in these difficult times. This&#xD;
      might result in more frequent visits to the rheumatology clinics with an exacerbation of&#xD;
      their chronic pain syndrome.&#xD;
