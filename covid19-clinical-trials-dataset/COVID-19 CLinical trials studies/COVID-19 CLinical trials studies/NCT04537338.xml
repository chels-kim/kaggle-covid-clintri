    <textblock>
      Describe the immune response of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, including an assessment of&#xD;
      the types of antibodies elicited by the infection, specifc antibody titers for the different&#xD;
      isotypes, evolution of the antibody response over time, protective efficacy and immune&#xD;
      correlates of protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigate genetic determinants of Covid-19 and of the imune response to this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the study will investigate secondary infection rate and its determinants among&#xD;
      household contacts of Covid-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to describe the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus&#xD;
      among patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease in terms of antibody levels, differences in&#xD;
      response related to epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, duration of the antibody&#xD;
      response and protective efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular interest is the demonstration of seroconversion with neutralizing antibodies,&#xD;
      their duration during a follow-up of two years and their ability to prevent subsequent&#xD;
      infections and disease. If antibodies are demonstrated to protect against subsequent&#xD;
      infections and that protection is long-lasting, this can be instrumental for the&#xD;
      reincorporation of immune individuals into normal life and economic activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary objectives include determination of population-prevalence of past&#xD;
      infection and assessment of genetic determinants of the immune response and the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of the disease. Finally, we will investigate secondary transmission in a sample&#xD;
      of household contacts of Covid-19 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide important information to define the use of specific types of&#xD;
      antibodies and their potential utility for diagnosis, ascertainment of previous exposure and&#xD;
      acquired immunity. The effort is being conducted by the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social,&#xD;
      the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones&#xD;
      Biomédicas (ACIB), in collaboration with the US National Cancer Institute, the US National&#xD;
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the German Cancer Research Center and will&#xD;
      be supervised by the Ethical Committee of the CCSS according to local regulations.&#xD;

        This observational study will involve the recruitment of a large series of cases from Costa&#xD;
        Rica,including both patients who already recovered from the disease and newly diagnosed&#xD;
        cases, regardless of the severity of the clinical presentation.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Potential participants will be excluded or deferred from enrollment if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are in critical clinical condition precluding enrollment at the discretion of the&#xD;
             treating clinicians (deferral)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The clinician determining eligibility in agreement with the principal investigator&#xD;
             considers that there is a reason that precludes participation;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Enrollment of active cases Most of the cases of Covid-19 are treated at CCSS hospitals or&#xD;
        clnics, where the it is a disease of mandatory reporting. Personnel of the Social Security&#xD;
        or Ministry of Health will inform the potential participant case about the study and ask if&#xD;
        they are willing to be contacted by study personnel to receive further information. The&#xD;
        intention is to recruit all cases with the disease registered in Costa Rica.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrollment of recovered cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recovered cases are subjects previously diagnosed with Covid-19 via a positive PCR test who&#xD;
        were considered recovered because they had two consecutive negative PCR tests. The first&#xD;
        cases was diagnosed in March 2020. They will be contacted and recruited at home based on&#xD;
        the registration lists of the CCSS and the Ministry of Health, their eligibility criteria&#xD;
        and consent procedures will be similar to those of the active cases, but their specimen&#xD;
        collection will be different Community control group selection and enrollment Inclusion&#xD;
