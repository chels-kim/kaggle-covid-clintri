    <textblock>
      COVID 19 pandemic is a serious challenge for International medical community. There is lack&#xD;
      of knowledge about the nature and character of the lung injury caused by this kind of&#xD;
      infection. At the beginning COVID-associated lung injury was considered as typical ARDS,&#xD;
      hence respiratory and nonrespiratory treatments were delivered according to general&#xD;
      principles for this kind of illness. There is hypothesis that in predisposed individuals,&#xD;
      alveolar viral damage is followed by an inflammatory reaction and by microvascular pulmonary&#xD;
      thrombosis. This progressive endothelial thromboinflammatory syndrome may also involve the&#xD;
      microvascular bed of the brain and other vital organs, leading to multiple organ failure and&#xD;
      death. Understanding the crucial role of microthrombosis in the genesis of SARS-2-CoV led to&#xD;
      a widespread anticoagulant use. Moreover, there is evidence about a possible benefit of&#xD;
      thrombolysis in patients with severe COVID-19 pulmonary disease. For Instance, some&#xD;
      investigators reported about three patients with COVID 19 lung injury treated with alteplase&#xD;
      (tPA). Authors oversaw positive changes in P/F ratio in 3/3 patients, even if in two of these&#xD;
      patients changes lasted for a short period. Another investigators reported about the&#xD;
      improvements in alveolar ventilation, arterial oxygenation and diminishing in vasopressor's&#xD;
      support in 4 patients with SARS-2CoV after thrombolysis. Encouraging results were obtained&#xD;
      also by another team in case series of 5 patients who received alteplase. Thus, there is&#xD;
      evidence suggesting that thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial when compared to standard&#xD;
      care in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and severe respiratory failure. This hypothesis is based on&#xD;
      a well-established pathophysiological concept of the occurrence of pulmonary damage as a&#xD;
      result of microthrombosis of the lung vessels. Hence, it seems crucial to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish whether plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment improves alveolar&#xD;
      ventilation P/F (PaO2/FiO2) ratio will be calculated each 6 hours during first 3 days after&#xD;
      the end of thrombolysis procedure in patients with an Atypical Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (Microvascular COVID-19 Lung Vessels Obstructive Thromboinflammatory Syndrome&#xD;
      (MicroCLOTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Research assistants and/or clinician screen all mechanically ventilated patients for&#xD;
      eligibility. Patients satisfying all of the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria are classified&#xD;
      as 'Eligible'. With informed consent from a substitute decision maker or under the decision&#xD;
      of Concilium of three independent physicians, Eligible patients are 'Enrolled' into the&#xD;
      study. Eligible patients Qualify for Randomization to one of the 2 groups: with or without&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy. In summary, patients are consented and Enrolled prior to Randomization.&#xD;
      To enroll or randomize Eligible patients, research coordinators obtain informed consent and&#xD;
      access the automated web-based system through Internet based program (available 24&#xD;
      hours/day). Each participating center has a separate computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      schedule, with 1:1 (control to intervention) assignment, stratified by center, and using&#xD;
      random variable block sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thrombolysis procedure: In the study group, tPA (Alteplase) 25 mg i/v over 2 hours,&#xD;
      followed by a 25 mg tPA infusion over the subsequent 22 hours. After the end of thrombolytic&#xD;
      therapy, unfractionated heparin is administered i/v at a starting dose of 10 units / kg per&#xD;
      hour. The target value of PTT is 40C-50C. In the control group, an equivalent amount of&#xD;
      Ringer's solution is administered. After 24 hours, the heparin infusion gets started, similar&#xD;
      the described for study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups patient's transfer from the heparin infusion to the introduction of&#xD;
      low-molecular-weight heparins is performed after normalization of the D-dimer level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Primary data analysis will be based on intention to treat (ITT)&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed also on a modified ITT approach (mITT). Will be included in this&#xD;
      analysis only patients with evidence of an Atypical Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (Microvascular COVID-19 Lung Vessels Obstructive Thromboinflammatory Syndrome (MicroCLOTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroups analysis: Some pre-defined subgroups analysis will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with with P/F &lt;200 mmHg&gt;100 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with with P/F &lt;100 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient 65+ group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients under 65 years old. Interim analyses: Interim analyses will not be performed&#xD;
