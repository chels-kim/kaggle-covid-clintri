  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of March 18, 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in approximately 195 countries. No&#xD;
      specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are available. Several therapies, such&#xD;
      as remdesivir and favipiravir, are under investigation, but the antiviral efficacy of these&#xD;
      drugs is not yet known. The use of convalescent plasma (CP) was recommended as an empirical&#xD;
      treatment during outbreaks of Ebola virus in 2014. A protocol for treatment of Middle East&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with CP was established in 2015. This approach&#xD;
      with other viral infections such as SARS-CoV, H5N1 avian influenza, and H1N1 influenza also&#xD;
      suggested that transfusion of CP was effective. In previous reports, most of the patients&#xD;
      received the CP by single transfusion. In a study involving patients with pandemic influenza&#xD;
      A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection, treatment of severe infection with CP (n = 20 patients) was&#xD;
      associated with reduced respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response, and mortality.&#xD;
      In another study involving 80 patients with SARS, the administration of CP was associated&#xD;
      with a higher rate of hospital discharge at day 22 from symptom onset compared with patients&#xD;
      who did not receive CP. Accordingly, these findings raise the hypothesis that use of CP&#xD;
      transfusion could be beneficial in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to describe the initial clinical experience with CP transfusion administered to&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint of this trial would be to assess the&#xD;
      tolerability, efficacy, and dose-response of CP in severe COVID-19 patients. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint would be to assess the clinical and laboratory parameters after therapy, in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, length of hospital stay, reduction in the proportion of deaths, length of ICU&#xD;
      stay, requirement of ventilator and duration of ventilator support. All RT-PCR positive cases&#xD;
      with features of severe infection will be enrolled in this study. Apheretic CP will be&#xD;
      collected from a recovered patient (consecutive two RT-PCR samples negative) between day 22&#xD;
      to 35 days of recovery and those with the antibody titre above 1:320.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will consist of three arms, a. standard care, b. standard care and 200 ml CP and c.&#xD;
      standard care and 400 ml CP as a single transfusion. Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      for each arm. Randomization will be done by someone not associated with the care or&#xD;
      assessment of the patients by means of a random number table. Allocations will be concealed&#xD;
      in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Clinical parameters [fever, cough,&#xD;
      dyspnea, respiratory rate, PaO2/ FiO2 level, pulse, BP, the requirement of O2, and others]&#xD;
      will be recorded before and after CP. Laboratory parameters such as complete blood count,&#xD;
      CRP, chest X-ray, SGPT, SGOT, S. Ferritin, and serum antibody titre will be measured before&#xD;
      and after transfusion. Allergic or serum sickness-like reactions will be noted and adjusted&#xD;
      with outcome. Laboratory tests including RT-PCR will be done at BSMMU virology and laboratory&#xD;
      medicine department. Apheretic plasma will be collected at the transfusion medicine&#xD;
      department of SHNIBPS hospital, ELISA, antibody titre will be done at CMBT, and patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled at DMC and MuMCH. All necessary screening tests will be done before transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graphpad Prism v 7.0 will be used for analysis. One way ANOVA test, a non-parametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test, and a Kruskal-Wallis test will be performed to compare the arms. For&#xD;
      parametric outcomes, the investigators will compare the odds ratios across the pairs.&#xD;

      Rationale of the Study Currently no specific treatment is available against COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Supportive treatment along with concentrated oxygen is the only mean of treatment.&#xD;
      Researchers have already opened over 180 clinical trials of potential COVID-19 treatments for&#xD;
      recruitment, and nearly 150 could start soon. However, to date, no clinical intervention&#xD;
      trial has been completed and reported. Based on anecdotes (small case series), some of the&#xD;
      promising drugs could be azithromycin - hydroxychloroquine combination, Lopinavir/ Ritonavir,&#xD;
      Tocilizumab, Ramdisivir, Favirinapir, and others. CP transfusion is another promising option,&#xD;
      which had been tried before in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Flu and Ebola viral infection. Its&#xD;
      effectiveness against COVID-19 yet not explored. A recently published case series consists of&#xD;
      ten cases that forecast promising results. Therefore, a phase II RCT to explore the&#xD;
      tolerability, efficacy, and dose-response needs to explore urgently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cases started to escalate in Bangladesh and the number of confirmed cases already crossed&#xD;
      a thousand marks. Considering the cost and shortage of other above mentioned anti-viral and&#xD;
      biologics, it is inevitable that many of our patients possibly could not afford or get it.&#xD;
      However, the CP can be easily collected from the recovered patients and can easily be&#xD;
      processed to use it against active infection. This could be an effective and cheap treatment&#xD;
      option for a country like ours to face this catastrophe. Therefore conducting a phase II RCT&#xD;
      on CP transfusion is the demand of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does CP transfusion is tolerable and effective in treating severe COVID-19 patients compared&#xD;
      to standard treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the tolerability, efficacy, and dose-response of CP transfusion in severe COVID-19&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the appropriate effective dose of CP therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the efficacy of the therapy with their endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the clinical improvement after CP transfusion in severe COVID-19 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the laboratory improvement after CP transfusion in severe COVID-19 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Sheikh Hasina Burn &amp; Plastic Surgery&#xD;
      Institute, Dhaka Medical College, Mugda Medical College and Centre for Medical Biotechnology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      May 2020 - October 2020 (Six months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID=19 positive patients who are diagnosed on the basis of RT-PCR at BSMMU fever clinic or&#xD;
      by any other government-designated laboratory and admitted at DMCH, MuMC, and BSMMU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by someone not associated with the care or assessment of the&#xD;
      patients by means of a random number table. Allocations will be concealed in sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. In this pilot study, the CP or standard care will not be&#xD;
      blinded. However, the primary outcome (oxygen saturations, PaO2/FiO2, and BP) will be&#xD;
      recorded using an objective automated method; the study staff will not be able to influence&#xD;
      the recording of these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No similar study has been performed previously. Therefore no data are available that could be&#xD;
      used to generate a sample size calculation. This pilot study is required to provide some&#xD;
      initial data on efficacy and safety that will allow the design of a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Procedure of collection of Apheretic plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-donation screening: First of all, 3 ml blood will be drawn from peripheral venous&#xD;
           site preferably from dorsum of the hand, and will be kept in EDTA tube for further&#xD;
           testing. Blood group will be confirmed by using known antisera. Screening test of 5&#xD;
           diseases (HBs Ag , Anti HCV, HIV, Syphilis, and Malaria) will be tested by the device&#xD;
           method. An automated analyzer will count complete blood count. If all things remain&#xD;
           favorable, the next step will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety assessment: Body weight and height of the donor will be measured by a&#xD;
           conventional method (standard digital weight and height scale). For preventing citrate&#xD;
           toxicity or hypocalcaemic complications (twitching, numbness, nausea, mild respiratory&#xD;
           difficulty, etc) 500 mg calcium carbonate will be given to every donor before starting&#xD;
           the procedure. Blood pressure and pulse will be monitored in every 10-minute interval&#xD;
           for precaution throughout the procedure. Weight, height, and CBC parameter will be given&#xD;
           in apheresis machine for setting up. Visible and easily palpable anti cubital vein will&#xD;
           be selected for venepuncture. Before puncturing the vein, at least 50-60 mm of Hg&#xD;
           pressure will be given above the venepuncture area for maintaining sustained pressure.&#xD;
           When everything is ready, the procedure will be started by puncturing a single needle in&#xD;
           a targeted vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps of Convalescent Plasma (CP) transfusion Before giving CP to the patient blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse, temperature, the respiratory rate will be recorded. It can be given through the&#xD;
      central venous catheter or by peripheral channel. If peripheral venous site chosen then at&#xD;
      least 21g needle should be confirmed. Blood group and cross-matching should be confirmed&#xD;
      before starting the transfusion. When there is no chance of clerical mistake then CP&#xD;
      transfusion can be started at the rate of 100 ml/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient was suffering from fever then a temperature chart should be maintained. When the&#xD;
      temperature will be raised above 2 degrees Fahrenheit from the baseline then transfusion&#xD;
      should be stopped and antipyretic should be given according to the body weight. After a pause&#xD;
      of 10 minutes, transfusion can be started. If patient, feels excessive itching specific area&#xD;
      or whole over the body then Injection Chlorpheniramine maleate will be given. The steroid&#xD;
      would be preserved for managing severe respiratory distress or uncontrollable itching. Blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse, and respiratory will be monitored every 30 minutes interval regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure of measuring antibody titre&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer will be tested by ELISA according to the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At first the serum/plasma samples (10μL) were diluted to 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, and&#xD;
           1:640 by serial dilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 100μl of sample diluents will be added into each well (except blank and control well)&#xD;
           which are pre-coated with SARS-CoV-2 antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Then 10μl of specimen will be added. 100μl controls will be added to the assigned well&#xD;
           directly. All samples will be run in duplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The plate will be covered with the plate cover and will be incubated for 30 minutes at&#xD;
           37°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the end of the incubation, each well will be washed 5 times with diluted Wash Buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 100μl of conjugate will be added into each well except the Blank.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Incubation for 20 minutes at 37°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At the end of the incubation, each well will be washed 5 times with diluted Wash Buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 50μl of Substrate Solution A and 50μl of Substrate Solution B will be added into each&#xD;
           well. Incubation for 10 minutes at 37°C avoiding light.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. 50μl of Stop Solution will be added into each well.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The plate reader will be calibrated with the Blank well and the absorbance will be read&#xD;
           at 450nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The sample OD value was ≥cutoff OD value will indicate IgG antibody positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The IgG antibody titre will be determined by endpoint dilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of COVID-19 plasmid in Bangladesh and global shortage, 2 ml seum will be&#xD;
      preserves from each donor and later shipped to peter Medawar building for pathogen research,&#xD;
      University of Oxford. Research collaborators in Oxford will conduct the neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titre and the investigators will later match them with each donor. The expenses for&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody titre test will be managed by the Oxford colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graphpad Prism v 7.0 will be used for analysis. Demographic factors and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics will be summarized with counts (%) for categorical variables and median&#xD;
      (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous variables, as none was expected to be normally&#xD;
      distributed. The main analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. For the&#xD;
      primary outcome, the investigators will compare the mean between three arms using a one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA test. The investigators will also do posthoc analysis in Prism assessing (log-rank&#xD;
      Mantel-Cox test) time to sustained saturations &gt;93% and PaO2/FiO2&lt;200 mm of Hg censored&#xD;
      during enrolment, 3 days and 7 days after enrolment in a single time point. For&#xD;
      non-parametric secondary outcomes, all groups will be compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test;&#xD;
      if significant, the investigators then planned to perform pairwise comparisons with a&#xD;
      non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. For parametric outcomes, the investigators compared the&#xD;
      odds ratios across the pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities and procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RT-PCR and other study-related testing will be done at BSMMU. BSMMU fever clinic already&#xD;
      treated more than 1200 COVID-19 positive cases. Potential donors will be tracked from this&#xD;
      patient pool. Donors who will agree and give consent will be then sent to the Transfusion&#xD;
      medicine department of SHBPSI. 5 ml plasma will be collected and sent to the CMBT laboratory&#xD;
      for ELISA based antibody titre. If the titre fulfills the desired level (1:320 and above),&#xD;
      then 200 ml or 400 ml apheretic plasma (depending on availability and consent of the donor)&#xD;
      will be collected on the next day. 5 ml serum will be also be collected for sending into the&#xD;
      Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Oxford University for checking the neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody titre. This will be sent later and matched with the donor. The samples will be&#xD;
      shipped under the coverage of the materials transfer agreement (MTA). Dr. Fazle Rabbi&#xD;
      Chowdhury, the Co-PI of this project have the necessary permission for shipping samples&#xD;
      overseas. In the final stage, the CP will be handover to the clinical team at DMCH and MuMCH&#xD;
      as per their demand for transfusion. The clinical team will ensure the laboratory sample&#xD;
      collection before and after CP transfusion and will record the data in the case record form.&#xD;
      A laboratory medicine team of BSMMU will support the clinical team for lab testing.&#xD;
