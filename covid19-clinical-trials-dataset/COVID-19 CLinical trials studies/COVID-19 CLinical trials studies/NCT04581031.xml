  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess whether artificial intelligence (AI) combined with continuous&#xD;
      vital signs monitoring from wearable sensors can predict clinically relevant outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 infection on general medical wards.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients on general medical wards with COVID-19 infection considered to be at high risk&#xD;
      of deterioration will be asked to wear vital signs sensors for the duration of their hospital&#xD;
      stay. These sensors are an established method of recording patient vital signs and are CE&#xD;
      marked. Patients enrolled in the study will continue to receive routine medical care as&#xD;
      directed by their treating team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data recorded from the wearable sensors in this study will be analysed in conjunction&#xD;
      with routine data collected during the patient's treatment. Several models will be created&#xD;
      using deep learning AI techniques with the aim of reliably predicting several important&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. The study will identify whether continuous monitoring alone can improve&#xD;
      identification of deteriorating patients compared to traditional vital signs and if the&#xD;
      addition of AI technology / algorithms can provide even earlier identification.&#xD;
