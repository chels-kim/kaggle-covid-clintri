  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, identifying low-risk patients who can be safely treated&#xD;
      at home and high-risk patients requiring hospitalization or even intensive care is crucial&#xD;
      for Emergency Departments. Thanks to a consensus of experts using the Delphi method, we&#xD;
      previously defined the HOME-CoV rule. The HOME-CoV rule consists of 8 items precluding home&#xD;
      treatment for patients consulting in the Emergency Department (ED) with confirmed or highly&#xD;
      suspected mild to moderate COVID-19. It has been validated in a prospective study, patients&#xD;
      with a negative rule having a very-low rate of invasive ventilation or death within the 7&#xD;
      days following ED presentation (HOME-CoV study, NCT: 02811237).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using logistic regression, we revised the HOME-CoV rule in order to define a score allowing.&#xD;
      The revised HOME-CoV score comprises 7 criteria and, retrospectively assessed in the database&#xD;
      of the HOME-CoV study, it exhibits promising performances. A revised HOME-CoV score &lt; 2 had a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 0.93 (0.84 to 0.98), a specificity of 0.60 (0.58 to 0.61) and negative&#xD;
      predictive value of 1.00 (0.99 to 1.00); and a score &gt; 4 had a sensitivity of 0.41 (0.28 to&#xD;
      0.54), a specificity of 0.93 (0.92 to 0.94) and a positive predictive value of 0.11 (0.07 to&#xD;
      0.16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to prospectively validate the revised HOME-CoV score, firstly, in&#xD;
      identifying a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with a low risk of evolution to severe COVID-19&#xD;
      and who could be safely treated at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we will perform an interventional multicentric prospective pragmatic cohort&#xD;
      study with implementation of the revised HOME-CoV score to triage COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In all participating Emergency Departments, patients with highly suspected or confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 are evaluated for potential inclusion. Clinical, biological, and imaging data that&#xD;
      may be involved in decision-making about hospitalization, including all criteria of the&#xD;
      revised HOME-CoV score, are collected. The revised HOME-CoV score is calculated. Patients&#xD;
      with a score &lt;2 qualify for home treatment. They qualify otherwise for hospitalization. For&#xD;
      patients with a score &gt; 4, hospitalization in a unit allowing monitoring of vital parameters&#xD;
      is recommended. The qualification for home treatment or for hospitalization can be overruled&#xD;
      by the physician-in-charge in case of major medical or social reasons. A justification&#xD;
      explaining the cause of overruling is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone-call follow-up is performed on Day 7 and the patients' clinical status according to&#xD;
      the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of COVID-19 from the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO-OSCI) is collected.&#xD;
