  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multicenter, multinational, prospective single arm blinded study to&#xD;
      validate DXT's performance to identify patients at increased risk of weaning failure during&#xD;
      the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Continuous diaphragmatic excursion measurements by DXT&#xD;
      will be conducted during the patients' first SBT. The recording shall be initiated 15 minutes&#xD;
      prior to the first SBT and will end 15 minutes post SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on mechanical ventilation in the ICU meeting the eligibility criteria shall&#xD;
      undergo a daily screen for weaning readiness. If any of the components of the daily screen is&#xD;
      not met, the patient will not undergo a SBT that day and continued to be screened daily.&#xD;
      Patients passing daily screening criteria shall automatically receive an SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SBT shall last for 30-120 minutes and be performed on continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      up to 5 cm H2O and pressure support up to 7 cm H2O. The SBT shall be terminated and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation reinstituted at the original settings if the patient meets any of the&#xD;
      SBT failure criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial is considered successful and physicians will be asked to approve extubation when the&#xD;
      patient can breathe spontaneously for the whole trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients shall be continued to be screened daily until extubation, 21 days after enrolment,&#xD;
      performance of tracheostomy, death, or withdrawal of care. All patients shall be followed&#xD;
      until hospital discharge or death.&#xD;
