      The first-in-human Phase 1 study component will evaluate two dose levels of RAPA-501-ALLO off&#xD;
      the shelf cells in patients with post-intubation, stage 3 COVID-19 disease, with key&#xD;
      endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. The randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501&#xD;
      ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether&#xD;
      RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As&#xD;
      of January 11th, 2021, an estimated 90.4 million people have contracted the virus and&#xD;
      1,938,000 deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an&#xD;
      estimated 22.4 million people diagnosed and 375,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19,&#xD;
      viral propagation within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus&#xD;
      on immune molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications&#xD;
      (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is&#xD;
      driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation)&#xD;
      caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such,&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as&#xD;
      anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such&#xD;
      interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes&#xD;
      hyperinflammation due to &quot;cytokine storm&quot; and &quot;chemokine storm,&quot; tissue damage,&#xD;
      hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The&#xD;
      pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),&#xD;
      which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including&#xD;
      pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can&#xD;
      deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as&#xD;
      RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU&#xD;
      utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and&#xD;
      multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6&#xD;
      therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly&#xD;
      tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3&#xD;
      COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current&#xD;
      RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action&#xD;
      that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the&#xD;
      forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft&#xD;
      rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places&#xD;
      TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of&#xD;
      tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers&#xD;
      this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are&#xD;
      then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are&#xD;
      &quot;reprogrammed&quot; ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell&#xD;
      de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a &quot;hybrid&quot; product. The hybrid phenotype&#xD;
      inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple&#xD;
      cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of&#xD;
      multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates&#xD;
      Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune&#xD;
      modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell&#xD;
      therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a&#xD;
      protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action&#xD;
      that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T&#xD;
      cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of post-intubation, Stage 3&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

      RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of fatal pneumonia in experimental murine coronavirus infection is mediated by&#xD;
      innate inflammasome activation, a resultant robust infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages, and a subsequent increase in multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.&#xD;
      Importantly, the CD4+ and CD8+ adaptive T cell response to experimental coronavirus infection&#xD;
      can be either curative or disease propagating. Viral-induced pulmonary inflammation has also&#xD;
      been evaluated in non-human primate models, which have confirmed that dysregulated immune&#xD;
      activation during viral pneumonia involves T cell subset imbalance, a downstream&#xD;
      monocyte-derived inflammatory cascade, and resultant epithelial cell injury. In humans,&#xD;
      severity of viral-induced lower respiratory tract infection correlates with increased numbers&#xD;
      of effector memory CD8+ T cells in the airway. As recently reviewed, human coronavirus&#xD;
      infection represents an ongoing battle between virus and host, with the nature of the&#xD;
      response dictating disease cure or alternatively, aggravated lung disease. Evidence exists&#xD;
      that the adaptive immune system contributes to pulmonary inflammation during SARS-associated&#xD;
      Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease: that is, bronchoalveolar fluid from such subjects had&#xD;
      increased T cell numbers and increased Th1-associated molecules IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IP-10.&#xD;
      This downstream adaptive T cell-mediated inflammatory response is driven in part by the&#xD;
      SARS-Co-V protein viroporin 3a. Specifically, viroporin molecules activate the NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome that links innate-to-adaptive inflammatory responses. Furthermore, both SARS-CoV&#xD;
      and SARS-CoV-2 express an open-reading-frame ORF3a molecule, which also activate the NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of immunity during resolution of symptomatic COVID-19 infection has recently been&#xD;
      reported, namely: emergence of antibody-secreting cells and CD4+ T follicular helper cells;&#xD;
      increase in perforin- and granzyme-expressing CD8+ T cells; and relative lack of an increase&#xD;
      in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In marked contrast, patients with severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease had greatly increased plasma levels of cytokines (including IL-2 and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha) and chemokines (including IP-10 and MIP-1-alpha) (Huang et al., Lancet, 2020).&#xD;
      Collectively, these results indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses&#xD;
      that occur in severe COVID-19 is detrimental and that effective anti-inflammatory approaches&#xD;
      may ultimately prove to be therapeutic. However, as previously detailed, the more advanced&#xD;
      Stage 3 COVID-19 disease is characterized by an ARDS component, and cytokine storm, as such,&#xD;
      novel approaches to treat the COVID-19 viral pneumonia should optimally incorporate both an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory element and a tissue protection/tissue repair element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU&#xD;
      utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and&#xD;
      multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6&#xD;
      therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly&#xD;

      cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of post-intubation, Stage 3&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, classical autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and viral-induced&#xD;
      inflammatory disease are driven by predominance of Th1/Th17-type responses with a relative&#xD;
      insufficiency of the counter-regulatory immune suppressive Th2 and TREG subsets. TREG cells,&#xD;
      which are defined in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor, have been&#xD;
      extensively studied in experimental models for their capacity to modulate autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease, and transplantation complications, including graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. Importantly, T cell production of IL-2 or exogenous IL-2&#xD;
      administration drives lung inflammation during experimental viral infection; therefore, given&#xD;
      the known role of TREG cells as a consumer of IL-2, there is a strong mechanistic rationale&#xD;
      for a beneficial contribution of TREG cells during viral-driven lung inflammation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in an experimental murine models of virus-induced lung inflammation and lung&#xD;
      injury, interventions that augmented TREG cell number and function accelerated the repair of&#xD;
      lung injury. And, Th2 cells, which are defined in part by their expression of GATA3&#xD;
      transcription factor, were described thirty years ago as a powerful counter-regulatory&#xD;
      population to prevent Th1 cell predominance. It is important to note that clinical data&#xD;
      indicates that maneuvers that increase immune suppressive cell populations, including TREG&#xD;
      cells, can reduce severe inflammatory disease such as graft-versus-host disease without&#xD;
      impairing anti-viral immunity. In addition, in both experimental models and clinical studies,&#xD;
      an appropriate level of TREG cells can result in an overall improvement in pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation during viral bronchiolitis. Collectively, these findings indicate that T cells&#xD;
      expressing a combined TREG/Th2 phenotype would predictably yield beneficial effects in the&#xD;
      setting of viral-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury associated with severe Stage 3&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials have evaluated both TREG and Th2-type cells for various conditions, most&#xD;
      prominently transplantation complications. In general, thymic-derived natural (n)TREG cells&#xD;
      are thought to express a more stable phenotype than post-thymic induced (i)TREG cells; by&#xD;
      comparison, iTREG cells can mediate more potent suppression. Nonetheless, both nTREG and&#xD;
      iTREG cells are susceptible to differentiation plasticity, which creates concern that a&#xD;
      potentially therapeutic TREG population might convert to pathogenic Th1/Th17 phenotypes in&#xD;
      vivo. Ex vivo expanded (n)TREG cells were evaluated in the setting of allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using cord blood donors; more recently, the same&#xD;
      research group has developed ex vivo expanded (i)TREG cell therapy to limit transplant&#xD;
      complications. In addition, ex vivo expanded nTREG cells have been evaluated in the setting&#xD;
      of type I diabetes mellitus; this clinical trial found that TREG therapy was safe and at&#xD;
      least transiently effective in improving disease control. Furthermore, in the setting of&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a disease propagated by a severe Th1-driven&#xD;
      peripheral and central inflammatory response, a clinical trial of nTREG cell adoptive&#xD;
      transfer identified that the intervention was safe and showed promise in terms of ALS disease&#xD;
      amelioration. Finally, in a phase II study of rapamycin-resistant Th2 cell therapy in the&#xD;
      setting of low-intensity allogeneic HCT, adoptive Th2 cell transfer was safe and associated&#xD;
      with a shift towards Th2 polarization in vivo, preservation of donor engraftment,&#xD;
      stabilization of mixed chimerism, a low rate of GVHD, and potent anti-tumor effects in&#xD;
      patients with refractory hematologic malignancy. Collectively, these clinical trial results&#xD;
      indicate that the adoptive transfer of TREG and Th2-type populations can be safely&#xD;
      administered, even in the allogeneic HCT setting, and can mediate beneficial modulation of&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ex vivo manufacturing can be utilized to generate induced (i)TREG cells from the post-thymic&#xD;
      pool of peripheral T cells. In the current protocol, the manufacturing method will focus upon&#xD;
      mTOR inhibition, which is an established intervention that promotes the induction of TREG&#xD;
      cells. In combination with mTOR inhibition, the culture system that is utilized incorporates&#xD;
      cytokines that promote both a Th2 and a TREG phenotype, namely, IL-4, TGF-beta, and IL-2.&#xD;
      Finally, the protocol will include a TREG/Th2 cell product comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T&#xD;
      cell subsets, as these counter-regulatory T cell subsets express differential T cell receptor&#xD;
      (TCR) repertoires and a diversity of effector mechanisms that can potentially enhance an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect. For RAPA-501 manufacture, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are&#xD;
      collected from a steady-state apheresis and subjected to the following two-step culture&#xD;
      intervention: in step 1, a severe starvation step results in T cell de-differentiation, which&#xD;
      is realized through both selective media utilization and the addition of FDA-approved&#xD;
      pharmaceutical agents that potently inhibit mTOR signaling; and in step 2, re-differentiation&#xD;
      of T cells occurs using co-stimulation agents and Th2- and TREG-type polarizing cytokines.&#xD;
      After 6-days in culture, the resultant TREG/Th2 population is cryopreserved in single-use&#xD;
      aliquots at protocol-driven therapeutic doses. T cells of type II cytokine phenotype are&#xD;
      characterized in part by their expression of the transcription factor GATA3 whereas&#xD;
      regulatory T cell populations are identified in part by their expression of FOXP3&#xD;
      transcription factor. At culture initiation, a very low frequency of T cells express either&#xD;
      GATA3 or FOXP3. In contrast, the RAPA-501 cell product manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture&#xD;
      conditions expresses a high frequency of T cells that are either single-positive for GATA3,&#xD;
      single-positive for FOXP3, or double-positive for both GATA3 and FOXP3. Importantly, this&#xD;
      transcription factor profile is expressed in both manufactured CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is&#xD;
      important to note that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations with TREG function have been&#xD;
      defined, including a CD8+ TREG population that potently suppresses GVHD; it is potentially&#xD;
      advantageous to have both subsets represented in a therapeutic product because CD4+ and CD8+&#xD;
      TREG cells utilize differential effector mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T cell populations can suppress pathogenic effector T cell populations by several&#xD;
      defined mechanisms, including through expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidase molecules,&#xD;
      which act to hydrolyse pro-inflammatory ATP towards the immune suppressive adenosine&#xD;
      substrate . Indeed, TREG cells that express CD39 possess increased suppressive function and&#xD;
      have been associated with resolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, suppressive&#xD;
      function of human TREG cells is mediated in part by CD73. T cells manufactured in the&#xD;
      TREG/Th2 culture condition have an increase in expression of the TREG-associated effector&#xD;
      molecules, CD39 and CD73. In addition to the CD39/CD73 ectonucleotidases, TREG cell function&#xD;
      has also been correlated with expression of CD103, which is an integrin that dictates&#xD;
      epithelial lymphocyte localization. Indeed, CD103 and IL-2 receptor signaling cooperate to&#xD;
      maintain immune tolerance in the gut mucosa; furthermore, CD103-expressing TREG cells are&#xD;
      critical for amelioration of experimental chronic GVHD . T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2&#xD;
      culture condition have increased expression of the TREG effector molecule CD103.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experimental models, the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy is dependent upon successful&#xD;
      engraftment and in vivo T cell persistence. Importantly, the T cell differentiation state&#xD;
      helps dictate in vivo persistence, with less differentiated cells having increased&#xD;
      persistence. Murine rapamycin-resistant T cells, which expressed a T central memory (TCM)&#xD;
      phenotype, had increased in vivo engraftment potential relative to control T cells. In&#xD;
      addition, human rapamycin-resistant T cells also had increased engraftment in a&#xD;
      human-into-murine model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. T cells with reduced&#xD;
      differentiation relative to the T effector memory (TEM) population have increased in vivo&#xD;
      persistence and mediate increased in vivo effects, including the TCM subset, the naïve T cell&#xD;
      subset, and more recently, the T stem cell memory (TSCM) subset. This relationship between T&#xD;
      cell differentiation status and in vivo T cell function is relevant to TREG cells, as: (1)&#xD;
      TREG cells of TCM phenotype were more effective at reducing experimental GVHD relative to&#xD;
      TREG cells of TEM phenotype; and (2) TREG cells that expressed the stem cell marker CD150&#xD;
      were highly effective for the prevention of stem cell graft rejection. T cells manufactured&#xD;
      in the TREG/Th2 culture condition are enriched for cells having a reduced differentiation&#xD;
      state consistent with a T stem cell subset, including expression of the CD150 marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also important to assess the cytokine secretion profile of the manufactured RAPA-501&#xD;
      cells. First, it is critical that the cell product is capable of IL-4 secretion, which is the&#xD;
      driver cytokine for subsequent Th2 differentiation. Second, it is desirable that an&#xD;
      adoptively transferred T cell population is capable of secreting IL-2, as this capacity&#xD;
      indicates a progenitor function that permits T cells to expand more readily in vivo without&#xD;
      the need for exogenous IL-2 . Finally, it is important that the RAPA-501 cell population has&#xD;
      reduced secretion of the Th1- or Th17-type cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and GM-CSF.&#xD;
      The manufactured RAPA-501 cell product secretes IL-4 and IL-2 with minimal secretion of Th1-&#xD;
      or Th17-type cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T cells can also be defined in part by their ability to suppress the proliferation&#xD;
      or function of effector T cells. Importantly, manufactured TREG/Th2 cells potently suppress&#xD;
      Th1/Tc1 cell secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha. To assess the mechanism of suppression, experiments were performed using the&#xD;
      transwell assay, whereby effector T cells and RAPA-501 cells are separated by a filter that&#xD;
      prevents cell-to-cell contact but allows cell communication by small soluble mediators such&#xD;
      as cytokines. RAPA-501 cells acted in a TCR-independent manner to suppress the cytokine&#xD;
      secretion capacity of effector T cells. Because no co-stimulation was provided to the&#xD;
      transwell chamber containing RAPA-501 cells, RAPA-501 cells did not require co-stimulation to&#xD;
      modulate inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. The&#xD;
      following cytokines and chemokines were reduced by RAPA-501 cells in this transwell assay,&#xD;
      with relatively equal suppression mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of RAPA-501 cells: CCL1,&#xD;
      CCL2, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCL26, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, IL-6,&#xD;
      IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-10. The ability of TREG cells to consume IL-2 is a commonly&#xD;
      described phenomenon, although previous studies identified the requirement of cell-to-cell&#xD;
      contact for IL-2 consumption. As such, RAPA-501 cells are uniquely capable of modulating the&#xD;
      level of multiple inflammatory cytokines in a contact-independent manner. These results&#xD;
      suggest that RAPA-501 cells represent a suitable candidate for neutralization of multiple&#xD;
      cytokines and chemokines associated with various diseases, including viral-induced lung&#xD;
      inflammation. In light of this capacity of the RAPA-501 cell product to suppress T&#xD;
      cell-mediated inflammation in a TCR-independent manner, RAPA-501 therapy is highly suitable&#xD;
      for allogeneic, off-the-shelf treatment applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further experiments were performed to evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might also&#xD;
      regulate human CNS microglial cells, which are myeloid-derived cells that are analogous to&#xD;
      the peripheral monocyte population. To evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might&#xD;
      modulate pro-inflammatory microglial cells in a contact-independent manner, the ability of&#xD;
      RAPA-501 cells to reduce the inflammatory state of the microglial cell line HMC3 was tested&#xD;
      in a transwell assay. RAPA-501 cells reduced the HMC3 cell secretion of the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma and the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 at the relatively low&#xD;
      ratio of RAPA-501 cells to microglial cells of 1:40. These results demonstrate that the&#xD;
      RAPA-501 product is capable of inhibiting cytokine and chemokine secretion from&#xD;
      myeloid-derived populations in a contact- and TCR-independent manner, thereby providing a&#xD;
      further rationale for allogeneic, off-the-shelf utilization of the RAPA-501 product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPA-501 cell product for stability of T cell phenotype was also evaluated. That is, it has&#xD;
      been determined that a limiting factor of TREG cell therapy may be differentiation&#xD;
      plasticity, for example, whereby TREG cells can be influenced by inflammatory cytokines to&#xD;
      lose their TREG characteristics and adopt a Th1-type inflammatory state, which may then&#xD;
      promote disease pathogenesis. To address this possibility, the RAPA-501 cell capacity to&#xD;
      modulate T cell differentiation transcription factors after an extended culture interval that&#xD;
      involved T cell co-stimulation, the absence of mTOR inhibitors, and the presence of the&#xD;
      polarizing inflammatory cytokines IFN-alpha and IL-6 was studied. These experiments&#xD;
      demonstrated that the RAPA-501 cell product had remarkable differentiation stability&#xD;
      (continued expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; lack of up-regulation of&#xD;
      TBET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, RAPA-501 cells express a phenotype consistent with a regulatory T cell&#xD;
      population, including: stable expression of the TREG and Th2 transcription factors FOXP3 and&#xD;
      GATA3; expression of the TREG functional molecules CD39, CD73, and CD103; expression of a&#xD;
      reduced state of T cell differentiation, including expression of the stem cell marker CD150;&#xD;
      secretion of a Th2 pattern of cytokines with minimal secretion of Th1/Th17-type cytokines;&#xD;
      functional suppressive capacity against both effector Th1/Tc1 cells and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      myeloid cells, including reduced levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines;&#xD;
      and a capacity to inhibit inflammatory effectors in a contact- and TCR-independent manner.&#xD;
      Collectively, these characteristics of the RAPA-501 product predicts that this therapy&#xD;
      represents a novel and promising candidate to treat severe COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-human phase 1/phase 2b study evaluating allogeneic RAPA-501 cell therapy&#xD;
      in participants with severe, post-intubation Stage 3 COVID-19 disease. Two phase 1 cohorts&#xD;
      will be evaluated, namely, a low-dose Cohort 1 (40 x 10^6 cells/infusion) and a high-dose&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (160 x 10^6 cells/infusion); this phase 1 component will utilize&#xD;
      dose-limiting-toxicity (DLT) as a primary endpoint. Provided that safety is demonstrated in&#xD;
      the phase 1 study component, each RAPA-501 dose cohort can be evaluated in the randomized&#xD;
      phase 2b component. In the phase 2b component, for each RAPA-501 dose level determined to be&#xD;
      safe, patients will be randomized to receive RAPA-501 cells (n=19) or placebo (n=19). After&#xD;
      infusion of either RAPA-501 cells or placebo, these randomized cohorts will continue on&#xD;
      standard-of-care therapy (not protocol-driven). The primary endpoint of the phase 2b study is&#xD;
      30-day mortality, with the statistical goal of reducing mortality in RAPA-501 recipients&#xD;
      relative to the randomized, placebo-control cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants must be hospitalized patients with severe, post-intubation Stage 3&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease, specifically: SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by RT-PCR or equivalent&#xD;
      test; pulmonary infiltrate on radiologic examination; and respiratory insufficiency that&#xD;
      required intubation and mechanical ventilation initiated within 4 days prior to RAPA-501&#xD;
      therapy. The study consists of: (1) a study enrollment step (screening); and (2) after&#xD;
      eligibility is confirmed, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be performed. On Cohort 1, infusion&#xD;
      of RAPA-501 cells will be at a dose of 40 x 10^6 cells/infusion; three participants will be&#xD;
      initially treated, with one week separating participants in this phase 1 component to&#xD;
      evaluate for DLT, which will be defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity attributable to&#xD;
      RAPA-501 cells within 7-days of infusion. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be&#xD;
      safe (either 0/3 or 1/6 having a DLT), then Cohort 1 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the&#xD;
      randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day&#xD;
      mortality. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe, treatment on Cohort 2 can&#xD;
      be initiated, which will evaluate the infusion of RAPA-501 cells at a dose of 160 x 10^6&#xD;
      cells/infusion. In the same manner as Cohort 1, if Cohort 2 therapy is deemed to be safe,&#xD;
      Cohort 2 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to&#xD;
      address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. The study will be comprised&#xD;
      of three main stages: (1) the above-detailed 30-day interval relating to the primary study&#xD;
      objectives; (2) an extended, total 90-day interval to continue relatively intensive clinical&#xD;
      monitoring of potential efficacy and safety endpoints; and (3) an extended, total 6-month&#xD;
      interval to provide long-term clinical follow-up and to continue to monitor for laboratory&#xD;
      parameters relating to immune and viral endpoints.&#xD;
