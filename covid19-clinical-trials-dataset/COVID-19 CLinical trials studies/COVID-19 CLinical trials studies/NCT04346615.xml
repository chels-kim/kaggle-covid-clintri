  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a CGRP receptor antagonist may potentially blunt&#xD;
      the severe inflammatory response at the alveolar level, delaying or reversing the path&#xD;
      towards oxygen desaturation, ARDS, requirement for supplemental oxygenation, artificial&#xD;
      ventilation or death in patients with COVID-19 on supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * BHV-3500, formerly &quot;vazegepant&quot;, is now referred to as &quot;zavegepant&quot; (za ve' je pant). The&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee&#xD;
      revised the name to &quot;zavegepant&quot; which was accepted by the United States Adopted Names (USAN&#xD;
      ) Council for use in the U.S. and is pending formal adoption by the INN for international&#xD;
      use.&#xD;

             of any protocol-required procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must agree to provide all requested demographic information (i.e. gender,&#xD;
             race)&#xD;

             infrequently will not be excluded as long the subject was not taking them on a daily&#xD;
             basis and does not take them during the current study&#xD;

             empiric antibiotics are permitted.&#xD;

             the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose&#xD;
