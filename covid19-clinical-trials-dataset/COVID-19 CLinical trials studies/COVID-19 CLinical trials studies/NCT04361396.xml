  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the virus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the&#xD;
      disease COVID-19, is present in the abdominal cavity during emergency laparoscopic&#xD;
      exploration in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new human coronavirus responsible for pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China in December&#xD;
      2019 and has spread rapidly worlwide. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very&#xD;
      polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome. Research institutions are working restlessly to&#xD;
      elucidate the physiopathology of COVID-19 to develop new and more efficacious strategies on&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment and prevention planning. However, many aspects of the disease process&#xD;
      are still unknown. Despite the lack of complete understanding of COVID-19, recommandations&#xD;
      from world health authorities to surgical societies have been published in order to prevent&#xD;
      viral transmission within the hospital setting. Concerning prevention of viral transmission&#xD;
      during laparoscopy on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, strict measures were taken to&#xD;
      protect surgical and anesthesia staff. These recommandations are mainly based on avoiding&#xD;
      leak of pneumoperitoneum during surgical exploration as it may represent a potential source&#xD;
      of viral transmission, eventhough there is no scientific evidence on it. The lack of evidence&#xD;
      of this mode of transmission makes difficult to develop more appropriate and efficacious&#xD;
      recommandations. This study is designed to assess for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the&#xD;
      peritoneal serosa during emergency laparoscopy on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.&#xD;
      During laparoscopic surgical exploration, 3 samples of pneumoperitoneum will be taken in 3&#xD;
      standardized steps of the procedure. Two more other samples of peritoneal effusion or&#xD;
      peritoneal lavage (in the absence of peritoneal effusion) and bile (if cholecystectomy is&#xD;
      performed) will also be collected.&#xD;
