  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of a tailored, multicomponent exercise&#xD;
      training with post-COVID-19 syndrome (i.e. patients who present symptoms &gt;12 weeks once the&#xD;
      acute phase of the disease is over). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of a tailored exercise-based treatment relative to the control&#xD;
      arm in improving the subject clinical status in ambulatory patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A fraction ~10% of the COVID-19 patients who undergo a variable acute symptomatic phase of&#xD;
      the disease are coming forward with continuing effects of the disease over a month, with&#xD;
      chronic complaints like mental fog, delayed latent periods in recalling events of recent&#xD;
      past, tachycardia, extreme fatigue, inability to perform daily physical tasks and likely to&#xD;
      develop stress, depression, irritability, insomnia, fear, confusion, anger and frustration.&#xD;
      This condition is defined as post-COVID-19 syndrome and increasingly affecting a high number&#xD;
      of people as the pandemic evolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-COVID-19 syndrome has become a usual situation in the evolutionary course of the&#xD;
      disease with its own entity. The National Health Service (NHS) of UK has recently published a&#xD;
      clinical guide for long-term management of the effects of COVID-19 with a comprehensive plan&#xD;
      for the assessment and care of patients who present or develop symptoms from the fourth week&#xD;
      after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effective long-term management of the effects of COVID-19 is a challenge that requires&#xD;
      awareness. The RECOVE project aims at determining the role of exercise in the treatment of&#xD;
      post-COVID-19 syndrome ambulatory patients.&#xD;

    <description>Participants from the experimental group will complete 8 weeks of a tailored, educational and supervised multicomponent exercise program adapted from the ACSM guidelines for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Cardiovascular Disease. Concurrent training (i.e., develop both aerobic capacity and strength within the same training session) will be adopted since its greater adherence and proven adaptations in 6 weeks. Participants will complete a 3-days-a-week training routine: two days of resistance training (RT, 50-75% 1RM (one-repetition maximum), 2-4 sets, 6-12 repetitions, 5 exercises) combined with Moderate Intensity Variable Training (MIVT: 4-6 x 3-5 min at 65-80% Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) / 2-3 min at 50-70% HRR), and one day of Light Intensity Continuous Training (LICT: 30-60 min, 65-70% HRR). Progressions will be individualized and consistent with patient tolerance. Sessions will be supervised by certified strength and conditioning coaches, Graduated in Sports Sciences</description>
