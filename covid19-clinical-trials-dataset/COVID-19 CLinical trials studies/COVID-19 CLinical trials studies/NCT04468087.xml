      A key strategy in the treatment of COVID-19 would be to find an effective antiviral agent&#xD;
      that would decrease the peak viral load and, consequently, the associated degree of&#xD;
      immunopathological damage that follows this phase. The clinically approved substances&#xD;
      considered for this study are used for treatment of other virus diseases, like HIV&#xD;
      (atazanavir) and HCV (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir). Severe progression of COVID-19 among&#xD;
      patients under treatment for these aforementioned viruses is empirical less common. Besides,&#xD;
      the clinical rationale, there are pre-clinical evidence pointing out that patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 could benefit from treatments with atazanavir, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have planned an randomized, adaptive, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to be carried&#xD;
      out in 3 seamless stages. The first two stages are phase 2 studies with a third stage phase 3&#xD;
      to be conducted conditional to success of the first phase 2 and second phase 2 stages&#xD;
      including efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, there is great interest in the possibility of combining the phase II and phase&#xD;
      III stages of the development process and this is the focus here. Phase II trials can be&#xD;
      thought of as part of the learning stage where dose selection and appropriate treatment&#xD;
      groups are assessed together with initial indications of their effects. Phase III trials are&#xD;
      usually more confirmatory in nature where the treatment effects of the selected treatments&#xD;
      are assessed in a full-scale trial. Seamless phase II/III trials are concerned with combining&#xD;
      these two aspects into a single trial. There are a clearly advantages of speed in that the&#xD;
      dose selection and treatment effects are assessed within a single trial rather than&#xD;
      establishing separate trials. In addition, all data available for the selected dose are used&#xD;
      in the analysis rather than just those from the second stage with a consequent gain in power.&#xD;
      The savings in the number of patients is achieved by applying a form of screening of&#xD;
      competing treatments in the initial phase and abandoning those that are ineffective before&#xD;
      the end of the study following pre-established premises of futility. Effect estimates,&#xD;
      confidence intervals and p values need some statistical adjustments to allow for this,&#xD;
      otherwise they will be biased towards a benefit of the treatment. This study design, starting&#xD;
      with a phase II, could give us a treatment regimen composed of one or more repurposed&#xD;
      antivirals drugs that could improve the clinical outcomes of those hospitalized with COVID-19&#xD;
      reducing time to recovery and the need for respiratory support. It will be conducted in about&#xD;
      60 Brazilian hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of drugs rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atazanavir: Atazanavir is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease and is not associated&#xD;
           with significant dyslipidemia, as observed with other protease inhibitors.15 It was&#xD;
           approved by the FDA on January 29, 201516,17 as a combination of atazanavir and&#xD;
           cobicistat. Atazanavir can also be combined with ritonavir18 In a protease-free cell&#xD;
           assay, atazanavir blocked the major protease activity of SARS-Cov-2 at a concentration&#xD;
           of 10 μM. In in vitro models of viral infection/replication performed on Vero cells, a&#xD;
           human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary human monocytes, atazanavir inhibited&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 replication; in addition, the concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and&#xD;
           tumor necrosis factor type alpha (TNF-α) induced by the virus were reduced.10 Currently,&#xD;
           no clinical study is registered on the ClinicalTrials.com website to assess the effects&#xD;
           of atazanavir in the context of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daclastavir: Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits HCV replication by&#xD;
           binding to the N- terminal of the NS5A protein, affecting viral RNA replication. NS5A is&#xD;
           a multifunctional protein in the HCV replicative cycle, involved in the enrollment of&#xD;
           cell lipid bodies, RNA binding and replication, protein phosphorylation, cell signaling&#xD;
           and antagonism of interferon pathways.19 In an in vitro study, daclatasvir consistently&#xD;
           inhibited the production of SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles in Vero cells, in the HuH-7&#xD;
           cell line and in Calu-3 cells, with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 μM, respectively.&#xD;
           Daclatasvir reached early events during the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and&#xD;
           prevented the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α, inflammatory mediators associated with the&#xD;
           cytokine storm typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection.20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sofosbuvir/daclastavir:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sofosbuvir (SOVALDI®) is a nucleotide analog directed against HCV NS5B polymerase, clinically&#xD;
      approved with potent antiviral effects on the hepatitis C virus with several genotypes21. It&#xD;
      is proposed that the drug could be a potential option in the treatment of COVID-19 especially&#xD;
      at the beginning of the disease and before the invasion of the virus in the cells of the lung&#xD;
      parenchyma, based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of HCV and&#xD;
      coronavirus22. In vitro, sofosbuvir showed EC50 values of 6.2 and 9.5 µM in HuH-7 (hepatoma)&#xD;
      and Calu-3 (type II pneumocytes) cells respectively, although inactive in Vero cells (these&#xD;
      cells are unable to make this conversion sofosbuvir in the pro-drug to active form)11.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Main questions: The aim of the Coalition IX REVOLUTIOn evaluation is to answer the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are antiviral candidates (atazavir, daclatasvir/sofosbuvir) able to reduce the viral&#xD;
           load of SARS-CoV-2 compared to placebo in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with ≤ 7&#xD;
           days of symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which antiviral alone has the best effect in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
           patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with ≤ 7 days of symptoms? And which is the second&#xD;
           most effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are combined antiviral candidates able to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 compared&#xD;
           to antiviral alone and placebo in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with ≤ 7 days of&#xD;
           symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are isolated or combined antiviral candidates safe compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the antiviral candidate alone or in combination improve clinical outcomes (days&#xD;
           free of respiratory support in 15 days) compared with placebo in patients hospitalized&#xD;
           with COVID-19 with ≤ 7 days of symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary/secondary objectives Primary objectives Phase II/ 1st and 2nd stages: Assess the&#xD;
      effect of treatment with antivirals alone or combined with each other compared to placebo in&#xD;
      reducing the of viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained at baseline&#xD;
      (d0) and days 3, 6 and 10; Phase III: Evaluate the effectiveness of best antivirals from&#xD;
      Phase II alone or combined compared to placebo in increasing days free of respiratory support&#xD;
      defined as the number of days without oxygen, non-invasive ventilation / high-flow nasal&#xD;
      cannula or mechanical ventilation in 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ordinal 7-stage scale for clinical outcomes on the 15th day (1. not hospitalized with&#xD;
           resumption of normal activities; 2. not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal&#xD;
           activities; 3. hospitalized, without the need for supplemental oxygen; 4. hospitalized ,&#xD;
           requiring supplemental oxygen; 5. hospitalized, requiring high-flow nasal oxygen&#xD;
           therapy, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or both; 6. hospitalized, requiring blood&#xD;
           oxygenation through the membrane system, invasive mechanical ventilation or both; 7.&#xD;
           Death);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intubation in 28 days (time to event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mortality in 28 days (time to event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time to discharge, defined as the number of days from randomization to discharge, within&#xD;
           28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse events that was not present at patient's admission, defined by&#xD;
           the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric&#xD;
           Adverse Events (corrected version 2.1, July, 2017); 53&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and enrollment: The randomization list will be generated electronically using&#xD;
      appropriate software. Randomization will be performed in blocks and stratified by center. The&#xD;
      allocation concealment will be maintained through a centralized, automated, internet-based&#xD;
      randomization system, available 24 hours a day. Hospitalized patients with the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be allocated in an allocation ratio 3: 3: 3: 1: 1: 1 (3 for each treatment&#xD;
      group and 1 for placebo) in Phase II / 1. The parameter of interest for the efficacy decision&#xD;
      will be the comparison of the decay rates (slope) of the viral load logarithm from RT-PCR to&#xD;
      COVID-19 in 10 days between the treatment groups in comparison with the control (placebo). In&#xD;
      the 2nd stage, we will allocate patients in the ratio 2: 2: 1: 1 (2 for each active arm and 1&#xD;
      for each placebo) and the same statistic, now comparing combined treatment against the&#xD;
      treatment selected in phase II / 1 and placebo, since it is already known that the treatment&#xD;
      of phase II / 1 is effective for reducing viral load according to the pre specified criteria.&#xD;
      As long as we have success on primary outcome of Phase II/2, Phase III will proceed in a 2: 1&#xD;
      allocation ratio (2 active treatments for each placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:This is a double-blind study for participants of the same active drug and&#xD;
      researchers. Both participant and investigator can know, after randomization, which&#xD;
      medication they were allocated to. However, none will know whether the capsule to be&#xD;
      administered is active or placebo, ensuring blinding within that specific group to which the&#xD;
      participant was allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and analysis: 252 patients in total in phase II first stage (189 in active groups&#xD;
      and 63 in placebo) and 189 patients in total in phase II second stage (126 in active groups&#xD;
      and 63 in placebo). In case of success in Phase II, 564 additional participants will be&#xD;
      recruited in phase 3 (376 in the active group and 188 in the placebo). Thus, at the end of&#xD;
      phase III, we will have 314 patients evaluated in the Placebo group and between 439 and 502&#xD;
      patients in the treatment group.&#xD;
