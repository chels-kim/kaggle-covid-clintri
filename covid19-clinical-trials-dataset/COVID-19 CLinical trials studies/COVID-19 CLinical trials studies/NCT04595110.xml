  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with the occurrence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular adverse events including acute myocardial injury, acute heart failure, cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias, and thromboembolic disease. These complications represent an important issue in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients accounting for the increased morbidity and mortality of this syndrome.&#xD;
      According to a scoping review, venous thromboembolism and stroke occurred in approximately&#xD;
      20% and 3% of patients, respectively, with higher frequency observed in severely ill patients&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care units. Despite the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the&#xD;
      thrombotic risk still remained elevated in severe COVID-19 patients, and the optimal doses&#xD;
      and timing of anticoagulation are not yet defined. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated&#xD;
      thrombosis recognizes a prominent role of endothelial damage induced by both direct viral&#xD;
      injury and an excessive and aberrant hyper-inflammatory host immune response associated to an&#xD;
      increase in infection-related cytokines and chemokines. The occurrence of a hypercoagulable&#xD;
      state in COVID-19 patients associated to a profound endothelial cell activation/dysfunction&#xD;
      can result in the pathological phenomenon of immunothrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, in a prospective cohort of consecutive COVID-19 hospitalized patients, an&#xD;
      extensive characterization of the hemostatic alterations were performed, in order to: 1)&#xD;
      clarify mechanisms underlying the coagulopathy in these patients; 2) how and to what extent&#xD;
      the concomitant infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect this coagulopathy; and 3) identify&#xD;
      biomarkers potentially predictive of disease outcome (i.e. any thrombotic recurrence and&#xD;
      death).&#xD;

      Blood samples for hemostasis study are collected from all study subjects at admission. After&#xD;
      discarding the first 2-3 mL of blood, peripheral venous blood samples were collected into 6&#xD;
      mL vacuum tubes (BD, Vacutainer ™, Plymouth, UK) containing 3.2% citrate (0.109 mol/L, 1:9&#xD;
      vol./vol.) for coagulation studies, and K3-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (K3-EDTA) 7.2mg&#xD;
      for the complete blood cell count study.&#xD;
