      The objective of this study is to compare the Chronomics test against the NPS tests and&#xD;
      protocol currently in use to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The principal question&#xD;
      is: Does the Chronomics saliva based test perform as well as the NPS NHS test?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China. Just a month later,&#xD;
      Covid-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020.&#xD;
      The World Health Organisation (WHO) repeatedly announced that 'Diagnostic testing for&#xD;
      COVID-19 is critical to tracking the virus, understanding epidemiology, informing case&#xD;
      management, and to suppressing transmission'. The priority within Public Health England (PHE)&#xD;
      was to scale up public health testing using molecular diagnosis through real-time RT-PCR&#xD;
      (RdRp gene) assay based on oral swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the key challenges publicly presented regarding testing are speed of mobilisation,&#xD;
      supply chain issues due to the international demand for crucial testing materials like kits,&#xD;
      swabs and chemical reagents, and the quality and comfort of the nasopharyngeal (NSP) swabs&#xD;
      commonly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronomics has developed novel methods to address these problems. Firstly, due to the&#xD;
      shortage of the specific branded reagent products used in the official CDC FDA EUA COVID-19&#xD;
      RT-qPCR protocol for RNA extraction, Chronomics have sourced and compiled testing of&#xD;
      components to create our own extraction kit with greater availability of supply for use&#xD;
      within the protocol. Secondly, our methods are based on saliva collection which are pain-free&#xD;
      and easy to collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the Chronomics test against the NPS tests and&#xD;
      protocol currently in use to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The principal question&#xD;
      is: Does the Chronomics saliva based test perform as well as the NPS NHS test? There are two&#xD;
      components of our testing framework that we are looking to validate to feed into this.&#xD;
      Firstly, that our alternative reagents and workflow (RNA-extraction and RT-PCR steps) do not&#xD;
      impact sensitivity of detection and secondly, that our alternative sampling source of saliva&#xD;
      also does not impact sensitivity of detection. To achieve validation of these two components,&#xD;
      we will compare both a Chronomics saliva sample vs an NHS NPS sample, and a Chronomics NPS&#xD;
      sample vs an NHS NPS sample. We would require access to the output (and information as to the&#xD;
      linked patient) for the NHS gold-standard workflow.&#xD;
