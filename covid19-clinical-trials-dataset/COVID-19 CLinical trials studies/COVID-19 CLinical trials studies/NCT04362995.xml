  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective adaptive cohort study of St. Jude employees to determine the rate of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic and to evaluate immunological responses to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the proportion of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a&#xD;
           population of SARS-CoV-2-naïve adult St. Jude employees&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To comprehensively map CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes and response magnitudes to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           infection in a population of SARS-CoV-2-naïve adult St. Jude employees who acquire&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at baseline, and identify&#xD;
           the rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 in a population of presumably naïve adult St.&#xD;
           Jude employees&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify features of T cell responses at baseline and during SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
           that are associated with protection against symptomatic or severe COVID-19 disease in a&#xD;
           population of adult St. Jude employees&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish additional immunological features including host immune or receptor&#xD;
           polymorphisms associated with response to SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity and specific features in a circumscribed population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the presence, characteristics, and proportion of short-term re-infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if an association between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal swab specimens and&#xD;
           COVID-19 symptoms can be identified in a population of adult St. Jude employees who&#xD;
           acquire SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the laboratory and clinical response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a population of&#xD;
           adult St. Jude employees with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naive individuals will contribute a baseline blood sample at enrollment. Subsequent routine&#xD;
      blood draws will occur to determine the proportion of participants who have asymptomatically&#xD;
      seroconverted; the timing of these blood draws and proportion of participants required will&#xD;
      be determined by the rate of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in the cohort according to an&#xD;
      adaptive study design. Subjects will be tracked for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and CD4,&#xD;
      and CD8 T cell responses throughout the period and especially during the early stages after&#xD;
      clearance of infection and subsequently to determine the quality and duration of memory&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to blood samples, participants will intermittently provide nasal swabs for&#xD;
      detection of SARS-CoV-2; this will occur either through a comprehensive proactive employee&#xD;
      screening program, or specifically for the purposes of the research study if participants are&#xD;
      required to attend campus but are not currently eligible for employee screening. These will&#xD;
      determine duration and characteristics of viral shedding and identify reinfection.&#xD;
      Seroprevalence estimates and asymptomatic conversion will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection will have two additional blood draws in&#xD;
      the acute and convalescent phase to identify acute and late immune responses. These responses&#xD;
      will be compared to the essential baseline sample data to characterize the generation of de&#xD;
      novo and cross-reactive recall responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those participants receiving vaccination, blood draws will be taken after COVID vaccine&#xD;
      (3-8 weeks after completion of 1 or 2 dose course) and at completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, subjects will complete a baseline online personal health and demographic&#xD;
      questionnaire, and then monthly brief online health update questionnaires. Throughout the&#xD;
      study period, subjects will complete a brief online symptom survey every 2 weeks.&#xD;
