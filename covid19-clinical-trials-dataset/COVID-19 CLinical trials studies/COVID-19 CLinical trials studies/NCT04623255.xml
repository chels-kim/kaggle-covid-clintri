      The rationale in severe COVID19 infection is to undertake PEX to aid reduction of the&#xD;
      hyperinflammation and reduce the morbidity and mortality to the lungs, but also systemically,&#xD;
      such as the heart, kidneys and brain. A feasibility study of PEX therapy has been undertaken&#xD;
      and confirmed a reduction in the inflammatory markers, no VTE/arterial events and&#xD;
      normalisation of the renal function and cardiac function throughout the period of therapy. As&#xD;
      plasma exchange is an intensive treatment modality, blocks of 5 daily PEX will be undertaken.&#xD;
      Further blocks of PEX treatment can be initiated as dictated by the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters. Unlike many therapeutic schedules, there is no immunosuppression associated with&#xD;
      PEX; indeed, the resulting decrease in inflammatory markers were shown to be associated with&#xD;
      an increase and sustained lymphocytes count.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID19 is a viral pandemic associated with primarily respiratory pathology, in the form of&#xD;
      microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. In patients requiring hospital admission, there&#xD;
      is severe disease, requiring respiratory support, from high dose oxygen therapy or&#xD;
      ventilatory assistance, which may be invasive or non invasive. The pathology of COVID19 is&#xD;
      poorly understood, but it is accepted there is an inflammatory-thrombotic basis. Despite&#xD;
      current therapeutic platforms, there is no consensus on a specific therapy within a trial&#xD;
      setting that has proven benefit in severe COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombotic microangiopathies, such as TTP, are a different disease, but have a comparable&#xD;
      prothrombotic phenotype, and similar or higher inflammatory parameters, including D Dimers,&#xD;
      ferritin, LDH and IL-6 at acute presentation and resolve with plasma exchange (PEX). The&#xD;
      rationale in severe COVID19 infection is to undertake PEX to aid reduction of the&#xD;
      hyperinflammation and reduce the morbidity and mortality to the lungs, but also systemically,&#xD;
      such as the heart, kidneys and brain. A feasibility study of PEX therapy has been undertaken&#xD;
      and confirmed a reduction in the inflammatory markers, no VTE/arterial events and&#xD;
      normalisation of the renal function and cardiac function throughout the period of therapy. As&#xD;
      plasma exchange is an intensive treatment modality, blocks of 5 daily PEX will be undertaken.&#xD;
      Further blocks of PEX treatment can be initiated as dictated by the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters. Unlike many therapeutic schedules, there is no immunosuppression associated with&#xD;
      PEX; indeed, the resulting decrease in inflammatory markers were shown to be associated with&#xD;
      an increase and sustained lymphocytes count. Therefore, as patients with COVID-19 have&#xD;
      elevated procoagulant factors including VWF and factor VIII secondary to direct endothelial&#xD;
      activation. This is associated with an exaggerated pro-inflammatory immune response and&#xD;
      microvascular thrombosis; resulting in multi-organ dysfunction and eventually death. PEX will&#xD;
      improve coagulopathy, as measured by VWF:ADAMTS 13 ratio and D Dimers, with an associated&#xD;
      reduction in inflammation, organ-related microthrombosis, and ventilatory support.&#xD;
