      As of February 17th, 2020, China has 76396 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19), including 2348 deaths. As the national medical team sent to Wuhan, the&#xD;
      investigators proposed a psychological and physical rehabilitation based humanistic care&#xD;
      regimen generated from experience in treating patients with COVID-19. The healthcare workers&#xD;
      faced greater mental and physical pressure under long-term, high-intensity, high-risk working&#xD;
      conditions. The investigators want to apply this regimen to the healthcare workers who&#xD;
      participated in the treatment of COVID-19, to evaluate the positive effect of humanistic care&#xD;
      on preventing depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
