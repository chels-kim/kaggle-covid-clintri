  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) represents the biggest medical&#xD;
      challenge in decades. Whilst COVID-19 mainly affects the lungs it also affects multiple organ&#xD;
      systems, including the cardiovascular system. There are documented associations between&#xD;
      severity of disease and risk of death and To provide all the information required by review&#xD;
      bodies and research information systems, we ask a number of specific questions. This section&#xD;
      invites you to give an overview using language comprehensible to lay reviewers and members of&#xD;
      the public. Please read the guidance notes for advice on this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 DRAFT Full Set of Project Data IRAS Version 5.13 advancing age, male sex and associated&#xD;
      comorbid disease (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD and cancer).&#xD;
      The most common complications include cardiac dysrhythmia, cardiac injury, myocarditis, heart&#xD;
      failure, pulmonary embolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that the mechanism of action of the virus involves binding to a host&#xD;
      transmembrane enzyme (angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) to enter some lung, heart and&#xD;
      immune cells and cause further damage. While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, it is&#xD;
      unclear if the use of the common antihypertensive drugs ACE inhibitors or angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARBs) alter prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to look closely at the health of the vascular system of patients after being&#xD;
      treated in hospital for COVID-19 (confirmed by PCR test) and compare them to patients who had&#xD;
      a hospital admission for suspected COVID-19 (negative PCR test) . Information from this study&#xD;
      is essential so that clinicians treating patients with high blood pressure understand the&#xD;
      impact of the condition and these hypertension medicines in the context of the current&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. This will allow doctors to effectively treat and offer advice to patients&#xD;
      currently prescribed these medications or who are newly diagnosed with hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is pandemic and, though it primarily affects the lungs, there is evidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular system involvement. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic&#xD;
      cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes,&#xD;
      macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial&#xD;
      dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque&#xD;
      instability, and myocardial infarction. While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, it is&#xD;
      unclear if the use of the common antihypertensive drugs ACE inhibitors or angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers alter prognosis.&#xD;
