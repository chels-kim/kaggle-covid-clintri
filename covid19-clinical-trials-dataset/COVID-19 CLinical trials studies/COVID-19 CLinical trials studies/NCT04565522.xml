      Patients on dialysis are at risk for several infectious diseases, since they have reduced&#xD;
      immunological and have to regularly attend dialysis centres even if a pandemic is going on.&#xD;
      Dialysis patients and healthcare professionals of dialysis centres can become infected one&#xD;
      with the other. The incident risk of COVID-19 in dialysis centres is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the challenges of an early diagnosis of COVID-19, the likely transmission with&#xD;
      outbreaks, the possibility of reciprocal transmission of the infection among patients and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals, the frequent clinical severity of COVID-19 in dialysis patients&#xD;
      because of the coexistence of several comorbidities, CONTACT TRACING could be an effective&#xD;
      and efficient tool to contrast COVID-19 spreading in dialysis centres.&#xD;

      Patients on dialysis are at risk for several infectious diseases, since they have reduced&#xD;
      immunological and have to regularly attend dialysis centres from once to thrice a week&#xD;
      depending on their residual renal function even if a pandemic is going on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysis patients and healthcare professionals of dialysis centres can become infected one&#xD;
      with the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incident risk of COVID-19 in dialysis centres is still unknown. Given the challenges of&#xD;
      an early diagnosis of COVID-19, the likely transmission with outbreaks, the possibility of&#xD;
      reciprocal transmission of the infection among patients and healthcare professionals, the&#xD;
      frequent clinical severity of COVID-19 in dialysis patients because of the coexistence of&#xD;
      several comorbidities, CONTACT TRACING could be an effective and efficient tool to contrast&#xD;
      COVID-19 spreading in dialysis centres. This modality keeps trace of the contacts the new&#xD;
      COVID-19 case have had and allow the identification of other possible cases in that outbreak&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact tracing is the key tool to detect and trace COVID-19 cases among patients and health&#xD;
      care professionals, i.e. the space-time mapping of the contacts among these two categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily for healthcare professionals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At every dialysis session for haemodialysis patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At every hospital visit for patients on peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum follow will be up to 12 months excepting in those patients who develop a&#xD;
      COVID-19-related clinically significant event:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 with or without hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Respiratory insufficiency with the need of CPAP or mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Death associated or related to COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the participating centres, the enrolment of patients and healthcare professionals will be&#xD;
      prospective, progressive and competitive till the number of cases of COVD-19 will reach 200&#xD;
      subjects. If study participation will be 10% and COVID-19 will be taken by 4% of the patients&#xD;
      with no prior exposure to COVID-19, we can estimate to enrol 5000 subjects (dialysis patients&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals) over a period of 12 months in 50-150 centres. The length of the&#xD;
      enrolment period of 6-12 months will depend also on future evolution of the pandemic in the&#xD;
      Italian regions that have not been massively hit by the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be stored on a web-database, which will be created on purpose. Privacy&#xD;
      protection of patients and health care professionals will be pursued and granted by anonymous&#xD;
      data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the longitudinal and prospective design of the study, Kaplan-Meier curves will be used&#xD;
      to describe the incidence of COVID-19 infection and the survival of dialysis patients and&#xD;
      their healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cox multivariate analysis will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the incidence, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in the two categories&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate predictors and/or confounders associated with the incidence of the three study&#xD;
           outcomes (infection, morbidity and mortality)&#xD;
