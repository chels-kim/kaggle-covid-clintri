    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. The aim is to describe the natural history and clinical&#xD;
      evolution over time of hospitalized patients affected by Severe Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) infection, including the genetic pathology of the disease&#xD;
      and improve therapeutic procedures.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of the end of February 2020, the ASST of Monza, with its two hospital wards of Monza and&#xD;
      Desio, has treated 1433 COVID+ patients, of which 507 have currently been discharged (35.4%)&#xD;
      and 206 (14%) transferred to other Low-intensity care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of observational studies is now known in many fields of medicine and the &quot;real&#xD;
      life&quot; data produced have become an integral part of the authorization dossiers by the&#xD;
      competent authorities to govern the introduction of new drugs: in particular, in a disease&#xD;
      such as that from COVID-19 in which the absence of specific anti-viral therapies prevents an&#xD;
      &quot;ad hoc&quot; cure, it becomes fundamental to identify and validate systems of stratification of&#xD;
      the risk of fatal events, in order to optimize health intervention measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol provides the collection of clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic and&#xD;
      laboratory data consistent with the objectives of the study (CORE DATA SET) to which other&#xD;
      specific protocols and relative data will connect (DATABASE &quot;leaf&quot;). The data collection will&#xD;
      be performed on eCRF (RedCap platform) and the database will have the &quot;stem and leaf&quot;&#xD;
      structure, compatible with WHO indications regarding pandemic data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORE DATA SET:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol presents two important aspects of innovation in its formulation and design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The &quot;stem and leaf&quot; structure will allow to collect all the core data of the study&#xD;
           (&quot;stem&quot;) capable of describing the primary objective, that is the natural history of the&#xD;
           disease, thus providing an important contribution to knowledge, currently very scarce ,&#xD;
           the evolution of the disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the extreme heterogeneity of the pathology itself, the methods of spreading the&#xD;
           contagion and the problematic treatment of some particular patient populations, however&#xD;
           impose the description and the potential validation, not only in the context of subgroup&#xD;
           analyzes, but in studies dedicated, of the data collected The &quot;stem and leaf&quot; design&#xD;
           could therefore answer both questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological research areas that the protocol proposes to pursue are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study of genetic determinants of COVID-19 infection with the aim of identifying the&#xD;
           bases of the different susceptibility in relation to age, sex and presence of&#xD;
           co-morbidity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study of the repertoire of B and T lymphocyte receptors and identification of the&#xD;
           virus-specific sequences of the T receptor for the antigen with the aim of identifying&#xD;
           the component of the viral genome relevant to the immune response with possible relapses&#xD;
           for the development of a vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study of the activation of the inflammosome responsible for the abnormal and severe&#xD;
           inflammatory response characteristic of patients with COVID-19 infection and serious&#xD;
           lung complications with the aim of identifying possible specific targets of intervention&#xD;
           against one or more inflammatory cytokines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study of the serological response during the acute phase of the disease and&#xD;
           convalescence with the aim of defining the possible state of protection from the disease&#xD;
           itself;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study of the proteome with the aim of defining biomarkers capable of evaluate the risk&#xD;
           of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each specific protocol, the study design and statistical data analysis plan will be&#xD;
      formulated according to the specific objectives. In general, in addition to the descriptive&#xD;
      methods, statistical regression models and methods for the definition of prognostic scores&#xD;
      will be used, with relative cross-validation, which will allow to evaluate both binary and&#xD;
      survival outcomes (in a broad sense, of events considered in time).&#xD;
