      The primary goal of the study is to conduct the first systematic cardiac autopsy study in 60&#xD;
      patients dying from COVID-19 to understand the pathology and pathogenesis of cardiac injury&#xD;
      in patients with COVID-19, with/without cardiovascular comorbidities. Such data is essential&#xD;
      for understanding rate of involvement, type of involvement and degree of injury in patients&#xD;
      contracting the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since Dec 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      throughout the world. On April 21 2020, Italy and US have registered over 187,000 and 855,000&#xD;
      cases of confirmed COVID-19 disease respectively, with one of the highest death rates in the&#xD;
      world, which stands at more than 25,000 individuals in Italy and 47,000 in US. Epidemiologic&#xD;
      modeling from multiple groups indicate the scope of the problem, with a potential for over&#xD;
      200,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, with large percentage of the population infected. Mortality&#xD;
      from COVID-19 is associated with the presence of severe respiratory illness, although recent&#xD;
      studies indicate 20%-30% of patients have evidence of COVID-19 associated cardiac injury&#xD;
      defined as decline in ejection fraction or troponin I elevation (1,2). Anecdotal evidence&#xD;
      suggests the presence of abnormal EKG findings compatible with myocardial ischemia but&#xD;
      whether this is from epicardial coronary thrombosis, myocarditis, or microvascular thrombosis&#xD;
      remains uncertain although all have been postulated (3). Regardless, patients with cardiac&#xD;
      injury have higher mortality than those without, and sudden cardiac death has been described&#xD;
      in some of these patients (1). Two thirds of patients with cardiovascular history were more&#xD;
      likely to develop cardiac complications (4). Isolated reports have described fulminant&#xD;
      myocarditis in the setting of high viral load with autopsy findings consistent with&#xD;
      inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates (5). However, no systematic autopsy studies of patients&#xD;
      dying from COVID-19 have ever been conducted. The Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo had&#xD;
      treated about 2000 patients with COVID-19 and performed systematic cardiac autopsies from a&#xD;
      series of 60 patients who died or presented with/without a picture of cardiac injury and were&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive. Detailed clinical data on all these patients are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Much about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the heart remains unknown.&#xD;
      Angiotensin (AT) converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the cellular receptor for both&#xD;
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but also as an endogenous counter- regulator of the renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system (RAS). ACE2 is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels detected in the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system (cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      endothelial cells) as well as gut, kidneys and lungs. In general, loss of ACE2 increases&#xD;
      susceptibility to cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction and hypertension while&#xD;
      gain of function ACE2 has shown protective roles in various models of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (6). The bifunctional role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-COV-2 but also as a protective&#xD;
      factor against cardiovascular disease means careful understanding of the role of ACE2 during&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is needed. In this proposal investigators will examine cardiac tissues from&#xD;
      patients dying of COVID-19 and examine the effect of infection on the expression of ACE2 on&#xD;
      various cardiac cells. Investigators will also evaluate and validate this hypothesized&#xD;
      mechanism of viral entry by ACE2 and trans-membrane serine protease which promotes entry of&#xD;
      SARS-COV-2 into cells through a separate mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the cardiac pathological findings from series of 60 patients dying from&#xD;
           COVID-19 using cardiac samples sent to CVPath Institution from Papa Giovanni XXIII&#xD;
           Hospital, Bergamo, Italy to study the correlations between clinical risk factors and&#xD;
           myocardial findings and difference from other viral myocarditis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand the relationship between viral load in cardiac tissues and the extent of&#xD;
           damage seen on myocardial histological sections; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Co-localize the SARS-CoV-2 using RNAscope in situ hybridization, with its entry receptor&#xD;
           ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease) in different&#xD;
           cell types found in the heart, such as endothelial, smooth muscle, myocardial,&#xD;
           fibroblastic and inflammatory cells, to better understand the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by ethical committee at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital and the CVPath&#xD;
      Institute IRB (Institutional Review Board).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All specimens are fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Hearts will be shipped to CVPath in&#xD;
      accordance with all international shipping regulations and U.S. CDC (Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention) guidelines (www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem&#xD;
      specimens.html). The sample is given a unique identifier and the hearts are weighed after&#xD;
      blood clots have been removed from the cavities, and the heart ventricles are sliced parallel&#xD;
      to the posterior atrioventricular junction to determine absence of any necrosis or fibrosis.&#xD;
      Pulmonary emboli and any right ventricular abnormalities are assessed to rule out any&#xD;
      attributable cause of death. The heart is weighed and radiographed and if any calcification&#xD;
      is observed the epicardial coronary arteries are removed intact away from the heart and&#xD;
      segments decalcified according to the extent of calcification. The rest of the arteries are&#xD;
      submitted for paraffin embedding at 3-4 mm intervals to rule out any significant&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (75 % cross-sectional area stenosis) or any thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total six sections of myocardium (anterior, posterior, and lateral LV (left ventricle),&#xD;
      ventricular septum, anterior and posterior wall of the right ventricle) are routinely taken&#xD;
      transversely, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) for&#xD;
      histologic evaluation. If specific pathology is observed, additional sections will be&#xD;
      submitted to determine the etiology of the findings. Histologic examination is performed to&#xD;
      rule out any infiltrative or inflammatory process or any myofiber disarray of the myocardium,&#xD;
      intramyocardial small vessel disease of interstitial or focal fibrosis. Presence of any&#xD;
      cardiomyopathic process will be ruled out by gross and histologic examination. If the&#xD;
      post-mortem interval is short, transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination will be&#xD;
      performed to determine the presence of virus and the cell type harboring the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations with autopsy findings will be made with available anonymized clinical data&#xD;
      including EKG, echocardiography and cardiac catheterization (where available). The cardiac&#xD;
      pathological characteristics of COVID-19 will be compared to 60 viral myocarditis cases that&#xD;
      have previously been collected in CVPath Registry. A RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction) specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 will be conducted on RNA extracted from&#xD;
      myocardial samples to quantitate the amount of virus in myocardium for each sample. RNA&#xD;
      samples will also be taken from coronary arteries as well. Calculated viral load will be&#xD;
      correlated with the myocardial injury scores including myocardial necrosis, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, myocarditis, inflammatory cells numbers, type, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNAscope In-situ hybridization. In situ detection of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in&#xD;
      endothelial (VE-cadherin), myocardial (Cx43 and Myh6), smooth muscle cell (SM22 alpha) and&#xD;
      lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) will be performed using an RNAscope assay with RNAscope&#xD;
      Probe-V-nCoV2019-S-sense and Probe-V-nCoV2019-S (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following the&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocols. Correlation will be made with specific cell types mentioned by dual&#xD;
      immunofluorescence as previously described (7) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will result in a greater understanding of the pathology of cardiac injury in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19. Doing so will open the door to develop new therapeutic options to&#xD;
      treat these patients during an epidemic of unparalleled size and scope.&#xD;
