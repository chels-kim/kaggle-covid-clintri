  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the life of millions of people, with significant&#xD;
      socio-economic and psychological impact. Healthcare workers, in particular, are working with&#xD;
      high levels of stress and emotional exhaustion, with risk of long term consequences such as&#xD;
      stress and anxiety disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) in preventing and treating stress and anxiety disorders. Therefore,in this study&#xD;
      we aim at investigating the advantages of using a virtual reality-based protocol for reducing&#xD;
      stress and anxiety in healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is dramatically affecting the daily life of millions of people, with&#xD;
      serious socio-economic and mental health consequences. The negative effects on psychological&#xD;
      well-being affect all those people forced to isolation and/or quarantine, but above all the&#xD;
      medical staff, who works in conditions of high stress and high risk of contagion, and is&#xD;
      exposed to a high risk of developing psychopathological symptoms of stress and anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous scientific studies have shown how virtual reality represents one highly specialized&#xD;
      and effective tool for the prevention and treatment of stress-related psychopathological&#xD;
      symptoms and anxiety disorders. The use of this immersive technology can in fact help&#xD;
      patients both to process the emotional aspects of traumatic memories and to learn how to&#xD;
      manage anxiety, including relaxation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this context, the main goal of this study is to investigate the advantages of using a&#xD;
      virtual reality-based protocol for reducing stress and anxiety in healthcare workers involved&#xD;
      in the COVID-19 pandemic, to better support them in the difficult role of care and care and&#xD;
      to better clarify the influence of this methodology in terms of learning important&#xD;
      information relating to stress and anxiety (causes, symptoms, management techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of using&#xD;
      virtual reality experiences (i.e., a psychoeducational and a relaxing content) in reducing&#xD;
      psychopathological symptoms of stress and anxiety in a group of Italian doctors and nurses&#xD;
      involved in the COVID-19 crisis (VR Group), compared to a group that will try the same&#xD;
      content in a non-immersive mode (i.e., a text for psychoeducation and an audio for&#xD;
      relaxation) (Non-VR Group), and a waiting-list (WL Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate if the use of a virtual psychoeducational experience developed ad hoc on&#xD;
           stress and anxiety (i.e., MIND-VR) can facilitate the learning of basic information&#xD;
           related to psychopathological symptoms of this conditions of mental suffering (i.e,&#xD;
           causes, symptoms, management techniques) compared to a non-immersive modality (i.e.,&#xD;
           psychoeducational texts).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the efficacy of using a virtual reality relaxation content (i.e., COVID-Feel&#xD;
           Good,) for the reduction of stress and anxiety levels of healthcare personnel involved&#xD;
           in the care of COVID-19 patients&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study can be defined as a controlled and randomized clinical trial, single-blind and monocentric, aimed at studying the efficacy of the intervention with virtual reality contents in the reduction of psychopathological symptoms of stress and anxiety in healthcare personnel involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. The study will be conducted according to the indications of Good Clinical Practices. The clinical efficacy of the intervention will be assessed at four different time distances (T0, T1, T2 and T3). The distance between the end of the intervention (T1) and the subsequent follow-up (T2) will be 3 months. A further follow-up (T3) will be carried out 3 months after T2.</intervention_model_description>
