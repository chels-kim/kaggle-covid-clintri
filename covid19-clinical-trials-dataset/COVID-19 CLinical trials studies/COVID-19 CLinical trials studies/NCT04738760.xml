  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone which may have beneficial role in reducing COVID-19&#xD;
      adverse outcomes by first regulating the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Recent studies on&#xD;
      animal in which acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was induced, showed that vitamin D&#xD;
      lead to pulmonary permeability reduction by modulating RAS activity as well as the expression&#xD;
      of the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE2). During COVID-19, downregulation of ACE2 leads&#xD;
      to cytokine storm in the host, causing ARDS. In contrast, an experimental study conducted on&#xD;
      mice in which ARDS was induced chemically, revealed that vitamin D admiration contributed to&#xD;
      mRNA and ACE2 proteins levels improvement, ADRS milder symptoms as well as less lung damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, vitamin D had shown antiviral effects on several previous studies, that though&#xD;
      to be exerted either by antimicrobial peptides induction which subsequently had direct&#xD;
      antiviral action or through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, vitamin D stabilizes physical barriers which prevent viruses from reaching&#xD;
      tissues susceptible to infection. Finally, previous studies demonstrated that hypovitaminosis&#xD;
      D is accompanied by various comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic&#xD;
      cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancers, all medical conditions that are&#xD;
      considered risk factors of COVID-19 infection deterioration and even high mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether supplementation with high-dose vitamin D&#xD;
      improves the prognosis of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to a standard dose of&#xD;
      vitamin D.&#xD;
