  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to assess the impact of cheap, licenced and widely available investigational&#xD;
      products on the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2 groups of patients - those with&#xD;
      mild or moderate pneumonia (Cohort 1) and those with severe pneumonia (Cohort 2), through&#xD;
      randomisation to non-identical placebo or intervention arm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is adaptive in design, with the option to change the investigational products&#xD;
      should evidence change on the benefits/harms of the interventions being trialed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1. Currently index cases with mild COVID-19 or moderate pneumonia will be randomized&#xD;
      to ivermectin 0.3-0.4mg/Kg daily for 3 days (arms 1 and 2) or non-identical placebo (arm 3).&#xD;
      Index case randomization will also include HH members who will be treated with ivermectin&#xD;
      0.3-0.4mg/Kg daily for 3 days (arm 1) or non-identical placebo (arms 2 and 3). All households&#xD;
      will receive a preventative package (containing soap, bleach, cloth facemasks and&#xD;
      instructions on their use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2. Patients admitted to hospital meeting WHO criteria for severe COVID-19 pneumonia&#xD;
      will be randomized to aspirin 150mg daily or non-identical placebo for 28 days or until&#xD;
      hospital discharge (whichever is sooner). Other care will follow National guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at multiple sites in The Gambia, with the option to recruit from&#xD;
      other West African countries should this be necessary (subject to further local ethical&#xD;
      review/s).&#xD;

          -  Current active gastrointestinal haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe liver disease or severe kidney disease (severe liver disease defined as&#xD;
             cirrhosis with portal hypertension and history of variceal bleeding; severe kidney&#xD;
             disease defined as stage 4/5 KD, eGFR &lt;30ml/min)&#xD;
