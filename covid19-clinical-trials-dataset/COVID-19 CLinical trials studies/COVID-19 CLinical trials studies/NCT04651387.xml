    <textblock>
      The anti-viral efficacy of ozone against RNA viruses is already established. Ozone gas have&#xD;
      been already proposed as possible therapy for Covid-19 infection with insofar limited&#xD;
      success. The development of ozonized oil (HOO) solved this problems making ozone highly&#xD;
      stable and bioavailable due to its bound with the lipid carrier. HOO administration is&#xD;
      totally noninvasive occurring by oral administration of pills or as nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOO regimen could be proposed as complimentary therapeutic treatment for Covid-19 infection,&#xD;
      without the need of any modifications of the established standard therapeutic protocols. This&#xD;
      complimentary treatment, could be helpful to (a) decrease the severity of the diseases&#xD;
      lowering the number of Covid-19 patients requiring high-intensity therapies; (b) fasten qPCR&#xD;
      negativization after disease and time-span of hospital recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigates the effectiveness of combined use of &quot;HOO&#xD;
      capsules&quot; and &quot;HOO oropharyngeal and nasal spray&quot; as a therapeutic supplement in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are moderately ill.&#xD;

      The anti-viral efficacy of ozone against RNA viruses is already established. Ozone gas have&#xD;
      been already proposed as possible therapy for Covid-19 infection with insofar limited&#xD;
      success. Indeed, in this form, ozone is extremely volatile and its beneficial effects are&#xD;
      only transient. Furthermore, in these studies ozone was administered by&#xD;
      auto-hemo-transfusion, an invasive approach that cannot be pursued for preventive purposes in&#xD;
      healthy subjects or in severely affected patients. The development of ozonized oil (HOO)&#xD;
      solved this problems making ozone highly stable and bioavailable due to its bound with the&#xD;
      lipid carrier. HOO administration is totally noninvasive occurring by oral administration of&#xD;
      pills or as nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A challenge test was developed to identify new strategies to prevent Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
      Sensitive cells expressing the ACE2 receptor were challenged with oro-pharyngeal containing&#xD;
      high viral loads of Covid-19 and the amount of viral RNA able to penetrate inside the cells&#xD;
      quantified by qPCR. The ability to inhibit viral infection by UV radiation, hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide, anti-spike Covid-19 antibodies and HOO was comparatively evaluated. The only agent&#xD;
      able to fully neutralize Covid-19 was HOO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HOO efficacy in preventing finding is due to (a) the high sensitivity of Covid-19 to&#xD;
      oxidative stress; (b) the high lipophilicity of Covid-19 and the wide exposure of its lipid&#xD;
      envelope for the interaction with lipohilic HOO; (c) the sensitivity of Covid-19 spike&#xD;
      proteins to oxidative stress induced by HOO due to their high abundancy of neutrophilic&#xD;
      sulphur-rich sites; (d) the HOO capacity to penetrate inside the cells arresting Covid-19&#xD;
      intra-cellular assembly; (e) HOO anti-inflammatory properties causing inhibition of pulmonary&#xD;
      macrophage activation, thromboxane release and consequent pulmonary thrombo-embolism, a&#xD;
      severe complication occurring in Covid-19 patients; (f) the increased oxygen availability in&#xD;
      lung parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOO regimen could be proposed as complimentary therapeutic treatment for Covid-19 infection,&#xD;
      without the need of any modifications of the established standard therapeutic protocols. This&#xD;
      complimentary treatment, could be helpful to (a) decrease the severity of the diseases&#xD;
      lowering the number of Covid-19 patients requiring high-intensity therapies; (b) fasten qPCR&#xD;
      negativization after disease and time-span of hospital recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigates the effectiveness of combined use of &quot;HOO&#xD;
      capsules&quot; and &quot;HOO oropharyngeal and nasal spray&quot; as a therapeutic supplement in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are moderately ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted as an open-label, prospective, controlled, multi-center randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial on 74 COVID-19 patients (both sex , aged 18-80 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the routine standard treatments for COVID-19, in the intervention group,&#xD;
      combined use of &quot;HOO capsules&quot; and &quot;HOO oropharyngeal and nasal spray&quot; will be administered 3&#xD;
      times per day and will be prescribed for 2 weeks (14 days). For the control group, the&#xD;
      placebo will be not considered and they will follow the routine standard treatments for&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is aimed at defining if HOO therapy decreases the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 (main&#xD;
      outcome). Additionally, secondary objectives will be the assessment of the temporal profile&#xD;
      of viral load, the proportion of patients with virological clearance, the hospitalization&#xD;
      duration stay, intensive care admission and time to, the COVID-19 Severity and in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
