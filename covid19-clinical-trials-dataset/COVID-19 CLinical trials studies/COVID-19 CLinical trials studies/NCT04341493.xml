    <textblock>
      Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range&#xD;
      of hosts producing diseases ranging from the common cold to serious / fatal events.&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide (NTZx) is a derivative of 5-nitrothiazole, synthesized in 1974 by Rosignol -&#xD;
      Cavier. NTZx has powerful antiviral effects through the phosphorylation of protein kinase&#xD;
      activated by double-stranded RNA, which leads to an increase in phosphorylated factor&#xD;
      2-alpha, an intracellular protein with antiviral effects. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      contrast the beneficial effect of NTZx vs NTZx plus hydroxychloroquine in patients&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) as well as against other treatments.&#xD;

      Introduction The current pandemic caused by the SARS-COV2 coronavirus (COVID-19) is&#xD;
      life-threatening and is challenging the world's best health systems. Accelerated spread of&#xD;
      this pandemia led physicians to try a variety of treatments without a well established&#xD;
      sequence due to ignorance about this new disease. The case fatality rate has been calculated&#xD;
      at 2.2% but there are differences depending on the country affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective When comparing the evolution of cases between Spain and Mexico, an apparently&#xD;
      less pronounced trend is observed in Mexico, but this may be due to underdiagnosis. In&#xD;
      calculations by the Mexican Ministry of Health, around 6% of the patients (approximately&#xD;
      10,500) who contract COVID-19 could be found serious and in need of hospitalization in&#xD;
      intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTZx NTZx and its circulating active metabolite, tizoxanide, inhibit the replication of a&#xD;
      wide range of viruses, both RNA and DNA. It has action against 16 strains of Influenza A&#xD;
      virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H3N2v, H3N8, H5N9, H7N1 and a strain of influenza B. It also works&#xD;
      against respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis&#xD;
      virus, rotavirus , hepatitis B and C, even against the human immunodeficiency virus (Severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Mexico is in Phase 2 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and more local&#xD;
      infections due to coronaviruses are expected. To date, various COVID-19 treatment schemes are&#xD;
      being tested, but the usefulness of none can be assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When reviewing the drug schemes that are being carried out in the world, it calls the&#xD;
      attention that developing countries are not included, beyond the fact that the tested&#xD;
      alternatives are economically inaccessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical survey aims to test the possible utility of NTZx against COVID-19, alone or in&#xD;
      combination with hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
