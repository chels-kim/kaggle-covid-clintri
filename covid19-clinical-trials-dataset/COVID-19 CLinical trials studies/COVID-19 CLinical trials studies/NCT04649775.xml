  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an unblinded, randomized, controlled trial for use of the AirFlO2 device for&#xD;
      patients admitted to Duke Hospital with COVID-19 and tachypnea (RR &gt;20 breaths/min) and/or&#xD;
      hypoxia (Oxygen saturation &lt;94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the use of the AirFLO2 device can improve&#xD;
      hypoxia as measured by change between partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen- P:F ratio (PaO2:FiO2) and repeat P:F ratio between 1 to 6 hours after using&#xD;
      the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an unblinded, randomized, controlled trial for use of the AirFLO2 device for patients&#xD;
      admitted to Duke Hospital with COVID-19 and tachypnea (RR &gt;20 breaths/min) and/or hypoxia&#xD;
      (Oxygen saturation &lt;94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups will be analyzed by intention to treat. Per-protocol analyses will also be performed.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be reported for the overall subject population, and for the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
