  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) of patients&#xD;
      surviving to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) and their rehabilitation and recovery process&#xD;
      from hospital to home return&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing&#xD;
      the COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 and was declared pandemic in March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases are mild, approximatively 5% of patients&#xD;
      require a stay in intensive care unit, with mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intensive care syndrome (PICS) consists of physical, cognitive and psychological&#xD;
      dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the rate and clinical presentations of PCIS among patients surviving to&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to describe the clinical manifestations of PCIS in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients, and their rehabilitation process until home return.&#xD;
