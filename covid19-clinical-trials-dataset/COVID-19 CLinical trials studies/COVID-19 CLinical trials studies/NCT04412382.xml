  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process by which neutrophils expel DNA together with various proteins to the outside,&#xD;
      forming a network structure called Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) constitutes a&#xD;
      particular cell death that involves the destruction of the nuclear membrane before the&#xD;
      plasmatic one. This process is called NETosis and differs from other known forms of cell&#xD;
      death, such as necrosis and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process, however, if exaggerated, brings local or systemic damage. Viruses are known for&#xD;
      their ability to evade the body's immune response. Only recently has it been seen that they&#xD;
      can act as triggers for NETosis process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, many viruses can stimulate neutrophils to produce NETs. Virus-induced NETs can begin&#xD;
      to circulate in an uncontrolled manner, leading to an extreme systemic response of the body&#xD;
      with the production of immunocomplexes, cytokines, Interferon I etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no data in the literature on the role of NETs in Covid-19 infection, a&#xD;
      viral infection that leads to highly lethal interstitial pneumonia and for which there is&#xD;
      currently no vaccine or specific therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced forms of Covid-19 are often characterized by hyperinflammation (&quot;cytokine storm&quot;)&#xD;
      with the development of an ARDS-like condition. Furthermore, reports of micro and macro&#xD;
      thrombotic phenomena such as microangiopathy, pulmonary embolism (which has led to a careful&#xD;
      evaluation procedure for antithrombotic prophylaxis and/or coagulation in Covid-19 patients)&#xD;
      are increasingly frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to understand if NETs can be implicated in the response&#xD;
      to Covid-19 and by which mechanisms. Concrete therapeutic proposals could derive from the&#xD;
      knowledge and enhancement of this form of innate immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, it will be necessary to evaluate the activity of NETosis in Covid-19 patients and&#xD;
      evaluate whether the clinical course of the disease (worsening vs healing) determines the&#xD;
      degree of NETosis activity. Therefore, the association between mortality from&#xD;
      Covid-19/survival and NETs activity will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives concern the possibility of studying the associations among NETosis&#xD;
      markers and blood inflammation markers and among NETosis markers and the onset of peripheral&#xD;
      or deep vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the possibility that the plasma deriving from Covid-19 patients could trigger the&#xD;
      NETosis process in vitro will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The process by which neutrophils expel DNA together with various proteins to the outside,&#xD;
      forming a network structure called Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) constitutes a&#xD;
      particular cell death that involves the destruction of the nuclear membrane before the&#xD;
      plasmatic one. This process is called NETosis and differs from other known forms of cell&#xD;
      death, such as necrosis and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophil death by NETs ejection (NETosis) was first described in 2004 by Brinkman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NETs,as indicated by the word itself, represent a sort of network composed of DNA fibers,&#xD;
      histones and proteins derived from the neutrophil granules, whose main function is to trap&#xD;
      pathogens (mainly bacteria and fungi).This process is related to the innate immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this process, if activated in an exaggerated way, implies itself local or systemic&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA expelled during this process is a double stranded DNA, a dsDNA subtype. The dsDNA,&#xD;
      which represents a fraction of the DNA available in the circulation (cell free DNA - cfDNA),&#xD;
      originates from various processes of cell death, and is therefore correlated with the degree&#xD;
      of tissue damage. It is present only in small quantities in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to underline how during the NETosis process the cellular redox state is&#xD;
      altered, leading to an excess production of oxygen free radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species,&#xD;
      ROS) and to the activation of the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The formation of NETs, and therefore&#xD;
      the process of NETosis, were initially studied in the context of bacterial infections, but&#xD;
      subsequently their role became increasingly clear in other conditions such as cancer,&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases, lung diseases, atherosclerosis and venous thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, NETosis seems to play an important role in all conditions characterized by&#xD;
      venous and arterial thrombosis, as numerous evidences have confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NETosis has also been documented at the microvascular level, such as in vasculitis,&#xD;
      thrombotic microangiopathies such as Moschowitz syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viruses are known for their ability to evade the body's immune response. Recently it has been&#xD;
      seen that they too can act as triggers of NETosis processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, many viruses can stimulate neutrophils to produce NETs. Different responses of&#xD;
      neutrophils have been seen, from classical NETosis, to the production of antiviral agents or&#xD;
      even to the switch to apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virus-induced NETs (therefore complexes of dsDNA, histones, granular proteins) can begin to&#xD;
      circulate in an uncontrolled way, leading to an extreme systemic response of the body with&#xD;
      the production of immune complexes, cytokines, Interferon I etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NETosis appears to be closely linked to the inflammatory response. For example, it is known&#xD;
      that in the neutrophilic granulocyte the PAD4 protein is present in the nucleus, it&#xD;
      decondensates the chromatin and favors the formation of the NETs. On the other hand, NETs&#xD;
      increase in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as observed in studies&#xD;
      about bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as in patients with acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      during COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore clear that virus-induced NETosis acts as a double-edged sword: if on one hand&#xD;
      there is the mechanical entrapment of the virus, on the other the inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunological reaction triggered by the release of the NETs can be harmful itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are few data in the literature on the role of NETs in Covid-19 infection, a&#xD;
      viral infection that can lead to highly lethal interstitial pneumonia and for which there is&#xD;
      no vaccine or specific therapy today. Advanced forms of Covid-19 are often characterized by&#xD;
      hyperinflammation (&quot;cytokine storm&quot;) with the development of an ARDS-like condition.&#xD;
      Furthermore, reports of micro and macro thrombotic phenomena such as microangiopathy,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (which has led to a careful evaluation procedure for antithrombotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis and / or coagulation in Covid-19 patients) are increasingly frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY The primary objective of the study is to understand if NETs can be&#xD;
      implicated in the response to Covid-19 and by which mechanisms. Concrete therapeutic&#xD;
      proposals could derive from the knowledge and enhancement of this form of innate immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, it will be necessary to evaluate the activity of NETosis in Covid-19 patients and&#xD;
      evaluate whether the clinical course of the disease (worsening vs healing) determines the&#xD;
      degree of NETosi activity. Therefore, the association between mortality from&#xD;
      Covid-19/survival and NETs activity will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives concern the possibility of studying the various associations among&#xD;
      NETosis markers and biohumoral indices of inflammation and among NETosi markers and the onset&#xD;
      of peripheral or deep vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the possibility that the plasma from Covid-19 patients could trigger the NETosis&#xD;
      process in vitro will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED PROCEDURES and COLLECTED INFORMATION Medical examination: (blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;
      and SpO2, which will allow to evaluate the precise PaO2 / FiO2 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in normal clinical practice, Covid-19 patients will undergo venous sampling for the&#xD;
      determination of blood count, creatinine, lipid profile, PCR, D-dimer, LDH, liver function&#xD;
      indices and blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precise medical history will be drawn up for each subject. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo:electrocardiogram and chest x-ray and, in selected cases, chest CT scan, depending on&#xD;
      their clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also undergo venous echo-color Doppler lower limbs examination. A complete analysis&#xD;
      of the venous axes will not be necessary. NETosis markers (Cf-DNA. MPO-DNA, Cit-H3) and the&#xD;
      cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β will be analyzed from the subjects' plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spittle sample (or bronchoalveolar fluid if necessary for diagnostic-therapeutic purposes)&#xD;
      will be collected and the detection of NETs at electron microscopy will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CALCULATION OF THE SAMPLE The sample size was defined on the basis of the number of&#xD;
      admissions for Covid-19 in the months of March-April 2020 and on the decrease in numbers in&#xD;
      the current period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 subjects (50 patients and 50 controls) are expected to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Hypothetical statistical analysis: the data will be collected through&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. The estimates will be accompanied by appropriate 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals. The level of statistical significance is set at 5%. The statistical program Stata&#xD;
      14.2 will be used. Planned test: t-test and Mann-Whitney test. Correlations will be evaluated&#xD;
      through Pearson or Spearman coefficients. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analyzes will be carried&#xD;
      out with the use of Log-Rank test and Cox regression for survival analysis.&#xD;
