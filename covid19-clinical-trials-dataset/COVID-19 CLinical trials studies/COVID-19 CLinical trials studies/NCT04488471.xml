  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus pandemic has changed healthcare dramatically in a short time. Individuals&#xD;
      with chronic illnesses and services for them have had to adapt and change to deal with&#xD;
      requirements for shielding and social isolation to reduce infection risk and management of&#xD;
      medication investigation and ongoing review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is increasingly recognised that the pandemic and the changes to daily life will have had a&#xD;
      series of impacts on patients and health care services, including impacts on patients&#xD;
      psychological well-being and the opportunity to seek medical care for non-CoViD illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety and hopelessness is well described in&#xD;
      adults and young people with inflammatory bowel disease. Quarantine has also been associated&#xD;
      with these psychological symptoms and also post-traumatic stress. It is important to identify&#xD;
      the extent of and factors that influence negative psychological consequences of isolation in&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim to assess what impact the isolation of patients during social isolation&#xD;
      had in terms of psychological well-being - and what are the factors affecting this impact,&#xD;
      particularly in younger and old age groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to understand how IBD&#xD;
      patients have been impacted psychologically by the CoViD-19 pandemic and identify various&#xD;
      factors that may affect the extent to which patients have been impacted. This study will also&#xD;
      incorporate longitudinal questionnaire follow-up of the same patients, in order to try and&#xD;
      understand the long-term impact of the pandemic, and to assess changes in psychological&#xD;
      impact accompanying changes in the national situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified from those attending the IBD clinic will be contacted. As part of the&#xD;
      NHSE and local Trust CoViD response, lists of all patients attending the IBD clinics and&#xD;
      those deemed to be at high risk of infection have been created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to recruit 100 patients from the high-risk group and 100 patients from the&#xD;
      non-high-risk group. Basedon an approximately 33% response rate, we have therefore elected to&#xD;
      identify 300 patients from the high-risk groups and 300 from non-high-risk groups. These 600&#xD;
      patients in total will be contacted via the post, and mailed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An explanatory cover letter, with instructions on how to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participant information sheet (PIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A stamped and addressed return envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of questionnaire and return to site will constitute as consent for this data to be&#xD;
      used. Postal recruitment is being used to maximise the chances of reaching those who may have&#xD;
      been most affected by isolation and may have limited access to the internet. The consent form&#xD;
      will apply to the optional interview component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PIS will include information signposting patients to help and support should they have&#xD;
      difficulties or concerns relating to the study or the psychological impact of their condition&#xD;
      or current situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record of who has been contacted to participate will be kept on NHS computers, with patient&#xD;
      hospital numbers corresponding to anonymous and non-identifiable study identification&#xD;
      numbers. Keeping record will permit there to be available data regarding the questionnaire&#xD;
      return rate. This will also potentially allow for demographic details to be retrieved from&#xD;
      patient records regarding those who did not return responses, to facilitate both assessment&#xD;
      of differences between responders and non-responders and provide information about those who&#xD;
      elected not to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a sub-set of 32 young people will be contacted and recruited. This sub-set have&#xD;
      already undertaken the assessment of psychological morbidity, outlined below, during a&#xD;
      previous, pre-CoViD outbreak study (STH20960 IRAS: 269881) and have agreed to further&#xD;
      follow-up. These patients will also be contacted via the post to complete the same set of&#xD;
      questionnaires and therefore provide follow-up, to assess whether measures of psychological&#xD;
      morbidity changed following the onset of the CoViD crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete the following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IBD symptoms: IBD control questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experience during the CoViD periods of isolation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact of event scale (iES-15 questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information, as listed below, will be collected in order to try and identify&#xD;
      demographic and disease related details which may affect the level of psychological impact&#xD;
      for IBD patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postcode (used to calculate indices of deprivation scores, using the Indices of Multiple&#xD;
           Deprivation [IMD] tool)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disease type&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. BSG risk group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same patients will be contacted and asked to complete the questionnaires again after 6&#xD;
      and 12 months to assess changes in psychological impact and relationship to societal&#xD;
      requirements for isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi structured interviews will be undertaken with approximately 20 participants. More may be&#xD;
      undertaken until saturation point is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be undertaken to provide further detail about the experience&#xD;
      of isolation during the pandemic to explore issues to include factors which improve or worsen&#xD;
      the experience of isolation including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of the isolation itself&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of variations in information provision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concern about infection risk and its variation during the period of &quot;lock-down&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delays to presentation with flare symptoms&#xD;
