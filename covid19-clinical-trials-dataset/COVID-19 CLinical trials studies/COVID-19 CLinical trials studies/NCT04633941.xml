    <textblock>
      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, weight management programs and metabolic surgery have&#xD;
      been deferred to contain the virus. Quarantine and social distancing negatively impact&#xD;
      dietary, exercise and psychological health of obese individuals. The study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of social distancing measures on post-metabolic surgery patients compare to&#xD;
      non-surgical obese patients and discuss potential strategies for management post COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Singapore, a nationwide partial lockdown, termed the &quot;circuit breaker&quot; was imposed from&#xD;
      7th April until 1st June 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Appendix A). Our study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the impact of social distancing and lockdowns during this circuit breaker&#xD;
      period on our patients with obesity, either post-metabolic surgery (MS) or undergoing active&#xD;
      medical management (MM), during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Results will help inform&#xD;
      and address the challenges in patient care that this pandemic has brought to light, its&#xD;
      long-term implications on the management of the bariatric patient and discuss potential&#xD;
      strategies for the management of a bariatric patient in a post COVID-19 society. To the&#xD;
      knowledge of this paper, this is the first study to compare the impact of COVID on MS and MM&#xD;
      patients which will allow understanding of unique stressors faced by MS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopted a cross-sectional survey design to evaluate the impact of lockdown social&#xD;
      distancing measures on obese patients in Singapore. The study conducted either face-to-face&#xD;
      questionnaires in the clinic after lockdown for those who were not suitable for video&#xD;
      consultation or questionnaires administered via telecommunication channels such as WhatsApp&#xD;
