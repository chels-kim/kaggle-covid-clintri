  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the influx of patients suspected of Covid-19 and the limited number of hospital beds,&#xD;
      there is a need for sensitive triage to detect patients at risk of pulmonary complications&#xD;
      and therefore requiring hospitalization, but also specific triage to safely discharge&#xD;
      patients without risk factors or signs of clinical or ultrasound severity. The use of&#xD;
      pulmonary ultrasound in addition to clinical assessment seems appropriate. Indeed, it allows&#xD;
      early detection of signs of pneumopathy which, in the current context, most often correspond&#xD;
      to Covid-19. These signs include B-lines, which indicate interstitial pulmonary oedema, and&#xD;
      an anfractuous and thickened pleural line, or even centimetric parenchymal condensations with&#xD;
      a low level of pleural effusion. Conversely, the presence of a medium to large pleural&#xD;
      effusion is not very suggestive of the diagnosis of Covid-19. In addition, a lung ultrasound&#xD;
      score has been developed and validated to assess the severity of acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      and predict the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is based on the&#xD;
      performance of a 12-point (6 per hemi-thorax) pulmonary ultrasound with the collection of the&#xD;
      presence of B-lines, condensation or pleural effusion. In the hands of a trained operator,&#xD;
      this examination takes only a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to develop a score based on clinical and ultrasound evidence to allow&#xD;
      early and safer referral than that based on clinical evidence alone. To do this, the study&#xD;
      will retrospectively collect clinical and lung ultrasound data from departments that use this&#xD;
      technique on a daily basis.&#xD;

      The objective of the VIRUS research is therefore to develop an innovative clinical-echo score&#xD;
      (VIRUScore), based on risk factors, clinical elements and ultrasound data. This predictive&#xD;
      score corresponds to a probabilistic measure of the individual risk of aggravation and is&#xD;
      intended to become the cornerstone of a decision-making algorithm for triaging/managing&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients (VIRUS algorithm). Initial VIRUScore and evolution of clinical and/or&#xD;
      clinico-biological signs will thus have to arbitrate different patient pathway scenarios with&#xD;
      2 major objectives: first, to reduce hospital tension and desaturate emergency departments&#xD;
      and COVID-19 units to ensure maximum monitoring of moderate forms, some of which are likely&#xD;
      to evolve towards severe forms. The negative predictive value of severe short-term&#xD;
      aggravation (H48) should therefore be maximized for these patient profiles invited to return&#xD;
      home and/or transfer to non-specialized hospitals or clinics. And secondly, it should be&#xD;
      sensitive in detecting and predicting the most severe forms with a high risk of resuscitative&#xD;
      escalation and/or death, allowing prioritization (access to CT, access to research protocols)&#xD;
      and grading the intensity of clinical surveillance, for anticipation of resuscitative&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
