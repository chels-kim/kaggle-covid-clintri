  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with increased mortality, and has been linked to a 'cytokine&#xD;
      inflammatory storm'. Populations at higher risk of COVID complications and mortality include&#xD;
      the elderly, diabetic patients and immunocompromised patients (such as HIV), and the&#xD;
      investigators have studied these 3 populations over the past 20 years and have found that&#xD;
      they all have deficiency of the endogenous antioxidant protein glutathione (GSH), elevated&#xD;
      oxidative stress, inflammation, impaired mitochondrial function, immune dysfunction, and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known and established that GSH adequacy is necessary for neutralizing harmful oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and that elevated oxidative stress appears to promote mitochondrial dysfunction. The&#xD;
      combination of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have also been linked to&#xD;
      inflammation, immune dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction. In prior studies in aging, the&#xD;
      investigators have also identified that supplementing glutathione precursor amino-acids&#xD;
      glycine and cysteine (provided as N-acetylcysteine) improves GSH deficiency and mitochondrial&#xD;
      function, and lowers oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. The&#xD;
      investigators have coined the term GlyNAC to refer to the combination of glycine and&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the prevalence and extent of these defects in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital, and the response to supplementing GlyNAC or placebo for 2-weeks.&#xD;
      Because patients with COVID-19 are also being reported to have fatigue and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, the investigators will also measure fatigue and cognition at admission, 1-week&#xD;
      and 2-weeks after beginning supplementation. The supplementation is stopped after completing&#xD;
      2-weeks, and these outcomes will be measured again after 4-weeks and 8-weeks after stopping&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate associated defects in the following two populations of patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients admitted for COVID-19 will sign an informed consent form, and be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either active (Glycine plus N-acetylcysteine) or a placebo (alanine)&#xD;
      supplementation for 2-weeks. On day-0, the participants will have a single blood draw to&#xD;
      measure measure oxidative stress, Glutathione levels, inflammatory cytokines, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, immune dysfunction, and complete questionnaires to&#xD;
      assess fatigue, activity and cognition. Additional clinical and lab information will be&#xD;
      obtained from the hospital electronic medical records. These measurements will be repeated&#xD;
      1-week and 2-weeks after starting supplementation, and at 4-weeks and 8-weeks after stopping&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
