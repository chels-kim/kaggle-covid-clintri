  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this monocentric, prospective and descriptive trial we want to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      consequences for patients treated for Covid-19. Covid patients who were hospitalized for min.&#xD;
      5 days either in a Covid-19 department or in intensive care unit will be followed-up for 8&#xD;
      weeks after hospital discharge. This is done via an innovative electronic platform in the&#xD;
      home environment (UZA@home). On the one hand the quality of life, rehabilitation and&#xD;
      reintegration of the patient will be evaluated and on the other hand the patient will be&#xD;
      screened for various psychosocial aspects such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress syndrome.&#xD;
