  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global cancer burden is estimated to have risen to 18.1 million new cases in 2018 (WHO),&#xD;
      with a trend of ongoing growth. This very frequent illness exerts tremendous physical,&#xD;
      emotional and financial strain on individuals, families, communities and health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition (under- or over-nutrition) is highly prevalent in cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy and is an important predictor of morbidity, mortality, treatment response and&#xD;
      toxicity. Alterations in taste and smell are frequently reported as side effect of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and may contribute strongly to malnutrition and to a worsen quality of life and&#xD;
      wellbeing social, emotional, and role functioning. There are evidences that chemotherapy&#xD;
      influences food liking and appetite with implications for food behaviours, including food&#xD;
      enjoyment, food preference and dietary intake. A linkage between alterations in taste and /or&#xD;
      smell and food behaviours has been reported by some studies but not all, suggesting that&#xD;
      there is a need for more research using common standardised methodologies and larger sample&#xD;
      size to gain a further insight into this topic.&#xD;
