  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People diagnosed with cancer may face many difficult decisions regarding their care and&#xD;
      preferences. This may be particularly challenging when the cancer cannot be cured. It is&#xD;
      therefore hugely important that patients have the information they need so that they can be&#xD;
      involved in these decisions and in their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This qualitative interview study aims to hear from patients who might have found that the&#xD;
      information they were given wasn't easy to understand, or who haven't been able to get&#xD;
      involved in their care as much as they would have liked. We hope to learn from these&#xD;
      experiences in order to improve the way patients are given information and supported to&#xD;
      become involved in their care.&#xD;

      Participants will be identified by healthcare professionals and invited to take part in a&#xD;
      single interview either by phone or video call, lasting around an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be semi-structured and follow a topic guide, exploring how participants have&#xD;
      been given information, how decisions have been made, and any particular challenges they may&#xD;
      have faced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will also be sought for collection of demographic and disease data from the&#xD;
      participant's medical record&#xD;
