      This study will characterize risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization, death)&#xD;
      and clinical progression of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in South Sudan and Eastern&#xD;
      Democratic Republic of the Congo.&#xD;

      A prospective cohort design will be used to follow suspected, probable, and confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases presenting for care at International Medical Corp [supported] health&#xD;
      facilities in Juba, South Sudan and the Kivus in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo&#xD;
      (DRC). This research seeks to assess risk factors for poor outcomes and characterize clinical&#xD;
      disease progression of COVID-19 cases in resource-poor humanitarian contexts in Africa.&#xD;
      Specifically, this study aims to characterize risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes,&#xD;
      including both co-morbidities with evidence from high income settings, as well as prevalent&#xD;
      conditions in humanitarian settings (e.g., acute malnutrition, malaria, HIV) for which data&#xD;
      is not yet available. This research also aims to determine how the progression of confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases in resource-poor African settings may differ from other settings where data&#xD;
      are available.&#xD;
