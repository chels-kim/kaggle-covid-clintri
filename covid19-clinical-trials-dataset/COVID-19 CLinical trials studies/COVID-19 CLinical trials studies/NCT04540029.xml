  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapidly spreading coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is a major concern worldwide and Italy is&#xD;
      at the forefront of this emergency. At the present moment, the effects on the offspring of&#xD;
      Covid-19 disease in pregnant women and/or the indirect effect of COVID-19-related prenatal&#xD;
      maternal stress are poorly understood. Epigenetic mechanisms - and especially DNA methylation&#xD;
      - are involved in the embedding of prenatal exposures to large-scale disasters into the&#xD;
      epigenome and phenotypic outcomes of the offspring. Specific target genes include SLC6A4,&#xD;
      NR3C1, OXTR, BDNF, and FKBP5. The central hypothesis of this project is that the exposure to&#xD;
      the COVID-19-related prenatal maternal stress may affect infants' outcomes from birth to 12&#xD;
      months partially through increased methylation of target genes involved in stress regulation.&#xD;
      The main goal is to investigate the association between Covid-19 disease in pregnancy or&#xD;
      COVID-19-related PMS in women pregnant during the first 9 months of the year 2020 and the&#xD;
      emotional, social, and cognitive developmental outcomes in their infants from birth to 12&#xD;
      months. Additionally, the role of target genes methylation in mediating this association will&#xD;
      be investigated. Mothers and their infants will be enrolled from the delivery units of eleven&#xD;
      neonatal facilities located in Northern Italy's COVID-19 contagion hotspot. One group will be&#xD;
      enrolled from April to October 2020 (COVID-Exposure Pregnancy, CEP), a second group will be&#xD;
      enrolled from April to October 2021 (Non-Exposure Pregnancy, NEP). Moreover, the CEP group&#xD;
      will include mothers positive or exposed to COVID-19-related MPS during different trimesters&#xD;
      of pregnancy, allowing within-group comparisons on developmentally sensitive time windows.&#xD;
      Within 48 hours from baby delivery, saliva samples will be obtained from CEP and NEP&#xD;
      newborns, immediately stored at -20Â°C and analyzed for epigenetic analyses using&#xD;
      Next-Generation Sequencing. At 3 and 6 months, mothers will be asked to fill-in validated and&#xD;
      reliable questionnaires on the emotional and social-behavioral development of their infants.&#xD;
      At 12 months, infants' stress regulation and maternal sensitivity will be evaluated through&#xD;
      video recording of mother-infant interactions. This study will provide unprecedented relevant&#xD;
      insights on the biochemical mechanisms underlying the impact of Covid-19 disease and the&#xD;
      related PMS on human offspring's developmental outcomes.&#xD;
