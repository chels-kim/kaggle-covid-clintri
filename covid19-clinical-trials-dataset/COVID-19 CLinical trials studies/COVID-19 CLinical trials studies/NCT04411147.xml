      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It infects the respiratory tract. Some&#xD;
      people who get COVID-19 have only mild symptoms. But for others, infection leads to&#xD;
      pneumonia, respiratory failure, and, in some cases, death. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about any effects that may persist after people recover from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about any long-term medical problems that people who have recovered from COVID-19&#xD;
      might have, and whether they develop an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that provides&#xD;
      protection against reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who have recovered from documented COVID-19 or were in close contact&#xD;
      with someone who had COVID-19 but did not get the infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened over 2 visits. During visit 1, they will answer questions about&#xD;
      any symptoms they are having and will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection which will involve a&#xD;
      nasal swab sample or other FDA approved test. If the test is negative, they will proceed to&#xD;
      the second visit, which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health interview (which may be recorded if the participant agrees)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test (if needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-minute walk test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires about their general and mental health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis to collect white blood cells (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into 1 of 2 groups: the COVID-19 group or the close contact group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits every 6 months for 3 years. They will repeat some of the&#xD;
      screening tests. Participants in the COVID-19 group may have visits more often if they&#xD;
      develop symptoms that suggest re-infection with SARS-CoV-2....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized viral disease primarily involving&#xD;
      the respiratory tract. The world is currently experiencing COVID-19 pandemic with a&#xD;
      significant portion of those infected developing severe disease manifestations including&#xD;
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome with respiratory failure, and, in some cases,&#xD;
      death. The clinical characteristics and spectrum of disease severity of acute COVID-19 are&#xD;
      currently being defined. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, very little is known about possible&#xD;
      clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute infection. In addition, the&#xD;
      characteristics of the initial cellular immune and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus&#xD;
      that causes COVID-19) have not been fully defined and it is not known if the immune responses&#xD;
      generated by infection provides long-term protective immunity. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to establish a longitudinal cohort that has recovered from COVID-19 and characterize the&#xD;
      clinical sequelae of acute infection, characterize the immune response to the virus, and&#xD;
      follow the evolution of the immune response over time and determine the extent to which&#xD;
      natural immunity is protective against re-infection.&#xD;

             agreeing to establish care with an outside physician or clinic for any medical&#xD;
             conditions requiring treatment that may be diagnosed as a result of protocol&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        COVID-19 Survivor Group&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documented prior COVID-19 as evidenced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in nasopharyngeal swab, sputum or other&#xD;
                  sample source with EUA/approval from the FDA; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. a positive antibody test using an assay that has received emergency use&#xD;
                  authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a history&#xD;
                  clinical manifestation compatible with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Greater than 6 weeks since onset of COVID-19 symptoms and no fever for at least 1&#xD;
             week. For individuals with asymptomatic infection, screening will not occur until at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks after the last positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        COVID-19 Close Contact&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Living in the same household as a COVID-19 survivor during the time of illness or,&#xD;
             being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period&#xD;
             of time or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g.,&#xD;
             being coughed on).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No diagnosis of COVID-19 or current symptoms suggestive of COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current abuse of alcohol or other drugs that, in the judgement of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator (PI) could interfere with patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any medical or mental health condition that, in the judgement of the PI, would make&#xD;
             the volunteer unable to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of any of the following in the past 14 days: fever &gt; 38.2 degrees Celsius; new&#xD;
             or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, dyspnea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant Women will not be enrolled in the protocol. If a woman is pregnant at the time of&#xD;
        screening she will not be enrolled until the end of her pregnancy because important&#xD;
        baseline research assessments (e.g. leukapheresis, chest x-ray, pulmonary function testing)&#xD;
        should not be done during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will not be included in this study. Due to the rarity of COVID-19 in children (as&#xD;
        of 4/11/2020 in Maryland, &lt;2% of cases occurred in children), it would not be possible to&#xD;
        recruit enough children to address the protocol research objectives. In addition, pediatric&#xD;
        restrictions for the volume of blood permitted to be drawn for research purposes and the&#xD;
        more than minimal risk of apheresis in children would severely limit the ability to conduct&#xD;
        the immunologic studies described in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Employees&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH employees may be enrolled in this study as this population meets the study entry&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a participant in the research will have&#xD;
        an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at&#xD;
        NIH.&#xD;
