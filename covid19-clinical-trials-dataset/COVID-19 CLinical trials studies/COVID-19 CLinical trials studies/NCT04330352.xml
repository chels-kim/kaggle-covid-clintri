    <textblock>
      This single-blind, randomized, controlled, trial is to assess the efficasy of a brief&#xD;
      mindfulness-based &quot;STOP touching your face&quot; training program to reduce or avoid face-touching&#xD;
      to low people's chances of catching infectious diseases like COVID-19.&#xD;

      Background Face-touching behavior often happens frequently and automatically, and poses&#xD;
      potential risk for spreading infectious disease. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have&#xD;
      shown its efficacy in the treatment of behavior disorders. This study aims to evaluate an&#xD;
      online mindfulness-based brief intervention skill named &quot;STOP (Stop, Take a Breath, Observe,&#xD;
      Proceed) touching your face&quot; in reducing face-touching behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a single-blind, randomized, controlled, trial. We will recruit 1,000&#xD;
      participants, and will randomize and allocate participants 1:1 to the &quot;STOP touching your&#xD;
      face&quot; intervention group (n=500) and the control group (n=500). All participants will be&#xD;
      asked to monitor and record their face-touching behavior. The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      the brief online mindfulness-based &quot;STOP touching your face&quot; program, and the control group&#xD;
      will receive control intervention. Primary outcome will be the efficacy of short-term&#xD;
      mindfulness-based &quot;STOP touching your face&quot; intervention for reducing the frequency of&#xD;
      face-touching. The secondary outcomes will be the reduction of the duration of face-touching&#xD;
      after intervention; the correlation between the psychological traits of mindfulness and&#xD;
      face-touching behavior; and the differences of face-touching behavior between left-handers&#xD;
      and right-handers. We will recruit 1000 participants from April to June 2020 or until the&#xD;
      recruitment process is complete. The follow-up will be completed in June 2020. We expect all&#xD;
      trial results to be available by the end of June 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion This is the first RCT to evaluate the efficacy of brief mindfulness intervention&#xD;
      to reduce face-touching behavior. We expect that &quot;STOP touching your face&quot; has a&#xD;
      significantly greater reduction the frequency of face-touching behavior than the control&#xD;
      intervention. As &quot;STOP touching your face&quot; is a brief and simple skill, the public health&#xD;
      impact of its expansion world-wide could be enormous, helping us to manage any face-touching&#xD;
      spread infectious diseases, like Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

    <description>This will be calculated as the percentage of participants touching their faces (including any of the following areas: the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, cheeks, chin, neck, forehead, hair) during a 60-minute period before the intervention minus the percentage of participants touching their faces after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the correlation between the psychological traits of mindfulness (measured by FFMQ) and face-touching behavior. The self-report scale of FFMQ is currently the most frequently used mindfulness questionnaire to measure changes in participant's tendency to be mindful in daily life by the following five related facets: observing(noticing, attending to sensations, perceptions, thoughts, feelings; 8 items), describing (labeling feelings, thoughts with words), acting with awareness (automatic pilot, concentration, non-distraction), non-judging internal experience, and non-reactivity to internal experience. Participants will be asked to what extent each of the statements are true of them. Each item is on a 1 to 5 Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The factor structure of the short version (FFMQ-15) will be used in this study, which has been consistent with that of the FFMQ-39.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the differences of face-touching behavior between left-handers and right-handers. EHI is the most widely used 10-item self-report inventory to assess handedness. It is comprised of the following 10 activities: (1) writing, (2) drawing, (3) throwing, (4) using scissors, (5) a toothbrush (6) knife (without fork), (7) spoon, and such activities involving both hands as (8) using a broom (upper hand), (9) striking a match, and (10) unscrewing the lid of a bottle. To complete the EHI, one or two check marks are placed under &quot;left (L)&quot; or &quot;right (R)&quot; columns, indicating strength of preference for each activity. Participants will be asked write &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; in the appropriate corresponding column. If the preference is very strong that they would never try to use the other hand unless absolutely forced to, then they will mark this column as &quot;2&quot; and the other column as &quot;0&quot;. If they are really indifferent, they will mark it as &quot;1&quot; in both columns.</description>

    <description>Eligibility participants who are allocated to the intervention group will be required to find a time to monitor and record their behavior of hand-to-face contacts, including the frequency and length (in second) of face-touching in any of the mucosal area (eyes, nose, mouth) and nonmucosal area (ears, cheeks, chin, neck, forehead, hair) during a 60-minute period. Then, they will receive the online mindfulness-based &quot;STOP touching your face&quot; program. Each participant will be required to practice this technique until they feel confident and natural. The systematic review showed the efficacy of single session of brief MBIs, the average length was 15 minutes, ranged from less than 5 to 25 min. Thus, the requirement practice time will be at least 15 minutes (excluding the time of reading the text and the first time of listening to the audio). Later (at least 1-hour interval), they will be asked to self-monitor and report their one-hour face-touching behavior again.</description>

    <description>1. Remind yourself to STOP. Whatever you are doing in this moment (e.g. touching your month, pinching your nose, rubbing your eyes, resting your chin on your hands), pause for a minute. 2. Take a deep breath. This reconnects you with your body. Pay attention to your breathing and just allow yourself to continue to breathe normally and naturally. 3. Observe what is happening for you in this moment-including thoughts, feelings, and emotions (e.g. feel distracted, anxious or nervous?). What do you notice in your body (e.g. feel itchy or tingling on any part of your face)? You can be aware of anything: posture, sensations, tension in your body, or, once again, your breath. You might notice the sound around you. You might even notice your thoughts or emotions. 4. Proceed with whatever you were doing before you came to a STOP or something that you want to do in the moment (e.g. proceed with touching your face, or stop face-touching and take an alternative behavior).</description>
