      respiratory illness caused by Coronavirus 2019 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 subjects will be randomized 2:1 in this study. 40 patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive daily oral doses of 30 ml of Viusid and 10 ml of Asbrip every 8 hours and standard&#xD;
      care. Other 20 patients will be assigned to receive only standard care.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical Improvement as assessed by change in total symptom score ranging from 0-12.&#xD;
The symptom score includes: [everyday assessment, up to 21 days].&#xD;
Fever (temperature in oC) based on a scale 0-3: 0 &lt;36,7; 1 =36,7-37,8; 2 =37,8-38,9; 3 &gt; 38,9.&#xD;
Cough on a scale 0-3: 0 = no cough, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.&#xD;
