      A Phase I/II, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, individually randomized trial to assess&#xD;
      safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine&#xD;
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in adults aged 18-65 years living with and without HIV in South Africa. The&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo will be administered via an intramuscular injection into the deltoid&#xD;
      muscle of the non-dominant arm.&#xD;

      A total of 2070 participants will be enrolled into the trial; 1970 HIV-uninfected and 100&#xD;
      people living with HIV. There will be 4 trial groups, group 1 (n=50; intensive safety &amp;&#xD;
      immunogenicity cohort, HIV negative), group 2a (n=250; safety, intense immunogenicity &amp;&#xD;
      efficacy), group 2b (n=1650; safety, immunogenicity &amp; vaccine efficacy) and group 3 (n=100,&#xD;
      intensive safety &amp; immunogenicity cohort, HIV positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up for 12 months after enrollment.&#xD;
