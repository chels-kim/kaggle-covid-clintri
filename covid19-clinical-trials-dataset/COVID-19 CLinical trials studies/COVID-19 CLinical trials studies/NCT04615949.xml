    <textblock>
      Non-critical patients, hospitalized within the previous 24 hours who tested positive for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and have a prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or significant risk&#xD;
      factors for CVD will be treated for 28 days.&#xD;

      Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. 1:1&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (Day 0-1): Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 within the past 24 hours will be&#xD;
      screened. If patient consent can be obtained, baseline assessments will be carried out:&#xD;
      Physical examination (including vital signs), ECG including QTc interval assessment,&#xD;
      echocardiogram to measure left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), chest X-ray, local&#xD;
      laboratory (including CBC, AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine/eGFR, INR,&#xD;
      pregnancy test (in women with child-bearing potential only), lymphocyte count and LDH. A&#xD;
      C-SSRS will also be completed. Frozen plasma will be retained for central analysis of&#xD;
      CardiolRx™ levels, hs-troponin, NT-proBNP, D-dimer as well as inflammatory markers (hs-CRP,&#xD;
      ferritin, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If all eligibility criteria are met, the patient will be randomized to either CardiolRx™ or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be initiated immediately after all baseline assessments have been&#xD;
      completed and the patient is randomized (Day1). Oral administration is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 and Day 2: Initial dose: 2.5 mg/kg of body weight b.i.d. with food: CardiolRx™ or&#xD;
           placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 and Day 4: Increased to 5 mg/kg of body weight b.i.d. with food: CardiolRx™ or&#xD;
           placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5 to Day 28: Increased to 7.5 mg/kg of body weight b.i.d. with food: CardiolRx™ or&#xD;
           placebo For the first 7 days and on Day 10, an ECG will be recorded 4 hours post morning&#xD;
           dose with QTc intervals measured. If the QTc interval is &gt;500 msec or an increase of &gt;&#xD;
           60 msec from baseline is observed, the study medication must be stopped immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the next higher dose is not tolerated for other reasons, the dose will be reduced to the&#xD;
      previous tolerated dose. The highest tolerated dose will be administered until Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the assessments up to Day 10 will be carried out&#xD;
      as home visits. After Day 10, all remaining scheduled assessments will be carried out during&#xD;
      out-patient visits (or home visits, if out-patient visits are not feasible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to prolongation of the QTc intervals, careful observation is required to detect&#xD;
      other Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs). Because CardiolRx™,&#xD;
      may inhibit the metabolism of other drugs, new symptoms may represent toxicity from a&#xD;
      concomitant medication that had previously been well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasopharyngeal swab will also be done every day until Day 7 and on Day 14 to test for&#xD;
      presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Day 7, assessments will be carried out on a weekly basis except for as noted above on&#xD;
      Day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen plasma will be retained for central analysis of CardiolRx™ levels, hs-troponin,&#xD;
      NT-proBNP, D-dimer, inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, ferritin, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10) and additional parameters of interest every two days until Day 7 as well as on day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments on Day 28 include the following: Physical examination (including vital&#xD;
      signs), ECG (recorded 4 hours post morning dose for measurement of QTc interval),&#xD;
      echocardiogram to measure LVEF, chest X-ray, local laboratory assessments, including CBC,&#xD;
      AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine/eGFR, INR, lymphocyte count and LDH. In&#xD;
      addition, a C-SSRS will be completed and the patient will be asked to answer a PICQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further follow-up visits are scheduled for Day 45 and Day 60 post randomization. These&#xD;
      include a clinical assessment (including vital signs) as well as the completion of the PICQ&#xD;
      (PICQ on Day 60 only). Any changes in concomitant medications and (S)AEs will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
