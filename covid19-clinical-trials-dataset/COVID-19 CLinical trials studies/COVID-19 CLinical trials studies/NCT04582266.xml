  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and safety of&#xD;
      remdesivir (GS-5734TM) (RDV) administered to pregnant and non-pregnant women with COVID-19.&#xD;
      It is a Phase I, prospective, open label, non-randomized opportunistic PK study in pregnant&#xD;
      and non-pregnant women of childbearing potential hospitalized and receiving RDV for treatment&#xD;
      of COVID-19. RDV will not be provided as part of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I prospective, open label, non-randomized opportunistic study to evaluate the&#xD;
      PK and safety of RDV when administered to pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential for treatment of COVID-19. RDV is not provided as part of this study; a requirement&#xD;
      for entry is that participants receive RDV as part of their clinical care (i.e., outside of&#xD;
      the study). A target of 20 PK evaluable pregnant women will be enrolled into Arm 1; a target&#xD;
      of 20 PK evaluable non-pregnant women of childbearing potential will be enrolled into Arm 2.&#xD;
      Study sites will be located in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be pregnant and non-pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 and will&#xD;
      receive daily RDV infusions, typically for 5 days but in some cases for up to 10 days, as&#xD;
      part of their clinical care. RDV will be provided and managed by the participants' treating&#xD;
      physician and will not be provided as a part of this study. Participants will undergo&#xD;
      intensive PK sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all women, clinical and laboratory evaluations will be abstracted from the medical&#xD;
      record. Pregnancy, birth, and infant outcomes will be obtained from pregnant women enrolled&#xD;
      in Arm 1. Women will be followed for safety through 4 weeks after the last infusion; Arm 1&#xD;
      women who are still pregnant at that time will also be followed for safety at delivery.&#xD;
