      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is an infection caused by a coronavirus. It can affect different parts of the body.&#xD;
      For most people, it causes fevers or trouble breathing. Some people can have symptoms long&#xD;
      after they recover. Researchers want to learn if there are signs of changes in the nervous&#xD;
      system that may be related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the nervous system (the brain and nerves) in people who have had COVID-19 yet still&#xD;
      have certain symptoms even after recovering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who had COVID-19 and still have neurologic symptoms after they&#xD;
      recovered from the initial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a neurological exam. They will complete pen-and-paper tests of their&#xD;
      memory and thinking. They will complete a smell test with 'scratch-and-sniff' booklets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Soft padding or a coil&#xD;
      will be placed around their head. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of the MRI&#xD;
      scanner. They will get a contrast dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants blood pressure, blood flow, skin temperature, sweating, and breathing will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an electrocardiogram to measure heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will blow into a mouthpiece for several seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a table that has a motor. The motor tilts the table. Participants&#xD;
      will have blood drawn through an IV as the table tilts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a lumbar puncture. A small needle will be inserted into the spinal&#xD;
      canal to obtain fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may repeat some tests 8 weeks to 1 year later.&#xD;

      Study Description: This study will characterize ongoing neurologic abnormalities in those who&#xD;
      recovered from acute COVID-19 infection yet have persistent neurologic symptoms. Despite&#xD;
      clinical recovery from the acute infection, some individuals continue to experience ongoing&#xD;
      symptoms, at times several months after recovery, and many of these symptoms are neurologic.&#xD;
      The NIH Clinical Center provides the breadth of expertise and resources to best investigate&#xD;
      this patient group. This study will collect a broad array of specialized neurologic testing&#xD;
      in this group who, despite recovering from the acute SARSCoV-2 infection, continue to&#xD;
      experience neurological symptoms. It is hypothesized that this group will have abnormalities&#xD;
      on neurologic testing that may identify discrete phenotypes of COVID-19 sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening for this study will be done under the study, 'Post-Coronavirus Disease 19&#xD;
      Syndrome at the National Institutes of Health.' Potentially eligible participants will be&#xD;
      identified under the screening arm of that study and will be referred to the study team. If&#xD;
      deemed eligible for this study based on a review of available records and a telephone&#xD;
      discussion with the potential participant, participants may enroll. Enrollment will include a&#xD;
      visit to the NIH Clinical Center for informed consent and completion of the study procedures.&#xD;
      We anticipate that the baseline study procedures will take approximately 2-3 outpatient&#xD;
      visits to complete or the participant may be admitted as an inpatient. Participants may&#xD;
      return for a repeat of some study procedures within 12 months if there are abnormalities&#xD;
      noted on the baseline study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To investigate structural abnormalities by brain MRI in those with prior&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent neurologic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To investigate other components of neurologic function in those with&#xD;
      prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent neurologic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary endpoint: The number and character of brain MRI abnormalities on a&#xD;
      dedicated research MRI protocol optimized to detect COVID-19-associated disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: 1. Neurologic examination: The number and character of abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with both central and peripheral nervous system disease. 2. Autonomic testing: The&#xD;
      number and character of test results indicating autonomic nervous system or catecholaminergic&#xD;
      dysfunctions as evidenced by abnormal physiological and neurochemical measures at rest or in&#xD;
      responses to the Valsalva maneuver or head-up tilting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: This study will enroll 50 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The NIH Clinical Center will be the&#xD;
      site of all research studies done under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: We anticipate that this study will begin enrollment September 2020 and will&#xD;
      complete data analysis by December 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Participants will complete all required study procedures within an&#xD;
      approximately two-week time frame. Participants may return for optional follow up with a&#xD;
      repeat of some study procedures and those participants will complete the study at that point.&#xD;
