      Rationale : The emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens&#xD;
      public health. To date, there are no effective drug option to prevent the infection, nor&#xD;
      therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. However, the majority of patients infected&#xD;
      with SARS-Cov-2 eliminate the virus by mounting a protective antiviral immune response,&#xD;
      associated in particular with the production of neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies could be of particular interest for therapeutic purposes, but also for preventive&#xD;
      applications, to protect people who have never been in contact with the virus, or&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate human monoclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-Cov-2 from immortalized B&#xD;
           cells of convalescent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the serological profiles between convalescent patients that develop mild or&#xD;
           uncomplicated illness and convalescent patients that develop a more severe disease, that&#xD;
           required hospitalization and oxygen support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare for each patient the neutralizing efficiency of plasma to the neutralizing&#xD;
           capacities of the monoclonal antibodies generated with immortalized B cells.&#xD;

        This study relates to 10 adult subjects who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 (positivity&#xD;
        confirmed by PCR test), who were symptomatic, and who were in the recovery phase when the&#xD;
        blood sample was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Among the 10 convalescent subjects who will be sampled, we will select two distinct&#xD;
        populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (i) five convalescent patients (minimum 12 days after the onset of symptoms), diagnosed&#xD;
        COVID + on the temporary sampling platform which was set up at HCL at the start of the&#xD;
        epidemic, which notably concerns symptomatic healthcare professionals for whom&#xD;
        hospitalization was not required; (ii) five convalescent patients (minimum 12 days after&#xD;
        the onset of symptoms), hospitalized in the infectious diseases department of the&#xD;
        Croix-Rousse hospital living in the metropolitan area of Lyon, having presented hypoxemic&#xD;
        pneumonia requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
