    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the impact of pandemic and nonconfinement related to&#xD;
      anxiety and eventual immune diseases with several standardized questionnaires : Implant&#xD;
      Stability Quotient (ISQ) , Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire -9 (PHQ-9), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder-8 (PTSD-8), and Experiences in Close&#xD;
      Relationship Scale (ECRS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic and prevention strategise have strongly impacted family lives, social&#xD;
      lives, professional lives, and income; resulting in increased reporting of stress and anxiety&#xD;
      within patients. This risk of infection 'post-confinement' is an additional source of stress&#xD;
      for people returning to their professional and social lives. There are evidence showing a&#xD;
      relationship between stress, immunity and the prognosis of several infections and&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic and prevention strategise have strongly impacted family lives and&#xD;
      induced a high level of anxiety and other types of stress. This risk of infection&#xD;
      'post-confinement' is an additional source of stress for people returning to their&#xD;
      professional and social life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are evidences showing a relationship between stress, immunity and the prognosis of&#xD;
      several infections and inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to launch an online survey that measures population stress felt&#xD;
      during the pandemic and post-confinement time and possible effects on eventual immune&#xD;
      mediated disorders (allergies, auto-immunity..) through the report of new events or flares.&#xD;
      The stress will first be measured on standardized anxiety GAD-7scale but also on more&#xD;
      parameters (ISQ, PHQ-9, PTSD-8, and ECR-S). Socio-economic and environmental parameters will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of anxiety and other stress parameters as well as occurrence of inflammatory events&#xD;
      will be measured according to the calendar and confinement /post confinement timing. Risk&#xD;
      factors will be looked for, by multi parametric data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey has been built in a user-friendly, accessible way so the investigators can expect&#xD;
      a high number of participants (at least 400), especially as people are highly concerned by&#xD;
      the situation and will be motivated to take part.&#xD;
