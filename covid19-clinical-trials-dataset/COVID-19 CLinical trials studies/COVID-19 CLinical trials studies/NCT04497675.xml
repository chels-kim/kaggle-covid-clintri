    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the transmission of&#xD;
      respiratory diseases and the correct wearing of masks, as well as the factors affecting the&#xD;
      correct wearing of masks. The research is beneficial to the prevention of respiratory&#xD;
      diseases and moves the barrier of prevention and control forward. It is of great significance&#xD;
      to COVID-19 's practical prevention and control.&#xD;

      1. Overall design：This study uses the methods of cross-sectional survey and chance&#xD;
           sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sign the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigation on the basic situation of personnel: The gender, age and education level&#xD;
           of the subjects were analyzed as the factors influencing whether the mask was worn&#xD;
           correctly or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigation on the types of wearing masks： 1) The types of masks worn by the subjects&#xD;
           were recorded as the basis of stratified statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Mask suitability testing：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual inspection whether the mask is close to the face with obvious gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breathing test Are there any obvious gaps or whether the cotton around the mask is blown&#xD;
           when the subject taking a deep breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Spray test The FT-30 qualitative fitness test system of 3M company was used to test the&#xD;
           suitability and correctness of wearing mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the spray test, all subjects underwent a sensitivity test to prove their ability to smell&#xD;
      the bitterness of the reagent, sensitive subjects can participate in the direct spray test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to objectively reflect the overall situation of the subjects, it is necessary to&#xD;
      cover many ages and educational levels of men and women.&#xD;

    <description>Whenever the subject feels bitter, it means that the mask does not fit well with the subject's face.&#xD;
If the subjects do not feel bitter all the time, it means that the mask is suitable for the subjects' face and can be worn.</description>

    <description>The subject wears a mask and his/her tongue sticks out properly. The suitability test reagent is used to spray directly to the subject from the top, bottom, left side and right side twice respectively, and the subject can stop the spray as soon as he/she smells bitterness.&#xD;
Record whether the subject feels bitterness, if not, let the subject puts on the hood, carry out the fitness test again and record the results.</description>

If the subject feels bitterness, stick the adhesive strip on the upper edge of the subject's mask and perform the direct spray test again. Record whether the subject feels bitterness, if not, ask the subject to put on the hood, carry out the fitness test again and record it. If there is a feeling, ask the subject to change to a medical surgical mask and put an adhesive strip on the upper edge of the mask, then conduct the direct spray test again, and record the test results.</description>
