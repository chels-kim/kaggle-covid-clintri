    <textblock>
      This study tests the randomized re-opening of training facilities in Norway in relation to&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators will use the recently developed concept of&#xD;
      rapid-cycle randomized implementation to assure fast and safe re-introduction of training&#xD;
      facilities by randomized testing of access restriction and measure virus exposure and&#xD;
      immunity as well as clinical disease during the intervention to enable safe and timely&#xD;
      downgrading of COVID-19 restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of training facilities in Norway age 18 to 64 years without COVID-19 related&#xD;
      comorbidity will after informed consent be randomised to either access to training or no&#xD;
      access in a first 2-week cycle. Testing for COVID-19 and ascertainment of clinical disease&#xD;
      will be performed after the first cycle. If there is no clinically meaningful difference&#xD;
      between the arms, new cycles may be implemented subsequently, e.g. with less distancing&#xD;
      restrictions or wider age groups.&#xD;
