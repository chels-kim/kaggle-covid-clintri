  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness training has been gaining popularity in the past decade as a means of improving&#xD;
      general well-being. This trend appears in response to the new stressors that have arisen with&#xD;
      the increased stress of the 21st century. Studies have shown that the psychological state of&#xD;
      metacognitive awareness encapsulated in mindfulness can promote the decreasing of stress as&#xD;
      well as the secondary effect of improving sleep quality; both outcome measures of this study.&#xD;
      While the body of research evaluating these benefits is growing, there is limited emphasis&#xD;
      placed on the individual differences that can affect the overall efficacy of mindfulness&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim in this study is to observe the effects of mindfulness training on perceived stress&#xD;
      levels as well as on sleep using subjective measures in a large sample of trainees. To&#xD;
      achieve this, participants will be recruited from a pool of people who have signed up for a&#xD;
      4-week foundational mindfulness or 8-week mindfulness based stress reduction course at Brahm&#xD;
      Centre. Questionnaires will be administered both before and after these courses to evaluate&#xD;
      both stress levels and sleep habits as well as other factors which could contribute to the&#xD;
      efficacy of mindfulness training. These inventories will probe the different facets of&#xD;
      interpersonal differences that could serve to influence the effectiveness of the mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention. In addition, the investigators will also test the effect of conducting the&#xD;
      course online during a situation of emergency, like it is the partial lockdown that was&#xD;
      implemented in Singapore due to the spread of Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has the potential to provide new insights into the factors that affect the&#xD;
      efficacy of mindfulness on stress and sleep, in a situation of non-emergency (until February&#xD;
      the 6th 2020) as well as during a period of heightened restrictions (DORSCON Orange, from 7th&#xD;
      of February to 6th of April 2020) and a partial lockdown (from 7th of April to 1st of June&#xD;
      2020, or until resume of normal activity). Further, the investigators hope to build an&#xD;
      algorithm that can predict the potential effectiveness of mindfulness on a person by person&#xD;
      basis. This could serve as a foundation for future recommendations for mindfulness training&#xD;
      as well as open the door for future studies that could serve to further customize the&#xD;
      mindfulness training framework to accommodate individual differences&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health and well-being are increasingly being emphasized in modern society. In response,&#xD;
      mindfulness-based training (MBT) (e.g. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)&#xD;
      (Kabat-Zinn,1990)) is slowly gaining popularity as a method to alleviate the stress of modern&#xD;
      day living. MBT involves bringing one's attention to the present moment, stopping one's&#xD;
      thoughts from drifting into concerns about the past or the future It has significant effects&#xD;
      on improving mental health via reducing symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression (Fjorback,&#xD;
      Arendt, Ørnbøl, Fink &amp; Walach, 2019). Local studies have similarly demonstrated the efficacy&#xD;
      of mindful training in stress reduction for mental health professionals in Singapore (Suyi,&#xD;
      Meredith &amp; Khan, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing stress and improving metacognitive processes also contributes to better emotional&#xD;
      regulation, thus facilitating better sleep quality (Chiesa et al., 2011; Zeidan et al.,&#xD;
      2010).. By breaking up cycles of rumination and worry, mindfulness is hypothesized to reduce&#xD;
      &quot;verbal overregulation&quot; and facilitate the disengagement necessary to fall asleep (Gross et&#xD;
      al., 2011). Mindfulness programs have been found to improve sleep quality in both healthy&#xD;
      individuals (Lazar et al., 2000) and patients with medical or psychiatric illness, including&#xD;
      insomnia and depression (Carlson &amp; Garland, 2005; Heidenreich et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is much documentation supporting the efficacy of mindfulness training on stress&#xD;
      and sleep, there is little research that attempts to evaluate the interpersonal differences&#xD;
      or factors that predict the efficacy of mindfulness training on sleep and stress. Isolating&#xD;
      these predictive variables consequently allows a better way to evaluate suitability of the&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention on an individual basis; maximizing the results for the individual.&#xD;
      With this new information, individuals suffering from stress and bad sleep would be able to&#xD;
      better be able to select the most effective intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the concepts above have often been explored in relation to mindfulness, no studies to&#xD;
      date have used machine learning to assess how these variables predispose an individual to&#xD;
      benefit from mindfulness training. Generating this algorithm will allow for the prediction of&#xD;
      treatment response in future trainees. Further, a better understanding of the effect of&#xD;
      individual differences on efficacy can open the door for future research to examine how and&#xD;
      why these differing results exist and incorporate this information to increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of mindfulness training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants signing up for the 4 or 8 weeks mindfulness training courses at the Brahm Centre&#xD;
      and run by Potential Project (two external organization providing Mindfulness based courses)&#xD;
      will be automatically sent a link to the questionnaire packet several days after course&#xD;
      enrolment. Participants will be provided with a survey link in the enrolment email that is&#xD;
      sent to participants to confirm their enrolment, separate recruitment e-mails will not be&#xD;
      sent out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that the data will form part of a research study, that any&#xD;
      information provided is anonymous, and that they can opt out of completing the questionnaires&#xD;
      without any penalty to their class enrolment. Recruitment emails will not be sent out. On&#xD;
      enrollment in any of the courses, participants will be informed that there is an option to&#xD;
      take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff sending out emails will be separate from staff carrying out the mindfulness training&#xD;
      programs. This will ensure that there will be no scenario where a dependent relationship will&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can decide if they prefer to sign up for the 4 weeks or 8 weeks Mindfulness&#xD;
      courses, depending on availability at the Mindfulness centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered through the platform SurveyMonkey ©. SSL encryption will&#xD;
      be used to protect sensitive data as it is relayed between the respondent's computer and&#xD;
      SurveyMonkey© servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered twice, with the predictor surveys administered at&#xD;
      pre-intervention only, and outcome variables collected both pre- and post-intervention (PSQI&#xD;
      and PSAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive factors 10 predictive factors were chosen to evaluate their predictive qualities&#xD;
      on the effectiveness of mindfulness training in reducing stress and improving sleep:&#xD;
      Personality: Mindfulness training has been shown to be more effective in students with higher&#xD;
      scores in conscientiousness and neuroticism (Winning &amp; Boag, 2015). As such, the NEO-FFI-3&#xD;
      will be used to measure the dimensions of personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trait Mindfulness: Baseline trait mindfulness has been shown to be a significant moderator of&#xD;
      MBSR intervention effects (Shapiro, Brown, Thoresen, &amp; Plante, 2010). The investigators have&#xD;
      included trait mindfulness to corroborate previous studies that have shown this relationship&#xD;
      as well as to explore its effect within a local population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood and depression: While depression and mood has been often measured in conjunction with&#xD;
      Mindfulness training, there has been little to no research on how it relates to mindfulness&#xD;
      training efficacy State-Trait Anxiety: Mindfulness has been shown to alleviate state trait&#xD;
      anxiety in individuals (Bergen-Cico &amp; Cheon, 2013). The investigators are thus interested in&#xD;
      whether a higher or lower baseline score in the STAI will affect the efficacy of mindfulness&#xD;
      training Empathy: There are mixed results in regards to the relationship between empathy and&#xD;
      mindfulness; with some studies finding no significant connection (Bergen-Cico &amp; Cheon, 2013),&#xD;
      and others showing differing effectiveness dependent on personality traits (Winning &amp; Boag,&#xD;
      2015; Ridderinkhof, de Bruin, Brummelman, &amp; Bögels, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-compassion: Self compassion is believed to be developed and enhanced through mindfulness&#xD;
      training. Birnie, Speca &amp; Carlson (2010) found strong associations between self-compassion&#xD;
      and mindfulness. It was found that changes in self-compassion were predictive of changes in&#xD;
      mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning styles: This was included to investigate whether the difference in learning styles&#xD;
      in individuals would affect the ways in which the mindfulness training are internalized; in&#xD;
      turn influencing the efficacy of mindfulness training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectancy/Credibility: Expectancy has been shown to be predictive in evaluating the outcome&#xD;
      on some measures (Devilly &amp; Borkovec, 2000). It would be beneficial to understand its effect&#xD;
      on the effectiveness of mindfulness training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional Regulation: Emotion regulation has been shown to improve with mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions (Guendelman, Medeiros &amp; Rampes, 2017). The investigators are interested in&#xD;
      understanding the effect of emotional regulation on mindfulness training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping Methods: Mindfulness has been shown to affect the coping strategies used in&#xD;
      individuals. The effect of coping methods on mindfulness training efficacy is thus of&#xD;
      interest to our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck &amp; Mermelstein,1983)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has four objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To corroborate findings on the effect of mindfulness training on perceived stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: based on previous literature, the investigators predict that mindfulness&#xD;
      interventions will decrease perceived stress, with lower PSS score post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether individual differences might be predictive of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mindfulness training on stress Hypothesis: through the use of machine learning, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to create a model that can predict changes in perceived Stress (PSS) post&#xD;
      intervention based on individual predictors as defined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether individual differences might be predictive of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mindfulness training on sleep Hypothesis: through the use of machine learning, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to create a model that can predict changes in Sleep quality (PSQI) post&#xD;
      intervention based on individual predictors as defined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the effects of group mindfulness interventions on stress and sleep quality during a&#xD;
      period of global uncertainty, a partial lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to&#xD;
      Mindfulness intervention in a non-emergency situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (i):the investigator predict that participants would report higher levels of&#xD;
      perceived stress and poorer sleep quality at baseline during the period of the pandemic&#xD;
      (DORSCON Orange and lockdown) relative to an earlier control period; Hypothesis (ii): the&#xD;
      investigators predict that online mindfulness training (during lockdown) would have be&#xD;
      non-inferior/equivalent in reducing perceived stress and improving sleep quality compared&#xD;
      with DORSCON Orange and the control period.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective measures of Sleep quality: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score (PSQI) is a 19-item self-rated questionnaire for evaluating subjective sleep quality over the previous month. The PSQI has a sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% for identifying cases with sleep disorder, using a cut-off score of 5. The first 4 items are open questions, whereas items 5 to 19 are rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Individual items scores yield 7 components. A total score, ranging from 0 to 21, is obtained by adding the 7 component scores. A score above 5 suggests poor sleep quality. A decrease in PSQI score following intervention would reflect and improvement of sleep quality</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective measures of Stress: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS measures whether different aspects of life were perceived as stressful by participants on a 5-point scale (where 0 was never and 4 was very often) in the past month. Positively worded questions are reversed scored and all 10 questions ratings are summarised into a total score, which ranges from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating more perceived stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective Time in Bed (TIB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured within the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. This is the total perceived time in bed in minutes, calculated as item 3 of the PSQI (&quot;When have you usually gotten up in the morning?&quot;) minus item 1 (&quot;When have you usually gone to bed?&quot;)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective Total Sleep Time (TST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured within the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Total sleep time reflects the amount of time in minutes participants were effectively sleeping while in bed, without periods of wakefulness, on average over the past month. This will be measured by item 4 of the PSQI questionnaires: &quot;How many hours of actual sleep do you get at night?&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured within the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. This is the perceived time, in minutes, that takes participants to fall asleep from the moment they go to bed. This corresponds to item 2 of the PSQI: &quot;How long (in minutes) has it taken you to fall asleep each night?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured within the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. In addition to Sleep Onset Latency (Secondary outcome 1), a second subjective measure of sleep quality is extracted from the PSQI: time of perceived wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset. WASO is calculated by taking into account the total time spent in bed (TST) minus total sleep time (TST) and minus sleep onset latency (SOL), in minutes. High WASO scores reflect low sleep continuity and poor sleep quality.</description>
