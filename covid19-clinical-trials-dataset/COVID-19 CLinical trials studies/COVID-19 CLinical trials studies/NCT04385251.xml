  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study is to estimate the rate of disease progression for adults&#xD;
      testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint for this study and the basis for sample&#xD;
      size is hospitalization or death during the 28 day follow-up period. In some locations&#xD;
      special facilities are being built/utilized for quarantine/public health reasons for those&#xD;
      who are SARS-CoV-2 positive. Hospitalization is defined as a stay for at least 18 hours,&#xD;
      irrespective of reason, at a hospital or one of these special facilities after study&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include participant-reported health status and change in severity of&#xD;
      dyspnoea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019 causing a novel Corona-Virus&#xD;
      Induced Disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. While a&#xD;
      proportion of people with COVID-19 have sufficiently severe symptoms to require&#xD;
      hospitalization at the time of initial symptom onset, in others the disease may remain mild,&#xD;
      and in some cases there has been observed a worsening of symptoms a few days after initial&#xD;
      presentation with relatively mild symptoms. There is an urgent need for understanding the&#xD;
      progression of disease for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 who do not require&#xD;
      immediate hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an international, observational cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection/COVID-19 managed as outpatients (not hospitalized). This study will also be a&#xD;
      platform for the enrollment of outpatients for randomized trials that will be conducted by&#xD;
      the INSIGHT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will form an observational cohort study and be&#xD;
      followed for 28 days. Procedures and data collection have been streamlined to facilitate the&#xD;
      enrollment of a large number of adults at INSIGHT sites around the world.&#xD;
