      CASE SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 cases of COVID-19 samples proved to be positive in Ain Shams University Specialized&#xD;
      Hospital labs (at the Universities reference lab) will be tested in the strain study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of virus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal &amp; oropharyngeal swabs will be taken from suspected cases and put in a specific&#xD;
      viral transpot media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One oropharyngeal swab (OS) and one nasopharyngeal swab (NS) are collected from hospitalized&#xD;
      SARI patients (adults and pediatric) and then added together in one 15ml Falcon tube&#xD;
      containing 2ml viral transport media (VTM). The swabs are obtained by a well-trained doctor&#xD;
      or medical professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal swabbing: A dry sterile tip flocked with nylon fiber swab applicator is used to&#xD;
      swab both the tonsils and the posterior pharynx. The swab is placed in a 15 ML Falcon tube&#xD;
      labeled with the patient unique ID and containing 2ml VTM (consisting of sterile solution of&#xD;
      bovine albumin fraction V, HEPES buffer, penicillin and streptomycin in HANK's balanced salt&#xD;
      solution). The applicator stick is then cut off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swabbing: A flexible, sterile tip flocked with nylon fiber swab applicator is&#xD;
      inserted into the nostril and back to the nasopharynx and left in place for a few seconds. It&#xD;
      is then slowly withdrawn with a rotating motion. The swab is inserted in the same tube as the&#xD;
      throat swab and the shaft is cut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tube containing the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab will be agitated vigorously for&#xD;
      10 seconds using a vortex mixer. Both swabs should then be removed from the tube and&#xD;
      discarded using sterile forceps that should be sterilized from one sample to another to avoid&#xD;
      cross contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting supernatant (VTM/UTM) is decanted in 2 cryogenic vials labeled with the patient&#xD;
      ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cryogenic vial will be immediately stored at -70Â°C freezer or lower temperature such as&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen tank for QA and further characterization of the COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other vial will be tested according to the lab capacity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIRAL RNA ISOLATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using commercially available kits supplied by thermofisher or other recommended companies.&#xD;
      Work will be done in Biosafety level 2 cabinets under complete sterile conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 DETECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the test can be&#xD;
      done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or&#xD;
      sputum sample. Results are generally available within a few hours. Molecular methods leverage&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) along with nucleic acid tests, and other advanced analytical&#xD;
      techniques, to detect the genetic material of the virus using real-time reverse transcription&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction for diagnostic purposes. Commercially available kits supplied by&#xD;
      HVD, thermofisher and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus Research Using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) One assay surveying the entire&#xD;
      coronavirus genome for epidemiological investigation: A major challenge for microbiologists&#xD;
      and virologists is the prediction of patterns of evolution and emergence of disease agents.&#xD;
      RNA viruses like the coronavirus share the biological feature of high genetic variability,&#xD;
      which causes them to appear as clouds of mutants. Coronavirus variants also emerge through&#xD;
      antigenic shift within animal reservoirs, such as bats and snakes. Ion Torrent targeted&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables a streamlined research workflow for complete genome&#xD;
      sequencing and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus responsible for&#xD;
      COVID-19). Through the use of a set of highly specific, universal coronavirus primers in&#xD;
      combination with a high-fidelity master mix, all genomic segments are amplified and the DNA&#xD;
      amplicons are sequenced on any Ion Torrent system to deliver highly accurate coronavirus&#xD;
      typing in under a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel consists of 2 pools with amplicons ranging from&#xD;
      125-275 bp in length for complete viral genome sequencing and variant detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioinformatic analysis of the NGS DATA Next-generation sequencing, or NGS, can generate&#xD;
      enormous amounts of data, and the challenge becomes finding ways to analyze it properly. In&#xD;
      this study we are going to use some bioinformatic tools to analyze and track the outbreak in&#xD;
      Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genome Detective bioinformatic tool, Takes the raw data from the sequencing machine, filter&#xD;
      out results from non-viruses, piece together the genome and use that to identify the virus.&#xD;
      It does not rely on any prior guesses or hypotheses, so it can even identify viruses that&#xD;
      have not been seen before. This was used to confirm the first case of COVID-19 in Belgium,&#xD;
      identifying it as a SARS-related coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NextStrain, is an online resource that uses genome data to monitor the evolution of&#xD;
      disease-causing organisms such as viruses in real time. It has tracked several outbreaks&#xD;
      including Zika, Ebola and Dengue and has even been used to inform World Health Organization&#xD;
      policy on seasonal flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NextStrain already has over 700 genomes of the new coronavirus, which it can use to trace the&#xD;
      outbreak by detecting new mutations in the virus. The mutations do not necessarily affect how&#xD;
      the virus behaves, but they can act as a genetic signature to link cases that are related.&#xD;
      Like tracing your ancestry through a DNA test, a virus sequenced in Madrid, for instance,&#xD;
      could have mutations that suggest it originated from an outbreak in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing cases will become even more important because as we start cracking down on (the&#xD;
      pandemic), which we hopefully will achieve, it will tell us how many transmission chains are&#xD;
      still circulating and whether the virus is being transported from one region to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses to be&#xD;
      completed by virology consultant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sequence alignment will be performed with the ClustalW program using MEGA software&#xD;
      (version 7.0.14). Phylogenetic trees will be constructed by means of the maximum-likelihood&#xD;
      method with MEGA software (version 7.0.14). The full-genome viral sequences will be deposited&#xD;
      in the dataset of Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAISD, No.&#xD;
      EPI_ISL_402123, EPI_ISL_403928-31).&#xD;
