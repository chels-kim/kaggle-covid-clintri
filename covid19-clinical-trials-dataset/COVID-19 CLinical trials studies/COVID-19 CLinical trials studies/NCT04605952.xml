    <textblock>
      As a serosurveillance measure asymptomatic employees of an industrial workforce Jamshedpur&#xD;
      (India) were tested for COVID-19 IgG antibodies. Of the tested employees who were positive&#xD;
      for COVID-19 IgG antibodies the study aimed to find the percentage of cases who retained&#xD;
      their COVID-19 IgG antibodies 45-65 days after initially testing positive.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As a serosurveillance measure, 3296 asymptomatic employees of an industrial workforce&#xD;
      Jamshedpur (India) were tested for COVID-19 IgG antibodies specific for the spike subunit&#xD;
      antigen by the ErbaLisa COVID-19, Erba Corporate Services (United Kingdom) between 28th June&#xD;
      and 15th July 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cases who tested positive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies were repeat tested for the presence&#xD;
      of COVID-19 IgG at 45-65 days after initially testing positive. This was done with the aim of&#xD;
      finding out the percentage of cases retaining their IgG antibodies at 45-65 days of initially&#xD;
      testing positive.&#xD;
