  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at developing, implementing and evaluating a complex intervention involving&#xD;
      Learning, Innovation, Volunteers and Empowerment for home dwelling persons with dementia and&#xD;
      their caregivers. The investigators hypothesise that a successfully implemented intervention&#xD;
      will reduce caregivers burden and be cost-effective.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The provision of economically viable and proper care for the growing group of home-dwelling&#xD;
      people with dementia (PWD) is one of the most pressing issues in our society. While a cure&#xD;
      for dementia is not yet available, professionals and policy-makers highly prioritize the&#xD;
      support of caregivers who experience a vast burden. However, there is a lack of high-quality&#xD;
      research investigating clinical, social and economic factors that may add beneficial effects.&#xD;
      This project aims to develop, test, and implement a complex intervention for PWD, intended to&#xD;
      reduce caregivers' burden, which will aid PWD to stay safely, longer and independently at&#xD;
      home with dignity and cost-effectiveness. The term informal caregivers' burden may include&#xD;
      different meanings for different people and be related to economic burden, depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, quality of life (QoL), or simply the quality of sleep and recreation. In a stepped&#xD;
      wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial, involving primary and secondary health care&#xD;
      systems in Bergen, Bærum and Kristiansand the 24-month LIVE@Home.Path study will be&#xD;
      undertaken in a stepped wedge design. The user-inspired and tailored intervention includes a&#xD;
      designated coordinator to the PWD and caregiver for 6 months to introduce a complex&#xD;
      intervention involving a) Learning b) Innovation c) Volunteers and d) Empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will determine users' values and wishes, and promotors and barriers&#xD;
      for successful implementation of the intervention. Primary and secondary outcomes on&#xD;
      cognitive, emotional and social factors, cost-benefit analyses, and QoL of PWD and families&#xD;
      will be assessed every 6-month over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update spring 2020: The COVID-19 pandemic severely hampered the implementation of the&#xD;
      intervention for the second group. We therefore had to change the design, postponing the&#xD;
      intervention in Bærum and Kristiansand, and delivering the intervention in Bergen by phone.&#xD;
      In addition, we initiated the PAN.DEM in the LIVE@Home.Path trial, collecting data from phone&#xD;
      interviews with caregivers on change in Health services and neuropsychiatric symptoms, risk&#xD;
      perception and restrictions. Changes in design approved by Ethical committee (REK: 10861).&#xD;
