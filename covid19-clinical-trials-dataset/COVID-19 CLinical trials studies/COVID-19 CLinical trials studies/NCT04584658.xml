    <measure>Relationship between severity of dysphonia on quality of life using Voice Symptom Scale (VoiSS) questionnaire over time at day 0, 1 month and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>t = day 0, 1 month and 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire assessment: This is a 30-item validated quality of life tool that is also a self-reporting tool. It appraises the impact of the patient's abnormal voice from an emotional perspective, related physical symptoms and stratifies the impairment itself in context of day to day activities. VoiSS is currently the most psychometrically robust voice outcome measure. Each item is scored 0 - 4 on the frequency responses: never, occasionally, some of the time, most of the time, always. The total score of 120 measures general voice pathology which is made up of Impairment = maximum score of 60; Emotional = maximum score of 32; Physical = maximum score of 28</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship between severity of dysphagia on quality of life using Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI) questionnaire over time at day 0, 1 month and 9 months</measure>
    <time_frame>t = day 0, 1 month and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire assessment: This is a 25-item questionnaire assessing three domains: physical (9 items), functional (9 items), and emotional aspects (7 items) of the Quality of Life (QOL) in patients suffering with dysphagia. For each statement the patient checks if it applies to him/her all the time, some of the time or never. The suggested scores are 0, 2 and 4, respectively. Using this scoring system amounts to a DHI score range of 0 - 100. The higher the score, the worse the dysphagia related QOL. The patient is also asked to provide a rating of their own impression of the severity of the dysphagia experienced on a scale from 1 (normal) to 7 (severe problem).</description>

    <intervention_name>Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)</intervention_name>
    <description>This is the use of endoscopy during feeding trials. The patient is fed different consistencies of food and drink while an endoscope is in place (usually passed through the nasal passage and down into the throat). The endoscope provides a bird's eye view to the transit of food through the upper aero-digestive tract. This provides information from the point of food bolus formation in the mouth to the movement of the base of the tongue; the movement of pharyngeal muscles; the deflection of the epiglottis to protect the airway including the closure of the vocal cords and the passage of food into the oesophagus. Any abnormality in these steps are noted during FEES. Liquids, thickened fluids, semi-solids and solids are some of the food textures that are tested.</description>

    <intervention_name>Videofluoroscopy</intervention_name>
    <description>A radio opaque dye is used to label the test food and drink items offered to the patient. Following this, x-ray technology is used to create a video of the outline of the patient and the structures responsible for chewing and swallowing as they injest the test materials. The study is carried out in real time in the radiology department in conjunction with a radiographer and an SLT.</description>
