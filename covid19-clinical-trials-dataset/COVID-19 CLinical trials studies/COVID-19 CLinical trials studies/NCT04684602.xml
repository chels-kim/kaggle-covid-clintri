      This multi-arm, multi-site study investigates the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of stem&#xD;
      cell therapy for the treatment of various acute and chronic conditions. Clinically observed&#xD;
      initial findings and an extensive body of research indicate regenerative treatments are both&#xD;
      safe and effective for the treatment of multiple conditions.&#xD;

      This multi-arm, multi-site study investigates the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of stem&#xD;
      cell therapy for the treatment of various acute and chronic conditions. Clinically observed&#xD;
      initial findings and an extensive body of research indicate regenerative treatments are both&#xD;
      safe and effective for the treatment of multiple conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates clinical outcomes of treatments for numerous indications including:&#xD;
      Autoimmune, Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Integumentary, Neurologic / Neurodegenerative,&#xD;
      Pulmonary, Orthopedic Diseases, Sexual Dysfunction, Urologic Disorders and Viral Illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses posit that regenerative treatments are both safe and statistically beneficial&#xD;
      for a range of conditions. Outcomes will be determined by multiple valid outcome instruments&#xD;
      that measure general quality of life information along with condition-specific information.&#xD;
