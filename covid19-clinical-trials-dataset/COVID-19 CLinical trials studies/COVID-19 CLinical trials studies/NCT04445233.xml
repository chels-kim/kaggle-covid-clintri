  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test and follow persons quarantined at home after testing positive for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (COV) aged 18 years and older and their household members aged 1 year and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to understand how often COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease&#xD;
      2019) spreads in the household when someone who tests positive for the virus self-isolates at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll approximately 200 men and women ≥ 18 years of age who are SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      PCR positive undergoing home quarantine &amp; approximately 200-1500 immediate household&#xD;
      contacts, both male and female, ≥ 1 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test and follow persons quarantined at home after testing positive for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (COV) and their household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CO-HOST mobile nurse initiates a home visit to the home of the COVID-19 index case after&#xD;
      they and their household members (COV-HC) verbally express interest in the study and provide&#xD;
      consent or assent as appropriate. At the first visit, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and blood are&#xD;
      collected from COV and all members of the household (COV-HC) to determine infection status.&#xD;
      Additional samples (nasal swabs, saliva, nasal strips), both nurse-collected and&#xD;
      self-collected, may also be collected from COV and COV-HC. The nurse will provide specific&#xD;
      instructions and training on how to perform self-collected swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week, thereafter, COV-HC are tested during the 28 days of the study. If home visits are&#xD;
      not possible, then participants will perform self-collected swabs for testing. If COV-HC&#xD;
      develops symptoms, they will be referred per standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If COV or COV-HC are hospitalized, they will remain in the study for outcome assessment, but&#xD;
      without further sample collections.&#xD;
