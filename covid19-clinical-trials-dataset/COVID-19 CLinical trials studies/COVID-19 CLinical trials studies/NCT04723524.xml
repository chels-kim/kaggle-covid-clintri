  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is designed to be randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Jinhua Qinggan granules (JHQG) on mild-category&#xD;
      patients of COVID-19 in Pakistani population with the age limit of 18-75 years, within 5th&#xD;
      or/and 10th day comprehensive follow-up. The informed consent form must be signed by the&#xD;
      subjects before their participation in the trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The course of treatment is 10 days, and the visit points are set on the 1st, 5th and 10th&#xD;
      day, in which 5th day and 10th day are follow-up points. The subject could check out at 10th&#xD;
      day when the RT-PCR test becomes negative and asymptomatic. Patients will be assessed by&#xD;
      using seven-category ordinal scale and clinical signs and symptoms on 1st, 5th and 10th day.&#xD;
      If the subject recovers and checks out within 10 days, they will be recorded once before&#xD;
      checking out. All effectiveness and safety inspection items will be done once before the&#xD;
      trial and once at each follow-up point i.e. 5th or/and 10th day. In case of positive RT-PCR&#xD;
      test on 2nd follow-up (10th day), 3rd follow-up for RT-PCR test on 15th day will be planned.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life assessment:</measure>
    <time_frame>during the 10-day course of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life of the product will be assessed by using the Patient's Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire (QOL). The QOL questionnaire is divided into three parts: Psychology, Physiology, and Society. The score of each section is calculated by the sum of score of the part divided by the number of questions. The total is the sum of the three parts, and the minimum importance difference (MID) is 1.3, which means that if the QOL questionnaire score before and after treatment in the same patient rises by 1.3, it indicates that the treatment is effective. At the same time, the higher the QOL score, the lighter the illness is.</description>
