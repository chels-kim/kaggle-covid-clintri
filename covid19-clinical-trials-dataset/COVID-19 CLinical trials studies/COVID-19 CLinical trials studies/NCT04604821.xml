  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., approximately 12% of children under 36 months have language impairments, yet&#xD;
      less than 2% receive early language intervention. Early language intervention is&#xD;
      underutilized nationally, with pronounced service gaps in rural communities. This gap is a&#xD;
      significant issue because children with language impairments are at increased risk for&#xD;
      learning and reading disabilities that can persist into adulthood. Telehealth has the&#xD;
      potential to mitigate service gaps by improving access to treatments, increasing the&#xD;
      availability of clinicians with expertise in language intervention, and reducing healthcare&#xD;
      costs. Telehealth can alleviate logistic and geographic barriers to treatment facing children&#xD;
      with disabilities and their families in rural communities. However, there is insufficient&#xD;
      evidence on the effects of telehealth interventions for children with language impairments&#xD;
      under 36 months. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore innovative telehealth&#xD;
      interventions with potential to improve the quality and efficiency of language treatments.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a feasibility trial (small randomized control trial) to&#xD;
      evaluate a telehealth intervention for children with language impairments and their&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Explore stakeholders' preferences, experiences, and information needs regarding the&#xD;
      delivery of language interventions via telehealth. Ethnographic interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with 16 stakeholders (n= 8 caregivers, 8 clinicians) to explore their preferences,&#xD;
      experiences, and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the effect of telehealth Enhanced Milieu Teaching on caregiver language&#xD;
      strategy use. Caregiver language strategy use will be compared between the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups (n = 28 families, 14 intervention,14 control) during semi-structured&#xD;
      caregiver-child interactions.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in number of Different Words on Structured Language Sample</measure>
    <time_frame>1 pre-intervention assessment (start of study) and 1 post intervention assessment through study completion (3-4 months later).</time_frame>
    <description>A language sample is a naturalistic adult-child interaction with a specific set of toys to evaluate a child's spontaneous expressive language ability.&#xD;
Metric/ Measurement Unit: Change in frequency count of the number of different words spoken during a 20 minute language sample.</description>

    <time_frame>1 pre-intervention assessment (start of study) and 1 post intervention assessment through study completion (3-4 months later).</time_frame>
    <description>The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) is a parent report instrument which captures important information about children's developing abilities in early language, including vocabulary comprehension, production, gestures, and grammar.&#xD;
An increase in the productive vocabulary represents a positive outcome.&#xD;
Metric/ Measurement Unit: Number of words expressed on the MCDI. The range of this instrument is 0 - 396.</description>

    <measure>Change in Individual Growth and Development Indicators for Infants and Toddlers- Early Communication Indicator (IGDI-ECI) score through 3-4 months of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Once per month of intervention through study completion (3-4 months of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The ECI is a brief, repeatable, play-based, observational measure of a child's communicative performance during a 6-minute play period with a familiar adult. It measures the number of gestures, vocalizations, single words, and multiple word combinations during this play period.&#xD;
An increase in the ECI presents a positive outcome.&#xD;
Metric/ Measurement Unit: Frequency count of communication utterances expressed during the 6 minute play interaction. ECI scores are weighted such that each single-word utterance is given a weight of two (each tally is multiplied by two), and each multiple word utterance is given a weight of three (each tally is multiplied by three)</description>

    <measure>Change in Preschool-Language Scales - 5th edition (PLS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 pre-intervention assessment (start of study) and 1 post intervention assessment through study completion (3-4 months later).</time_frame>
    <description>PLSâ„¢-5 Preschool Language Scales Fifth Edition offers a comprehensive developmental language assessment with items that range from pre-verbal, interaction-based skills to emerging language to early literacy.&#xD;
Increases on the PLS-5 represent a positive outcome.&#xD;
Metric/ Measurement Unit: Total Standard Score Range = 50 - 150 (Mean = 100, SD = 15).&#xD;
If we are unable to administer assessments to all participants in person due to public health impacts of COVID-19, we will report the raw scores because the PLS-5 is not standardized for telepractice administration. Raw scores range 0 - 132.</description>
