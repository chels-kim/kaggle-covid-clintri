  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that are hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see whether neutralizing interleukin-8 (IL-8) with BMS-986253 can&#xD;
      help improve the health condition of participants infected with COVID-19. This is the first&#xD;
      in-human study of this investigational product specifically in patients with severe COVID-19.&#xD;
      Currently there are no FDA approved medications that improve the chance of survival in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However there are usual treatments currently being used to&#xD;
      help treat COVID-19 patients and BMS-986253 will be compared to these standard of care&#xD;
      treatments in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, phase 2 trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      time-to-improvement in the 7 point ordinal scale following treatment with anti-IL-8 therapy&#xD;
      (BMS-986253) compared to standard of care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory&#xD;
      disease. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either BMS-986253 or standard of care.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to treatment with BMS-986253 will receive between 1-3 doses of therapy&#xD;
      depending on their clinical status. Participants will be assessed daily while in the hospital&#xD;
      and with then be followed for up to 1 year after discharge.&#xD;
