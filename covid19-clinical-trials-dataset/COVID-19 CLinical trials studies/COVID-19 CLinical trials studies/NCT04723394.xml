    <textblock>
      This Phase III study will assess whether AZD7442 (a combination of 2 mAbs) can safely treat&#xD;
      outpatient adults with COVID-19 and prevent either severe COVID-19 or death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in China in November 2019 causing cases of&#xD;
      atypical pneumonia. As of 6 October 2020, the virus has spread to all corners of the globe,&#xD;
      with over 35 million confirmed cases reported and more than one million associated deaths&#xD;
      according to the WHO. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing major disruption to global healthcare&#xD;
      systems with significant socioeconomic impacts. Effective interventions to prevent or treat&#xD;
      COVID-19 remain few in number and clinical experience is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to rapidly evaluate treatments in the non-hospitalized setting to&#xD;
      prevent progression and reduce serious complications of COVID-19, as well as its&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a response to the ongoing pandemic, AstraZeneca is developing mAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike&#xD;
      protein. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains the virus's RBD, which enables the virus to&#xD;
      bind to receptors on human cells. By targeting this region of the virus's spike protein,&#xD;
      antibodies can block the virus's attachment to human cells, and, therefore, is expected to&#xD;
      block infection. Amino acid substitutions have been introduced into the antibodies to both&#xD;
      extend their half-lives, which should prolong their potential prophylactic benefit, and&#xD;
      decrease Fc effector function in order to decrease the potential risk of antibody-dependent&#xD;
      enhancement of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD7442, a combination of 2 of these mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated for&#xD;
      administration to treat or prevent COVID-19. There are currently one ongoing Phase I study&#xD;
      and two ongoing Phase III studies with AZD7442, in addition to this treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of approximately 1700 participants is planned.&#xD;
