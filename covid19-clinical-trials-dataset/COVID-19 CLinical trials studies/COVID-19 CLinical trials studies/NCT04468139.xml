  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its&#xD;
      prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular&#xD;
      details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The drugs we are chosen are used as clinical trials for&#xD;
      antiviral and there is no proven guide for specificity and effectiveness against the virus so&#xD;
      the results are different Now the clinical trials and research authorities are work speedily&#xD;
      to target the most proven treatment for the virus so anything is infantile until now. the&#xD;
      covid-19 with time be more explained by scientists it is steroid response disease and cause&#xD;
      thromosis and cytokine storm , the aim of the study to inhibit viral replication and decrease&#xD;
      the severity of the disease as antiviral and anticytokine storm , antithrombosis Zinc is a&#xD;
      mineral element needed to regulate adaptive immune cells' functions. Higher level of&#xD;
      intracellular zinc showed to increase intracellular pH; which affect on RNA-dependent RNA&#xD;
      polymerase and decrease replication mechanism of RNA viruses. Therefore, drugs that described&#xD;
      as zinc ionophores could be used with zinc supplement to act as antiviral against many RNA&#xD;
      viruses including SARS-CoV-2 Quercetin is natural compound act as zinc ionophore to cause&#xD;
      zinc influx intracellular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quercetin is a safe natural anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenolic compound that&#xD;
      found in various natural sources include onion, red grapes, honey and citrus fruits. It was&#xD;
      shown that quercetin has the ability to chelate zinc ions and act as zinc ionophore.&#xD;
      Therefore, quercetin could have antiviral activity against many RNA viruses . Quercetin, a&#xD;
      flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, has unique biological properties that may improve&#xD;
      mental/physical performance and reduce infection risk ; These properties form the basis for&#xD;
      potential benefits to overall health and disease resistance, including anti-carcinogenic,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and psychostimulant activities, as well as the&#xD;
      ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation and capillary permeability, and&#xD;
      to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis .There are various studies that report the&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effect of bromelain . Bromelain activates natural killer cells and augments&#xD;
      the production of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-2, IL-6 and decreases&#xD;
      the activation of Thelper cells. Thus, bromelain decreases the majority of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators and has demonstrated a significant role as an anti-inflammatory agent in various&#xD;
      conditions Vitamin C is known as an essential anti-oxidant.,and enzymatic co-factor for&#xD;
      physiological reactions such as hormone production, collagen synthesis and immune&#xD;
      potentiation . Naturally, an insufficiency of vitamin C leads to severe injuries to multiple&#xD;
      organs, especially to the heart and brain, since they are both highly aerobic organs that&#xD;
      produce more oxygen radicals. In fact, studies of in vivo effect on vitamin C are difficult&#xD;
      since most animals, except human and some primate, are capable of synthesizing vitamin C&#xD;
      endogenously&#xD;
