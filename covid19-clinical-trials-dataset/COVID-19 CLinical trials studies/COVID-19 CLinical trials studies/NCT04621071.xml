  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 disease caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has received worldwide attention.&#xD;
      No specific antiviral treatment is recommended for COVID-19 and no vaccine is currently&#xD;
      available. Probiotics may be considered as an option of treatment since they have anti-viral&#xD;
      effect, trigger immunomodulation and have low side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics to reduce the&#xD;
      duration and symptoms of COVID-19 in a symptomatic population tested positive to SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      self-caring at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational: COVID-19 disease is caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and has received&#xD;
      worldwide attention. No specific antiviral treatment is recommended for COVID-19 and no&#xD;
      vaccine is currently available so far. Several strong arguments support the study of&#xD;
      probiotics for COVID-19: 1) probiotics act on viruses by various well described mechanisms&#xD;
      (reduction of absorption, cellular internalization of the virus, production of metabolites /&#xD;
      substances having a direct antiviral effect; and immunomodulation); 2) probiotics are&#xD;
      considered with a high level of evidence (meta-analysis) to reduce diarrhea (associated with&#xD;
      antibiotics and Clostridium difficile) and for respiratory tract infections; 3) probiotics&#xD;
      are affordable and available with low side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of probiotics on the duration of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients,&#xD;
           with moderate forms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effect of probiotics on the severity of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients,&#xD;
           with moderate forms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effect of probiotics on the evolution of oral and fecal microbiota in&#xD;
           symptomatic patients, with moderate forms of the COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Men and women, 18 years or older, with a first positive test for COVID-19 in the&#xD;
      last 5 days, having symptoms of the COVID-19, self-caring at home, living in Quebec for the&#xD;
      next 60 days, able to take medication alone, with access to a phone or to the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material: After providing consent remotely (electronic or recorded by phone), patients will&#xD;
      receive by mail at home: : a leaflet explaining the study, the study product (probiotics or&#xD;
      placebo) for 25 days, a container of maple syrup and a cup, a thermometer, an oximeter, a&#xD;
      logbook, 2 saliva sample self-collection kits, 2 stool sample self-collection kits and&#xD;
      instruction sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomized in one of the study groups (stratified by age and&#xD;
      gender). The randomization is double-blind and uses a ratio 1:1. Group A: will take&#xD;
      probiotics for up to 25 days / Group B: will take placebo for up to 25 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Upon inclusion in the study, the participant will complete a questionnaire that&#xD;
      will focus on socio-demographic (age, marital status), medical (weight, height, general&#xD;
      health, current medication, symptomsâ€¦), food intake and other relevant information. The&#xD;
      participants will fill a daily booklet evaluating their symptoms, compliance to treatment,&#xD;
      medication intake, temperature, oxygen saturation value, etc. For those who will be admitted&#xD;
      to hospital, data on their admission, complications and treatments will be collected. At 55&#xD;
      days after their enrollment, will fill an end of study questionnaire (symptoms, satisfaction,&#xD;
      well-being, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples: The study includes the optional collection of saliva and stool samples twice, on Day&#xD;
      1 (before the first product is taken) and on Day 10.&#xD;
