  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of an innovative exercise program referred&#xD;
      to as movement-2-music (M2M) on health and fitness outcomes in adults with physical/mobility&#xD;
      disabilities. One hundred and eight participants with physical/mobility disabilities will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomly enrolled into one of two groups: a) M2M or b) waitlist control. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of a 12-week M2M program on health and&#xD;
      fitness in participants with physical/mobility disabilities who are in one of three&#xD;
      functional mobility groups: 1) Group I - only able to exercise while sitting, 2) Group II -&#xD;
      able to exercise sitting and standing with/without support, and 3) Group III - able to&#xD;
      exercise one side of the body more than the other side. The second aim is to compare the&#xD;
      observed effects of the program in this study to a previous M2M study that groups&#xD;
      participants based on disability type. The third aim of this study is to test whether&#xD;
      adherence (defined as attendance to the 12-week program) affects the effects of M2M in&#xD;
      participants with physical/mobility disabilities. The potential influences of different&#xD;
      functional mobility and disabilities of participants on how the program affects participants'&#xD;
      health and fitness outcomes will also be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **In response to COVID-19, the 12-week M2M intervention and all assessments have been&#xD;
      modified from being delivered in-person at Lakeshore Foundation to being delivered remotely&#xD;
      in real-time through videoconferencing technology.**&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention efficacy trial examines a remotely-delivered, rhythmic-based&#xD;
      movement-2-music (eM2M) intervention with 108 adults with physical/mobility disabilities who&#xD;
      are randomized into one of two groups: a) eM2M or b) waitlist control. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      determine the effects of a 12-week eM2M intervention on physical and psychosocial health&#xD;
      outcomes in participants with physical/mobility disabilities who are classified into three&#xD;
      functional mobility groups: 1) Group I - only able to exercise while sitting, 2) Group II -&#xD;
      able to exercise sitting and standing with/without support, and 3) Group III - able to&#xD;
      exercise one side of the body more than the other side. The secondary aim is to compare&#xD;
      effect sizes of the physical health outcomes including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle&#xD;
      strength and lower extremity function obtained in the current study to a previous M2M trial&#xD;
      that grouped participants based on disability type. The tertiary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      explore whether adherence (defined in terms of attendance to the 12-week intervention)&#xD;
      moderates effects of eM2M in participants with physical/mobility disabilities. The&#xD;
      heterogeneity of treatment effect across the physical health outcomes will also be examined&#xD;
      using functional mobility and disability groups as moderators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a set of assessments at baseline and after the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention period remotely through videoconferencing technology. They will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire portion of the assessments every 6 months and the entire set of&#xD;
      assessments every year for up to 5 years. The assessments include cardiorespiratory fitness&#xD;
      measured using a heart rate recovery test, grip strength measured using hand-held&#xD;
      dynamometer, lower extremity function measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery&#xD;
      and the Timed Up and Go test as well as questionnaires that assess health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (NIH PROMIS 10 Global Health Items, NIH PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles&#xD;
      and Activities), physical activity (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire), exercise&#xD;
      self-efficacy (Exercise Self-efficacy Scale), exercise goal-setting (Exercise Goal-setting&#xD;
      Scale), outcome expectation for exercise (Multidimensional Outcomes Expectations for Exercise&#xD;
      Scale), social support (Social Provision Scale) and barriers in physical activity (Barriers&#xD;
      in Physical Activity Questionnaire). In addition, at the end of the 12-week intervention,&#xD;
      participants will be interviewed about their study experience and perceived impact of eM2M on&#xD;
      their fitness and health.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline physical activity at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity is measured using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire. The questionnaire contains two questions. The first question asks participants to report weekly frequencies of activities they perform at different intensities. A total weekly leisure activity is a sum of activity scores calculated by multiplying the weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities by 9, 5, and 3, respectively. The second question asks participants the frequency of weekly leisure-time activities performed that are long enough to work up a sweat.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline barriers in physical activity at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Barriers in physical activity will be assessed using the Barriers in Physical Activity Questionnaire. The instrument contains 43 items. Each item is responded with either no (1) or yes (2). If response is yes, a follow-up response that ranges from 1 (very small) to 5 (very large) is selected. There are 8 domains, which include personal health, attitudes/beliefs towards physical activity, friends, family, fitness center built environment, policy/programs/staff, community built environment, and safety. Each domain score is calculated by summing the item responses with its respective item weight. Higher domain scores indicate greater perceived barriers to physical activity.</description>
