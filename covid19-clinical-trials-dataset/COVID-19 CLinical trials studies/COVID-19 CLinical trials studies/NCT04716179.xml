    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection is hypothesized to have a potentially negative effect on male fertility&#xD;
      through direct damage to the testes. The current trial is aimed at investigating the effect&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 on fertility and determining if viral bodies are capable of directly damaging&#xD;
      testicular cells&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In late December 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan witnessed the emergence of a form of&#xD;
      pneumonia of unknown etiology. By the middle of January 2020, the disease had managed to&#xD;
      spread beyond the country of origin and is now classified by the WHO as the largest pandemic&#xD;
      in modern history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapidly spreading and highly contagious, the infection prompted medical professionals all&#xD;
      over the world to begin research into the virus with the goal of developing early diagnostic&#xD;
      techniques and treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new pathogen named SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family. These viruses cause&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1, 2002-2003) and Middle East respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome (MERS, 2012-2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the human body stem from its structure. The spike proteins on&#xD;
      the surface of the virus, which are responsible for the name &quot;Coronaviridae,&quot; means that it&#xD;
      is able to bind to the host receptor protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This&#xD;
      makes cells with high quantities of these receptors on the surface susceptible to the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genome of SARS-Cov-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic contains both human&#xD;
      coronavirus fragments and bat coronavirus fragments (HKU9-1). It is the genetic material of&#xD;
      HKU9-1 that makes SARS-CoV-2 unknown to the immune system of the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today, three transmission pathways are recognized: close contact, airborne and fomite.&#xD;
      Moreover, the virus is known to retain its contagious properties on surfaces for up to 72&#xD;
      hours, and the incubation period ranges between 2 and 14 days. Recent reports indicate that&#xD;
      up to 80% of those infected by COVID-19 showed mild or moderate symptoms whereas 20-30%&#xD;
      develop severe forms of the disease characterized by shock as well as respiratory and&#xD;
      multiple organ failure. According to Chinese and Italian healthcare providers, the mortality&#xD;
      rate is between 3.8 and 7.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zou et al. (2020) reported that non-respiratory symptoms may be explained by the binding of&#xD;
      the virus to ACE-2 in other organs. Shen and Wang (2020) proved that ACE-2 is also expressed&#xD;
      by testicular cells (namely spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells) which makes them&#xD;
      potential targets for the virus. In fact, there are reports of orchitis and epididymitis in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19. This means that SARS-CoV-2 may directly damage testicular&#xD;
      tissue potentially compromising male fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a number of studies, PCR did not detect the virus in semen samples obtained during both&#xD;
      the acute phase and recovery phase. In another study, postmortem needle and open biopsies of&#xD;
      the testicles performed within an hour after death from COVID-19 revealed that testicular&#xD;
      tissues were free of SARS-CoV-2 in 10 of 11 cases (91%). At the same time, spermograms in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients showed low ejaculate volume, sperm motility and sperm count. Previously, it&#xD;
      was shown that COVID-19 has a severe effect on vasculature and therefore a microthrombi could&#xD;
      be a possible contributor to fertility impairment. An assessment of testes with a Doppler&#xD;
      enhanced ultrasound was therefore necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data dedicated to testosterone levels in the blood and inflammatory markers in the semen and&#xD;
      testicular tissues is lacking. Available literature indicates changes in the above-mentioned&#xD;
      parameters in males with verified COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is ultimately too little information to draw reliable conclusions regarding the effects&#xD;
      of the virus on male reproduction. Published reports are limited by small study groups, lack&#xD;
      of the control group and absence of follow-up examinations during recovery warranting further&#xD;
      research and in-depth exploration of the topic.&#xD;
