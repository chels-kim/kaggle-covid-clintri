    <textblock>
      This study investigates the experiences of cancer patients with neuropathy during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic to learn how the COVID-19 pandemic affects their quality of life and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. This study will also explore whether there are differences between&#xD;
      patients who received neurofeedback (NFB, a type of therapy that is thought to help normalize&#xD;
      brain activity) and those who did not. Learning about quality of life in cancer patients with&#xD;
      neuropathy during the COVID-19 pandemic may help guide development of programs and policies&#xD;
      to improve chronic pain patient care and outcomes during a major global healthcare crisis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (e.g. physical, emotional, social well-being), and&#xD;
      other COVID-19-specific domains (e.g. anxiety, social interactions, finances), and the&#xD;
      associations between COVID-19 experiences and COVID-19-specific distress, HRQOL and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of patients who participated in one of three clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine differences in outcomes between neuropathic pain patients who participated in one&#xD;
      of two trials of NFB and received NFB, and neuropathic pain patients who participated in a&#xD;
      non-treatment-related neuropathy study (i.e., who did not receive NFB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the extent to which coping and resilience factors moderate the effects of&#xD;
      COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific distress, HRQOL and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete an online questionnaire over 15 minutes about their experiences regarding&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic including testing, risks of exposure, whether people they know have&#xD;
      acquired COVID-19, as well as questions on how the pandemic has impacted their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

    <description>We will use the COVID-19 Specific questionnaire. This scale will ask 15 questions that are organized into three sections: (a) Questions specific to the COVID-19 pandemic such as testing, serostatus, risk factors, loss of family or friends, isolation; (b) Thoughts, experiences and emotions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic; and (c) Health-related quality of life. This assessment was developed by Lorenzo Cohen (MD Anderson), in collaboration with investigators from the University of Miami and UCLA and is a comprehensive assessment of COVID-19 experiences.</description>
