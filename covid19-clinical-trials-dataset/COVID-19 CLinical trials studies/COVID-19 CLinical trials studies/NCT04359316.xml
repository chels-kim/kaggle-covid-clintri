      The present study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial, with the&#xD;
      approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test&#xD;
      confirming COVID-19 in Shahid Modarres Medical Education Center and Hospital in Tehran.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the two arms of the study and after completing the&#xD;
      course of treatment and collecting and analyzing the necessary information from each patient,&#xD;
      the results of the study will be published both on this site and in the form of an article in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chloroquine has been a broadly-utilized anti-malaria agent which back in 2006, had been&#xD;
      proved to be a powerful wide-spectrum antiviral. Moreover, Chloroquine has the&#xD;
      characteristics of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory by inhibiting the production of&#xD;
      TNF-α along with IL-6. In the first half of February, a study illustrated puissant inhibition&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500-mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar&#xD;
      to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. According to the news briefing of a&#xD;
      study, it was indicated that chloroquine phosphate actually outdo the control treatment in&#xD;
      inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation, improving lung imaging findings, and curtailing the&#xD;
      disease course. Another study evaluated the possible doses of CQ and HCQ to find the&#xD;
      optimized dose in treatment of COVID-19. They revealed that while within in-vitro settings&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg&#xD;
      daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day&#xD;
      divided in two separate doses, which was three-fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice&#xD;
      daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days. The new study published in 16th March, pointed&#xD;
      out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the&#xD;
      nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and&#xD;
      even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant&#xD;
      interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID-19. In spite&#xD;
      of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of&#xD;
      chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported clinical benefits of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 come either from media reports or nonrandomized trials with small&#xD;
      numbers of participants (&lt;100 patients). The documented benefit of hydroxychloroquine with or&#xD;
      without azithromycin is very limited, especially in severe disease. While these medications,&#xD;
      individually or in combination, may prove efficacious, these benefits need to be established&#xD;
      with randomized clinical trials prior to widespread adoption of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial, with the&#xD;
      approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test&#xD;
      confirming COVID-19 in Shahid Modarres Medical Education Center and Hospital in Tehran.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the two arms of the study and after completing the&#xD;
      course of treatment and collecting and analyzing the necessary information from each patient,&#xD;
