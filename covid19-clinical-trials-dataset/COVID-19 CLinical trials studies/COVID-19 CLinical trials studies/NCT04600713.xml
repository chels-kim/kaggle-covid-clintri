      Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) induce, in the affected patient, a prominent negative&#xD;
      effect on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and physical fitness. The health care&#xD;
      utilisation is high and the patient does never know when the next attack of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation occurs. Therefore, is physical exertion often avoided due to fear of new&#xD;
      attacks. Further, are shortness of breath and fatigue often present despite of prescribed&#xD;
      modern drugs. Paroxysmal AF per se enhance markedly the risk to develop stroke and heart&#xD;
      failure, which both are syndromes that cause further negative effect on the patient´s HR-QoL&#xD;
      and physical fitness. Altogether, cause the symptoms in paroxysmal AF a vicious spiral where&#xD;
      both VO2max and muscle function deteriorate. The problems with shortness of breath might be&#xD;
      due to dysfunction in respiratory muscles. Physiotherapy led exercise within cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PT-X) in combination with inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has shown&#xD;
      positive effects in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. However, to our knowledge,&#xD;
      not yet investigated in patients with paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Primary to investigate, in a multicentre randomised controlled trial, if PT-X in&#xD;
      combination with IMT can impact HR-QoL in patients with paroxysmal AF. Secondary to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of PT-X in combination with IMT regarding symptoms, physical fitness,&#xD;
      physical activity and the number of atrial fibrillation attacks and health care costs&#xD;
      compared to the control group, asked to live their usual life, during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: PTX in combination with IMT can improve HR-QoL, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function, level of symptoms, physical fitness and physical activity in patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF. In addition, a reduced number of atrial fibrillation attacks could decrease&#xD;
      the direct cost of health care.&#xD;

      Introduction Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) induce, in the affected patient an increased&#xD;
      risk of stroke and heart failure. The corner stone in the medical treatment for AF is&#xD;
      anticoagulants and heartrate regulators which affect the physical fitness. Other&#xD;
      interventions available for rhythm regulation such as antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion and&#xD;
      catheter ablation are alternatives aimed to be relief the symptoms of AF and increase the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Despite this advanced pharmacologic- and&#xD;
      electrotherapy studies evaluating Patient Related Outcomes measures (PROMs) have shown that&#xD;
      the symptoms persist and the HR-QoL is still reduced after treatment. Furthermore, Gleason et&#xD;
      al, have recently shown that women have a comparatively higher frequency of symptoms, anxiety&#xD;
      and depression despite type of intervention. The majority &gt; 90 %, of the patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF have symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, reduced physical fitness and&#xD;
      breathlessness. The unpredictability regarding the source of an AF attack, duration and&#xD;
      frequencies causes the patient suffering, high healthcare utilization and increased sick&#xD;
      leave, this result in high expenditures for AF related causes both for the patient and&#xD;
      society. To avoid physical activity and exercise due to fear of an AF attack is not unusual,&#xD;
      which may further lead to a reduced physical fitness i.e maximal oxygen capacity (VO2max) and&#xD;
      an increased risk of stroke and mortality. This may lead to an evil circle with additional&#xD;
      reduced physical fitness, possibly an increase in symptoms and a more reduced HR-QoL. The&#xD;
      underlying causes of reduced physical fitness and breathlessness associated with AF is&#xD;
      probably multifactorial. One reason could be skeletal muscle abnormities as in heart failure,&#xD;
      which often coexists with AF. An increased mortality in the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is seen in individuals with older age, cardiovascular disease and in&#xD;
      men, and the most usual complication is arrythmia such as AF. COVID-19 is a disease that&#xD;
      affect the persons lungs and it is not uncommon with pulmonary complications. This can lead&#xD;
      to an increased demand for exercise-based rehabilitation in patients with AF and reduced&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength. One study has shown that a reduced respiratory muscle function&#xD;
      can positively be affected with inspiratory muscle training in patients with permanent AF.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a Cochrane report have shown that exercise can improve physical fitness in&#xD;
      patients with AF, however, no effect was seen in HR-QoL. However, patients with paroxysmal&#xD;
      AF, were underrepresented and additional studies concerning patients with paroxysmal AF are&#xD;
      requested. Whether physiotherapist-led exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (PT-X) and&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT) can improve physical fitness and positively affect symptoms&#xD;
      and consequently improve HR-QoL is to our knowledge not studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Primary to investigate, in a multicentre randomised controlled trial, if PT-X in&#xD;
      combination with IMT can impact HR-QoL in patients with paroxysmal AF. Secondary to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of PT-X in combination with IMT regarding symptoms, physical fitness,&#xD;
      physical activity and the number of atrial fibrillation attacks and health care costs&#xD;
      compared to the control group, asked to live their usual life, during the study period.&#xD;
      Further to investigate the prevalence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, and the patient's own&#xD;
      experience of how COVID-19 has affected their incidence and symptoms of paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question formulations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary question How will participation in PT-X and IMT impact the short form SF-36 general&#xD;
      health score compared to the control group that is allowed to continue with their usual life?&#xD;
      Secondary questions How will participation in PT-X and IMT impact the exercise capacity&#xD;
      compared to the control group that is allowed to continue with their usual life? How will&#xD;
      participation in PT-X and IMT affect symptoms of AF and fatigue compared to the control group&#xD;
      that is allowed to continue with their usual life? How will participation in PT-X and IMT&#xD;
      affect the muscle function compared to the control group that is allowed to continue with&#xD;
      their usual life? How will participation in PT-X and IMT affect the frequency, duration and&#xD;
      number of AF attacks compared to the control group that is allowed to continue with their&#xD;
      usual life? How is the incidence of depression among the participants in the study, and is it&#xD;
      possible to impact the prevalence of AF with participation in PT-X and IMT compared to the&#xD;
      control group that is allowed to continue with their usual life? How has the COVID-19&#xD;
      affected the patient's own experience of number of attacks, symptoms and duration of AF? How&#xD;
      is the prevalence of antibodies for SARs-CoV-2 among the participants in the present study?&#xD;
      Method Study design A multi-centre randomised controlled trial Patients A total of 180&#xD;
      patients with paroxysmal AF, age 40 - 85 years, visiting the cardiology clinic at SV Hospital&#xD;
      group Alingsås Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital and primary care will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Advertising in the daily press will be made for participants with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF. The patients will be informed both verbal and in written information, and a&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and power calculation The patients will be randomised stratified after sex, age&#xD;
      and exercise capacity measured by the symptom-limited ergometer cycle test. Ratio and&#xD;
      interval data will be presented as mean (± 1 SD), ordinal data will be presented as median&#xD;
      (range) and nominal data in absolute and relative numbers. Depending on if the data are&#xD;
      normal distributed or not the Student T-Test or the Mann-Whitney U- test will be used for&#xD;
      evaluation of differences between the groups. Chi2 test will be used for evaluation of&#xD;
      differences between the nominal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using a power (β) of 80% and a significance level of (α) 5%.&#xD;
      Based on the assumption of a mean (SD) significant (p=0.05) difference in the PT-X group&#xD;
      compared to the control group regarding improvement of SF-36 General Health score of 7.5 ± 15&#xD;
      points a total of 76 patients are needed in each group. Based on the assumption of a&#xD;
      calculated withdraw of approximately 20% a total of 180 participants are needed to be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
