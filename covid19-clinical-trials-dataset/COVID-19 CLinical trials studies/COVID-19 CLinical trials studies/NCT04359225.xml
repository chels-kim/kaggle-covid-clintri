  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is critical to establish an effective form of telemedicine during the Covid 19 pandemic,&#xD;
      that will allow safe social distancing of clinicians and patients. The investigators serve as&#xD;
      the regional plastic, burns and reconstructive centre for the West of Scotland, population 3&#xD;
      million. All face to face clinics have been cancelled and converted to telephone/telemedicine&#xD;
      only consultations. The investigators will establish both 2D and 3D telemedicine as normal&#xD;
      patient follow up practice during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to implement a 3D telemedicine system to facilitate patient follow up and remote&#xD;
      physiotherapy, that will act as if the patient is physically 'present' in the room.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy is crucial to patient outcomes after burns contractures, hand trauma and cancer&#xD;
      reconstruction. The 3D telemedicine system will be built by an industrial partner, with CE&#xD;
      marked equipment, specifically to help during the Covid-19 Pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study forms a follow on study to the investigator's pilot study (based on clinical&#xD;
      feedback only)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Covid pandemic the Canniesburn Plastic Surgery Unit has stopped face to face clinics.&#xD;
      The investigators therefore aim to assess current telemedicine options from a clinician&#xD;
      viewpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is the 3D telemedicine study important during Covid 19?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Augment not replace current telemedicine capabilities. 3D telemedicine system would be&#xD;
           transformative - much of Plastic Surgery work is 3 dimensional e.g. burns contractures,&#xD;
           cleft lip. A 3D system may therefore give clinicians a more 'realistic' and accurate&#xD;
           representation of patient interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce viral load in clinic. This will reduce face to face contact. High viral load&#xD;
           transmission (eg in the confines of an all day clinic) may be associated with higher&#xD;
           risk of healthcare worker mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Facilitate remote therapies and improve patient outcomes. Current 2D telemedicine (e.g.&#xD;
           Attend Anywhere) is limited in the ability to remotely guide patient therapies - the&#xD;
           therapist cannot guide the camera or look at specific areas of interest. With 3D&#xD;
           telemedicine the therapist can 'walk around' the patient as if the patient were&#xD;
           co-present, and look at areas of interest with ease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurements of angles/other clinical measurements. For example, after a burns&#xD;
           contracture or hand trauma a clinician may want to measure the angles at the wrist joint&#xD;
           to see if there is any improvement. This cannot be done accurately with 2D telemedicine.&#xD;
           3D telemedicine may facilitate the measurement of angles and assess outcomes but this is&#xD;
           unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Randomised Controlled Trial. Single blinded (participants blinded - unaware of type of&#xD;
      telemedicine, clinicians unblinded - aware of type of telemedicine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will review clinician's assessments of telemedicine and clinical assessment of&#xD;
      patients using telemedicine. These will consist of the plastic surgery patients selected from&#xD;
      general plastic surgery clinic including patients with breast reconstruction, sarcoma, limb&#xD;
      reconstruction, head &amp; neck reconstruction, flap reconstruction, hand trauma and cleft lip,&#xD;
      and will be known to the research team. The assessment is of the telemedicine system by the&#xD;
      clinician only. There will be two sites, the 'remote' site where the patient attends, and the&#xD;
      'central' site where the clinician reviews the patient. Remote site will be at West Glasgow&#xD;
      Ambulatory Care Hospital (Covid free site) and the central location will be Glasgow Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The investigators aim to answer the question &quot;How does 3D telemedicine compare to 2D&#xD;
      telemedicine?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Effort Rating Scale, University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) scales, Telehealth&#xD;
      Usability Questionnaire (TUQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective feedback with transcribing, coding and thematic analysis. Measurements (where&#xD;
      applicable e.g. angles of contracture in hand) Outcome scoring scales (where applicable e.g.&#xD;
      validated Unilateral Cleft Score Surgical Outcomes Evaluation Scale - UCLSOE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The pilot/feasibility study will generate data for sample size calculation. No&#xD;
      data exist for sample size calculations of 3D versus 2D telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Block randomisation. Patient randomised to 2D or 3D telemedicine first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment with Telemedicine The patient is examined with the randomly allocated type&#xD;
      of telemedicine and the duration of consultation recorded. The telemedicine room is the same&#xD;
      for both 2D and 3D telemedicine, and uses the same equipment. After the consultation the&#xD;
      patient does not require further participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician Feedback The clinician fills in a questionnaire assessment of the type of&#xD;
      telemedicine used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician records measurements where applicable Clinician records outcome scoring scales&#xD;
      where applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes UNN questionnaire Mental Effort Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Telehealth Usability Questionnaire Subjective interview Patient&#xD;
      measurements (where applicable) Patient outcome scales (where applicable)&#xD;
