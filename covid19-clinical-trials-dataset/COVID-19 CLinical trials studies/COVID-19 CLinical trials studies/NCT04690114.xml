    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to conduct an epidemiological survey of the pediatric&#xD;
      population via SARS CoV-2 IgG antibody testing in order to evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      asymptomatic infection and seropositivity among children and establish risk factors of&#xD;
      infection and characterization of asymptomatic carriers. Additionally, among seropositive&#xD;
      children, antibody titers will be explored in order to reach a better understanding of the&#xD;
      relationship between immunity over time after different types of initial exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Design and Population A prospective epidemiological survey was conducted in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, a tertiary medical&#xD;
      center in Jerusalem, Israel, between October 2020 and January 2021. All patients presenting&#xD;
      to the pediatric ED during the study period and requiring blood tests or and IV insertion for&#xD;
      any clinical reason were considered eligible to participate in the study. The parents and/or&#xD;
      legal guardians of these patients gave oral consent for an additional 1-3 ml of blood to be&#xD;
      sent for Sars-CoV-2 antibody testing. In addition, all consenting parent/guardians filled out&#xD;
      a comprehensive questionnaire regarding demographic background, past medical history, and&#xD;
      specific Covid-19 details such as exposures to carriers, past PCR testing, symptoms etc. All&#xD;
      patients with positive serology results were contacted by phone and updated of the test&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing All blood samples were collected in a clot-activator test tube. Initial&#xD;
      testing was conducted using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. A positive result was considered&#xD;
      a value above 1.5 with 0.8 - 1.4 cosidered grayzone results. All positive and grayzone&#xD;
      results were then retested in the DiaSoren LIAISONÂ® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics for Windows,&#xD;
      Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Clinical variables were analyzed using the Chi-squared&#xD;
      test for categorical variables and the t-test for continuous variables. All statistical tests&#xD;
      were two-way tests and P value of 5% or less was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
