    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (1:1) clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in the treatment of adult subjects with COVID-19-moderate type.&#xD;
Subjects within 10 days of COVID-19 onset will be screened, and be randomized as early as possible within 24 hours following screen success.&#xD;
It is planned to randomize 100 subjects in an 1:1 ratio. Subjects in the test group will receive supportive care recommended in the current guidelines+Favipiravir, and subjects in the control group will receive supportive care recommended in the current guidelines+placebo control; the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir versus the placebo in the treatment of COVID-19-moderate type will be compared.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Voluntarily participating in the clinical study; fully understanding and being fully&#xD;
             informed of the study and having signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF); willingness&#xD;
             and capability to complete all the study procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18-75 years (inclusive) at the time of signing ICF;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Being confirmed with COVID-19-Moderate type according to Competent Authority and&#xD;
             Italian Ministry of Health guidelines and to the recommendations reported in Appendix&#xD;
             1 to the present protocol. Based on comprehensive analysis and judgement taking into&#xD;
             account both the epidemiological history and clinical manifestations, the diagnosis is&#xD;
             to be confirmed for suspected cases/clinically diagnosed cases with all of the&#xD;
             following etiological evidences:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Positivity in RT-PCR 2019-nCov test on respiratory tract specimens;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High homology with known gene sequence of 2019-nCov in viral gene sequencing on&#xD;
                  respiratory tract specimens; Note: The above criterion would be subject to any&#xD;
                  update of the Competent Authority and Italian Ministry of Health guidelines and&#xD;
                  to the recommendations reported in Appendix 1 to the present protocol. In case&#xD;
                  any new etiologically detection methods/criteria or any new detectable specimens&#xD;
                  become available after confirmed diagnosis, the new methods or new specimens may&#xD;
                  or may not be used at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Sputum specimen is preferred for RT-PCR test of 2019-nCov nucleic acid; the&#xD;
             specific type of respiratory tract specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower&#xD;
             respiratory tract secretions) is to be selected based on the conditions of the local&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The type of specimen and detection method for 2019-nCov should remain consistent for&#xD;
             the same subject receiving study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Chest imaging (CT as first option or X-ray if CT not possible)-documented pneumonia;&#xD;
             if CT cannot be performed, Pneumonia confirmed by X-ray may be used. The method of&#xD;
             chest imaging pneumonia diagnosis must be consistent all through the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with pyrexia (axillary ≥37℃ or oral ≥37.5℃, or axillary or rectal≥38℃) or&#xD;
             either respiratory rate &gt;24/min and &lt;30/min or cough; For not hospitalized patients,&#xD;
             the Investigator should maintain the detection method consistent all through the study&#xD;
             period. In addition, the Investigator should maintain the data collection and quality&#xD;
             compliant with GCP requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The interval between symptoms onset and randomization is no more than 10 days;&#xD;
             symptoms onset is primarily based on pyrexia, and can be based on cough or other&#xD;
             related symptoms for patients without experiencing pyrexia following onset;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For female subjects: evidence of post-menopause, or, for pre-menopause subjects,&#xD;
             negative pre-treatment serum or urine pregnancy test. Menopause is defined as&#xD;
             amenorrhea for at least 12 months without other medical cause, with the following&#xD;
             age-specific requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For female subjects aged &lt;50 years: menopause for at least 12 months following&#xD;
                  withdrawal of exogenous hormonal therapy, with LH or FSH within the&#xD;
                  post-menopausal ranges, or having undergone any contraceptive surgery (bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy or hysterectomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For female subjects aged ≥50 years: menopause for at least 12 months following&#xD;
                  withdrawal of exogenous hormonal therapy, or having undergone&#xD;
                  radiotherapy-induced oophorectomy with amenorrhea&gt;1 year, or having undergone&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with amenorrhea&gt;1 year, or having undergone any&#xD;
                  contraceptive surgery (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Eligible subjects of child-bearing age (male or female) must agree to take effective&#xD;
             contraceptive measures (including hormonal contraception, barrier methods or&#xD;
             abstinence) with his/her partner during the study period and for at least 7 days&#xD;
             following the last study treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Not participating in any other interventional drug clinical studies before completion&#xD;
             of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Where, in the opinion of the investigator, participation in this study will not be in&#xD;
             the best interest of the subject, or any other circumstances that prevent the subject&#xD;
             from participating in the study safely;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Refractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, inability to&#xD;
             swallow the study drug or having undergone extensive bowel resection which may affect&#xD;
             adequate absorption of Favipiravir;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe liver disease: underlying liver cirrhosis or alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevated over 5 times the ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Gout/history of gout or hyperuricemia (above the ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Oxygen saturation (SPO2)≤93% or arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/ fraction of&#xD;
             inspired O2 (FiO2)≤300 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to Favipiravir;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CcCl) &lt;30 mL/min] or having&#xD;
             received continuous renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis;&#xD;
             CcCl is to be calculated by the following Cockcroft-Gault formula only when the serum&#xD;
             creatinine is&gt;1.5×ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Possibility of the subject being transferred to a non-study hospital within 72h;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant or lactating women;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Having used Favipiravir or participated in any other interventional drug clinical&#xD;
             study within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Considering that COVID-19 requires immediate treatment, absence of severe&#xD;
        hepatic/renal disorders (e.g., cirrhosis, long-term dialysis) in the medical record can be&#xD;
        used as an evidence for eligibility determination. It is recommended that hepatic function&#xD;
        and creatinine be examined whenever possible.&#xD;
