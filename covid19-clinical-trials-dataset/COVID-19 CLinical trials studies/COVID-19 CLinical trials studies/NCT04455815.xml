  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II/III randomised, multi-centre, prospective, open label, community-based&#xD;
      clinical trial. The trial aims to recruit patients who test positive for COVID-19 but who&#xD;
      have mild disease and therefore can treat their symptoms in the community. Patients who seek&#xD;
      testing and have a confirmed positive test result will be invited to enrol in the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a highly&#xD;
      contagious disease with a high and unpredictable morbidity and mortality, for which there is&#xD;
      currently no specific treatment. Progression from a mild fatigue, fever and cough, to severe&#xD;
      respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation may occur 1 to 2 weeks into the disease.&#xD;
      This provides a window of opportunity in which patients in the early phase of the disease&#xD;
      could be treated with a disease-modifying agent, to halt disease progression, prevent&#xD;
      hospital admissions with respiratory failure and prevent death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camostat is a serine protease inhibitor in clinical use in Japan since 1985 to treat patients&#xD;
      with chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and has an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile. Camostat has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into epithelial cells in vitro.&#xD;
      A trial of this repurposed drug for treatment of COVID-19 in humans is urgently required to&#xD;
      assess its impact on disease progression to respiratory failure and whether it can reduce&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has a pilot phase and then a continuation phase. Patients will be randomised into a&#xD;
      treatment arm (camostat tablets) or control arm (best supportive care). Patients will be&#xD;
      called daily at home for 14 days by the clinical trial team to collect symptoms and record&#xD;
      the general well-being of the patient. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if&#xD;
      camostat can reduce the clinical progression of COVID-19 and therefore the need for hospital&#xD;
      admission and supplemental oxygen. Secondary aims include collection of patient reported&#xD;
      health status, severity of symptoms and biological markers of the virus. As the understanding&#xD;
      of COVID-19 develops and improves, the inclusion criteria may be adapted to support the trial&#xD;
      outcomes. Patients will be recruited through various settings which may include primary care&#xD;
      'COVID-19 hub' clinics, COVID-19 community-based testing centres or other clinical&#xD;
      environments.&#xD;

             with trial therapy e.g. mild cognitive impairment (unable to follow instructions for&#xD;
             self-assessment readings as assessed by the Investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on long term supplementary oxygen requirement (patients for whom hospital&#xD;
             admission would not be considered e.g. care plan in the community is in place, are not&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to camostat&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &lt;100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;

             and in discussion with the relevant Chief Investigators and Sponsors and industrial&#xD;
             collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-enrolment involving non-interventional research (including questionnaire or tissue&#xD;
             only studies) will be allowed provided this is not expected to affect the outcomes of&#xD;
             both studies or place undue burden upon participants and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or are already pregnant or&#xD;
             lactating). However, those patients who are of child bearing potential and have a&#xD;
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree to use two forms of&#xD;
             contraception (one effective form plus a barrier method [oral, injected or implanted&#xD;
             hormonal contraception and condom; intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicidal gel and condom]) or agree to sexual abstinence*, effective from the first&#xD;
             administration of camostat, throughout the trial and for 28 days afterwards are&#xD;
             considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this is in&#xD;
        line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
        calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
        acceptable methods of contraception.) 10. Male patients with partners of child-bearing&#xD;
        potential (unless they agree to take measures not to father children by using a barrier&#xD;
        method of contraception [condom plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence* effective from&#xD;
        the first administration of camostat, throughout the trial and for 28 days afterwards. Men&#xD;
        with partners of child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner&#xD;
        uses an effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal&#xD;
        contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual abstinence).&#xD;
        Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier method contraception&#xD;
        (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of the foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this is in&#xD;
        line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
