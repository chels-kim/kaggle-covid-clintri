  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An initial retrospective epidemiological investigation was conducted in a city north of&#xD;
      France after the diagnosis of the first case of COVID-19 on February 2020.&#xD;
      Sero-epidemiological studies were conducted in this town by the Institut Pasteur in early&#xD;
      2020 among families, teachers and non-teaching staff of the high and elementary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this new project is to better characterize the specific immunity generated by the&#xD;
      infection within this community. The specific immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be&#xD;
      followed for a period of 2 years from the initial circulation of the virus, within a large&#xD;
      cohort of participants covering all age groups from 5 years-old onwards. The study will focus&#xD;
      on systemic humoral and cell responses, immunity of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and the humoral&#xD;
      response present in saliva. Follow-up of participants in this cohort and monitoring of the&#xD;
      virus circulation within this community would help to determine the protective character&#xD;
      against re-infection of the natural immunity generated by SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

      An initial retrospective epidemiological investigation was conducted in a city north of&#xD;
      France after the diagnosis of the first case of COVID-19 on February 2020.&#xD;
      Sero-epidemiological studies were conducted in this town by the Institut Pasteur in early&#xD;
      2020 among families, teachers and non-teaching staff of the high and elementary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These surveys have documented the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the first French&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreaks and this study proposes to better characterize the specific immunity&#xD;
      generated by the infection among this community. Indeed, the nature of this immunity and its&#xD;
      persistence over time are crucial information. The goal of this new project is to explore the&#xD;
      specific immune response to the SARS CoV 2 virus for a period of 2 years from the initial&#xD;
      circulation of the virus in this north of France city, within a large cohort of participants&#xD;
      in the general population covering all age groups from 5 years of age but also in patients&#xD;
      and residents of retirement homes in this city. It is expected that the immune response&#xD;
      conferred by natural infection or vaccination will differ according to age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on systemic humoral and cell responses, immunity of the nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      mucosa and the humoral response present in saliva. The genetic basis of the diversity of&#xD;
      humoral responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and those related to the multiplicity of clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of COVID-19 will also be investigated. This would provide initial evidence to&#xD;
      determine the protective character against re-infection of the natural immunity generated by&#xD;
      CoV-2-SARS. Finally, these data will be used to model the intra-family transmission of the&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
