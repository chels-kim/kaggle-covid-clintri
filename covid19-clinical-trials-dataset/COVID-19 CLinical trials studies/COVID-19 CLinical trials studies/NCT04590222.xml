      The principal objective is to determine the impact of phenelzine on the activation phenotype&#xD;
      of T cells and myeloid cells during SARS-CoV2 infection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators want to test in vitro (in France Stage 1), and in vivo in a phase 1b/2 clinical&#xD;
      trial (Stage 2 in Australia) a widely used antidepressant (the monoamine oxidase inhibitor&#xD;
      (MAOi) Phenelzine (Nardil*), repurposed as an antiviral drug to treat SARS-CoV-2. Indeed this&#xD;
      proposal leverages extensive existing data on the epigenetic mechanism of action of&#xD;
      phenelzine and new data suggesting that it has an anti-viral action against the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic drugs are promising antiviral treatments capable of modifying epigenetic tags and&#xD;
      re-programming host and viral genomes. Epigenetic modulation could be useful at least at two&#xD;
      steps: the entry of the virus, and the regulation of the immune response. The SARS-Cov-2&#xD;
      depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to gain cellular entry. The reduction of the expression of these&#xD;
      proteins could therefore be protective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that, in addition to their effects on&#xD;
      neurotransmitter regulation, anti-depressants also possess anti-inflammatory characteristics&#xD;
      via impacting pro inflammatory cytokines production which are involved in the 'cytokines&#xD;
      storm' during severe disease. (2). These patients also have fewer circulating functional T&#xD;
      cells and NK cells and greater numbers of dysfunctional, exhausted CD8+ T cells (3). These&#xD;
      abnormalities are probably deleterious and reduce the efficacy of anti-viral responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-depth and patented epigenetic, cellular, and structural analyses of human cell lines&#xD;
      harbouring the SARS-CoV-2 infective machinery and capable of propagating the virus have shown&#xD;
      that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The epigenetic enzyme (histone demethylase) LSD1 directly regulates the&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2-binding domain of ACE2 and the protease active sites of TMPRSS2 (patented),&#xD;
           which are critical for viral entry and propagation within the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAOi, which target LSD1 activity, inhibit the ACE2/TMPRSS2 machinery, which&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize will prevent viral entry into the host cell to reduce viral&#xD;
           load, disease burden, and the emergence of cytokine storms. In support of novel dual&#xD;
           targeting viral blockage strategy recent work have shown that targeting TMPRSS2 or ACE2&#xD;
           alone has anti-viral activity (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LSD1 inhibition with Phenelzine in recent, successfully completed phase 1B clinical&#xD;
      demonstrate that Phenelzine reverses the dysfunctional T cell phenotype and restores durable&#xD;
      memory responses in vivo in advanced, metastatic breast cancer patients. Importantly, no&#xD;
      adverse impact on healthy volunteer immune systems was recorded as part of the phase 1B&#xD;
      clinical trial (5). Preclinical data shows that aged individuals have exhausted T cells&#xD;
      compared to young individuals and MAOi re-waken these T cells resembling younger people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigators propose that in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, who are&#xD;
      predominantly elderly; where dysfunctional T cells is also a feature, Phenelzine would have&#xD;
      additional benefits on their immune function without adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this proposal exploits a clear mechanism of action of Phenelzine: epigenetic&#xD;
      regulation and is the first study to explore epigenetic mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
      Modulation of the epigenetism could directly counteract the virus via an antiviral effect,&#xD;
      and indirectly via the restoration of a functional immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenelzine has been used for nearly 60 years to treat major depressive disorder. Its&#xD;
      side-effects, most of which are minor, are well characterized, including in the elderly or&#xD;
      immune vulnerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators approach is highly flexible, since LSD1 inhibition targets two immune&#xD;
      mechanisms - a specific viral uptake pathway and the efficacy of T cell responses. Give the&#xD;
      safety and easy applicability of Phenelzine, it lends itself to combinatorial therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches as and when other anti-viral show efficacy. From the mechanistic perspective,&#xD;
      investigators epigenetic approach complements and contextualises genetic studies on COVID-19.&#xD;
