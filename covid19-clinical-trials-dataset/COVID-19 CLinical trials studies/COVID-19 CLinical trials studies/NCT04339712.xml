      Our aim is to conduct one trial of personalized immunotherapy in patients with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) associated with organ dysfunction and with laboratory findings of macrophage&#xD;
      activation syndrome or immune dysregulation. These patients will be selected by the use of a&#xD;
      panel of biomarkers and laboratory findings and they will be allocated to immunotherapy&#xD;
      treatment according to their needs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Humanity is experiencing since November 2019 a new pandemic by the novel SARS Coronavirus-19&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2). As of March 16 2020 170,191 documented case were reported worldwide of which&#xD;
      6,526 died1. The analysis of the clinical characteristics of these patients showed that among&#xD;
      those who were critically ill with acute respiratory failure the risk of death was as high as&#xD;
      60%2. Main clinical feature is the presence of comorbidities and age more than 60 years&#xD;
      whereas main laboratory findings are leukopenia and lymphopenia with hepatic dysfunction and&#xD;
      increase of D-dimers3,4. It is also reported that these patients suffer from intense&#xD;
      pro-inflammation where hyper-cytokinemia predominates5,6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above characteristics lead to consider two main mechanisms of pathogenesis of this&#xD;
      critical condition: macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and immune dysregulation. Early and&#xD;
      correct understanding of the mechanism and management are of prime importance. This can be&#xD;
      achieved only through a therapeutic protocol where the early recognition of the immune state&#xD;
      can be done with the use of biomarkers and with the delivery of the precise treatment aiming&#xD;
      to the correction of the immune dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group indicate that MAS can be diagnosed with reliability&#xD;
      using serum ferritin7. Concentrations greater than 4,420ng/ml possess diagnostic specificity&#xD;
      97.3% and negative predictive value 98%. According to these data, the risk of developing MAS&#xD;
      is greater among patients with comorbidities like type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure&#xD;
      who are prone to hyper-production of interleukin (IL)-1β by tissue macrophages8. A recent&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of patients with severe sepsis and MAS showed that the administration&#xD;
      of anakinra decreased 28-day mortality by 30%9. Anakinra is the recombinant antagonist of&#xD;
      human IL-1β receptor. IL-1β over-production is the hallmark of the pathogenesis of MAS.&#xD;
      Results of a phase III study in 906 patients showed that anakinra was a very safe drug: there&#xD;
      was neither excess mortality nor increased susceptibility to secondary infections9. Since&#xD;
      November 2017 the randomized clinical trial entitled &quot;A trial of validation and restoration&#xD;
      of immune dysfunction in severe infections and sepsis, PROVIDE&quot; (EudraCT number:&#xD;
      2017-002171-26, approval 78/17 by the National Ethics Committee, approval IS 75/17 by the&#xD;
      National Organization for Medicines, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03332225). In this study patients&#xD;
      with sepsis and laboratory diagnosis of MAS are randomized to treatment with placebo or&#xD;
      anakinra for seven days. Enrolment was completed in December 2019 and no drug related adverse&#xD;
      events have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent unpublished data of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group demonstrate that patients with&#xD;
      immune dysregulation have profound lymphopenia associated with elevated IL-6. This is in&#xD;
      accordance with evidence of the H1N1 pandemic where patients with pneumonia had substantial&#xD;
      lymphopenia and increased Τ regulatory lymphocytes (Treg). This increase of Τreg was&#xD;
      prominent among patients with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure and&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease10,11. The IL-6 blocker tocilizumab is a promising&#xD;
      candidate for the reversal of this immune dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESCAPE is an address to the personalized management of life-threatening organ dysfunction by&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. More precisely, patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 associated with MAS and immune&#xD;
      dysregulation will be administered treatment with anakinra and tocilizumab respectively.&#xD;
