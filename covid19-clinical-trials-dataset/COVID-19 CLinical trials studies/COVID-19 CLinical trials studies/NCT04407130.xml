      Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported from Wuhan, China in&#xD;
      early December 2019.Presently known to be caused by a novel beta-corona virus, named as&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on March.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnoea&#xD;
      and pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infected individuals exhibit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mostly mild illness (80% +) recover without any treatment (~80%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate illness that needs hospitalization and recovers after standard&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. supportive treatment (~14%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Critical illness (~5%) needs ICU support&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Death (1-2% )&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 has now spread &gt;210 countries and territories globally. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory&#xD;
      virus which spreads primarily through droplets generalized when an infected person coughs or&#xD;
      sneezes or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic management remains the mainstay of treatment strategy. Mortality appears to be&#xD;
      more common in older individuals and those with co-morbidities, such as chronic lung disease,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Young people with no comorbidities also appear to be at&#xD;
      risk for critical illness including multi-organ failure and death. Seen more in Bangladesh&#xD;
      between 21-40 yrs of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no specific treatment against this new virus that WHO has officially declared until&#xD;
      now.There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19. National Guidelines on Clinical Management of Corona virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19):&#xD;
      V 5.0 date 9th April 2020) CDC, DGHS, GoB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus an RCT is urgently needed in Bangladesh: Based on recent literatures on Rx studies in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients from other countries as well as its availability &amp; affordability of those&#xD;
      repurposed medicines&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of ivermectin in combination with&#xD;
      doxycycline or ivermectin alone for the treatment of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected adult&#xD;
      Bangladeshi COVID-19 +ve patients and to compare with placebo; where all three arms will&#xD;
      receive the standard care of treatment of COVID-19 infected patients in the hospital. By&#xD;
      successful demonstration of the safety and efficacy of these repurposed medicines, it may&#xD;
      have the potential to play an important role in the treatment of COVID-19+ve patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Duration of the virological clearance rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Days required for remission of fever and cough&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients requiring oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients failing to maintain SpO2 &gt;88 despite oxygenation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days on oxygen support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cause mortality&#xD;
