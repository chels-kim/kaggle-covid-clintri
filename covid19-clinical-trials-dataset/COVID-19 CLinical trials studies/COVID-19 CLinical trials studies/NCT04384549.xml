  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare Workers (HCW) are at high risk for COVID-19. In addition to the risk of serious&#xD;
      forms among HCW, significant absenteeism due to illness would have dramatic consequences in&#xD;
      our ability to fight COVID-19. No coronavirus vaccine is available today and drug treatments&#xD;
      are only at the start of clinical evaluation. Available since 1921, the bacillus Calmette and&#xD;
      Guérin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccine in the world (&gt; 3 billion doses administered)&#xD;
      with an extremely low rate of adverse effects. BCG is indicated for the prevention of&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB), but more recent studies have shown that it also has nonspecific immune&#xD;
      properties which may be interesting in the current COVID-19 epidemic. Data in mice and in&#xD;
      humans have demonstrated protection conferred by BCG against viral respiratory infections&#xD;
      such as influenza. In countries with high endemic TB, BCG decreases the incidence of acute&#xD;
      respiratory infections by up to 80%, neonatal BCG vaccination has been shown to greatly&#xD;
      reduce the risk of sepsis and of hospitalization of children for reasons other than TB. A&#xD;
      recent study conducted in South Africa showed that re-vaccination with BCG in adults reduced&#xD;
      the incidence of respiratory infections by 70% compared to unvaccinated controls. Beyond&#xD;
      respiratory infections, BCG has also shown protective effects against inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
      These non-specific beneficial effects are likely linked to the induction of &quot;trained innate&#xD;
      immunity&quot;, implying epigenetic and metabolic re-programming of innate immune cells. It is&#xD;
      therefore possible that revaccination with BCG could significantly reduce the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of COVID-19. Very recent ecological observations indeed suggest an inverse&#xD;
      correlation between BCG vaccination coverage and the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. In&#xD;
      this context several trials began in Europe and Australia to evaluate the efficacy of BCG&#xD;
      vaccination in populations at risk of exposure (HCW) or severe disease (elderly). This study&#xD;
      is aligned with studies carried out in Australia, The Netherlands and Spain. In contrast to&#xD;
      these latter studies, virtually all French study participants have been vaccinated in their&#xD;
      childhood, since BCG vaccination was mandatory in France in neonates until 2007, and in HCW&#xD;
      until recently. Therefore, the French study will be in a unique situation to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of re-vaccination with BCG in the context of BCG priming decades before revaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multicenter phase III controlled trial, in 2 parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group vaccinated with BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group receiving placebo (0.9 % saline) Randomization in a 1: 1 ratio will be&#xD;
           stratified on the center. The study will be proposed to all heath care workers eligible.&#xD;
           At screening, the investigator will propose the study to the participant and explain the&#xD;
           details by providing an information letter. After signature of the consent, evaluations&#xD;
           specific for the study will be undertaken, such as clinical examination, blood sampling,&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal sampling in case of clinical signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the inclusion visit, participants corresponding to the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive BCG or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single dose of BCG vaccine (or placebo). The adult dose of BCG&#xD;
      vaccine (or placebo) is 0.1 mL injected intradermally over the distal insertion of the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle onto the humerus (approximately one third down the upper arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be done respectively at M3 and M6 and phone contacts between these two&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected prior to randomization (V0) and at 3 and 6 months to&#xD;
      determine exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Where&#xD;
      required, swab/blood samples will be taken at illness episodes to assess SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 6 months with regular mobile phone text messages 2 times&#xD;
      weekly to collect local and general reactions until 30 days after vaccination and during the&#xD;
      study to identify and detail COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological studies will be conducted at a central Laboratory. Analysis will take place&#xD;
      after M6 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested study will be carried out on blood samples of 72 study subjects in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of COVID-19 on innate immunity. These blood samples will be collected at M6 among&#xD;
      6 groups, each containing 12 study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of subjects vaccinated with BCG that have remained sero-negative for SARS CoV2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of subjects having received placebo that have remained sero-negative for SARS&#xD;
           CoV2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of symptomatic subjects vaccinated with BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of symptomatic subjects having received placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group without symptoms but sero-positive for SARS CoV2 vaccinated with BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group without symptoms but sero-positive for SARS CoV2 vaccinated with placebo&#xD;
