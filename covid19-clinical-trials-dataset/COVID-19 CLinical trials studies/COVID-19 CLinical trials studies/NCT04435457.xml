  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of December of 2019, a series of patients in Wuhan, China were struck with a&#xD;
      mysterious respiratory infection. These isolated events have rapidly grown into a deadly,&#xD;
      global pandemic. This pandemic is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#xD;
      2 (SARS-CoV-2), which results in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). For individuals&#xD;
      infected with COVID-19, approximately 30% of the hospitalized cases are associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications. Data are emerging that individuals with pre-exiting conditions&#xD;
      (like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or medical issues related to the immune system) are&#xD;
      most susceptible to complications related to COVID-19. Furthermore, individuals of certain&#xD;
      racial and ethnic backgrounds (e.g. African American and Hispanic) are at a higher risk of&#xD;
      death from COVID-19. Despite these emerging observations, it remains unclear who will develop&#xD;
      the cardiovascular complications (acute myocardial injury with evidence of a myocarditis-like&#xD;
      picture and cardiogenic shock) and what the long term sequelae of this disease will be for&#xD;
      survivors of this infection after hospitalization. Thus, the goals of this project are to&#xD;
      better understand the epidemiology of cardiac injury in acutely ill COVID-19 patients through&#xD;
      deep cardiac phenotyping and identify the molecular profile of individuals most susceptible&#xD;
      to cardiac injury from COVID-19.&#xD;

      This will be a cross-sectional cohort study of participants who will undergo a detailed&#xD;
      cardiovascular imaging evaluation and blood draw once they have recuperated from a prior&#xD;
      index-hospitalization at Clements University Hospital or Parkland Memorial Hospital in&#xD;
      Dallas, Texas, USA for COVID-19 and are no longer contagious (~4-6 weeks post&#xD;
      hospitalization). Due to the uncertainty with which the extent of cardiac injury represents&#xD;
      phenotypic cardiac manifestations in COVID-19, the investigators plan to enroll individuals&#xD;
      according to their highest, in-hospital, (high sensitivity - cardiac troponin T) hs-cTnT. The&#xD;
      following proposed stratification scheme will afford testing a spectrum hs-cTnT levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table: Enrollment strata by hs-cTnT (N=70)&#xD;
&#xD;
      hs-cTnT [ng/L] &lt; 50 50-100 101-500 &gt; 500&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment N=20 N=20 N=20 N=10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the following exploratory protocol for deep phenotyping to&#xD;
      characterize surviving patients with COVID-19 and elevated hs-cTnT during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a protocolized multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (CMR) assessment with an electrocardiography-gated breath hold protocol under the&#xD;
      oversight of study personnel and read by a reader blinded to hs-cTnT data from the COVID-19&#xD;
      index hospitalization. Conventional 1H CMR evaluations will include T2 maps, native and&#xD;
      post-contrast T1 maps, as well as extracellular volume index calculation and late gadolinium&#xD;
      for inflammatory injury. Standardized adenosine hyperemic stress perfusion CMR will be&#xD;
      performed for quantitative myocardial blood flow analysis. In addition to conventional 1H CMR&#xD;
      a subset of 5 patients from the highest and lowest troponin groups, age- and BMI-matched,&#xD;
      will undergo hyperpolarized 13C metabolic CMR with infusion of [1-13C] pyruvate under fasting&#xD;
      conditions to assess inflammation and post carbohydrate load to assess a decrease in&#xD;
      myocardial mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biospecimens will be collected by study personnel at the time of CMR or preliminary study&#xD;
      site visit. A fasting venous blood sample (50 cc) will be collected, maintained on ice and&#xD;
      transported to the Mammen Laboratory, which is located on the campus of UT Southwestern. Both&#xD;
      serum and plasma will be isolated and aliquoted for storage and immediately frozen and stored&#xD;
      until use and will not undergo any freeze-thaw cycles. RNA and protein will be extracted from&#xD;
      the samples for biomarker and autoantibody (AAb) assays. The presence of cardiac-specific&#xD;
      AAbs has been shown to be involved in both the manifestation and development of cardiac&#xD;
      disease manifestation and predicting disease development. Utilizing a customized ELISA-based&#xD;
      detection assay, ~20 circulating cardiac-specific AAbs that have been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with heart failure will be assessed and quantified during the early (1-2 months&#xD;
      post-hospitalization) phases of the patient post COVID-19 hospitalization course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukocytes will be isolated from the biospecimens samples and genomic DNA will be extracted&#xD;
      from the cells to perform Next Generation Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). These studies will be&#xD;
      undertaken in the Next-Generation Sequencing Core on campus. Capitalizing on a&#xD;
      well-established research collaboration between the Mammen Laboratory and the McDermott&#xD;
      bioinformatics group, the WES data will be analyzed for genetic mutations associated with&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy as well as autoimmunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If funds are available, both the imaging and molecular assessments will be duplicated in&#xD;
      individuals with paired data after an additional 10-12 months from hospitalization.&#xD;
