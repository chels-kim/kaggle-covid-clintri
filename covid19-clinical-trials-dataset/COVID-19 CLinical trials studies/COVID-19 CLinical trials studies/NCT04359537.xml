  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine has been approved by FDA as one of the treatment options for COVID&#xD;
      19.Healthcare personnel are amongst those at highest risk to contract the disease. Several&#xD;
      health authorities are now recommending the use of hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis is in health care personnel. Several studies are on going in this context.&#xD;
      However there is a controversy regarding the dosage regimen. This drug has a half life of&#xD;
      22.4 days. In this study we will be comparing three different doses of Hydroxychloroquine and&#xD;
      additionally have a control group in order to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as&#xD;
      pre- exposure prophylaxis in healthcare personnel in various doses.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 proof of concept study Study Type: Interventional (Clinical Trial) Estimated&#xD;
      Enrollment : at least 200 participants Since the investigators have no current data on&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis to calculate sample size statistically, so a minimum of 50&#xD;
      participants in each arm will be recruited including 20% attrition rate. The investigators&#xD;
      will be recruiting a minimum of 200 participants in the study , that is at least 50 in each&#xD;
      of the four arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation: Randomized Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Study model: Parallel group&#xD;
      interventional study Location: SZABMU/PIMS Study duration: a minimum of 12 weeks from&#xD;
      recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited after approval from Ethical Review Board .A written informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken from all participants. Participants fulfilling the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized to 4 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm Intervention /treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group 1: Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice a day 1,followed by 400 mg weekly for a&#xD;
      total of 12 weeks Drug: Hydroxychloroquin HCQ 200 mg, oral&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group 2:Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg on day 1 followed by 400mg once every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for a total of 12 weeks Drug: Hydroxychloroquin HCQ 200 mg, oral&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group 3:Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg on day 1 followed by 200 mg once every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for a total of 12 weeks Drug: Hydroxychloroquin HCQ 200 mg, oral&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group : Placebo 200mg will be given on day 1 followed by Placebo 200mg every three&#xD;
      weeks for a total of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Base line characteristics of all participants will be recorded including age ,gender,role of&#xD;
      healthcare personnel, comorbidities, and drugs the participant is using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected for complete picture blood, liver and renal function tests and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. These tests will also be conducted every month till the end of the trial&#xD;
      and the participants will be monitored for any adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study duration all participants will self- report any symptoms related to COVID 19&#xD;
      and any adverse reactions from the drug. Participants having COVID 19 symptoms at any time&#xD;
      will be tested by the gold standard test PCR for SARS-COV-2 using nasopharyngeal and&#xD;
      oropharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants at the end of the study will have PCR for SARS-COV-2 and if available IgM&#xD;
      and IgG serology to find out if they had any infection, did not get infected at all or only&#xD;
      had asymptomatic or mild infection.&#xD;
