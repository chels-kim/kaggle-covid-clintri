  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by inability of the heart to&#xD;
      pump an adequate amount of blood. Heart failure affects patients' ability to carry out even&#xD;
      simple activities of daily living and therefore has negative psychological impact. Many&#xD;
      studies reported that depression is prevalent among HF patients and it is being associated&#xD;
      with high morbidity, mortality and costs. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines&#xD;
      stresses the importance of routine depression screening with a validated questionnaire and&#xD;
      initiating treatment for depression for all depressed HF patients and their access to&#xD;
      psychological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The community heart failure nurses provide the integrated heart failure service in the local&#xD;
      area of Southwark and Lambeth in South London. The aim of the integrated heart failure team&#xD;
      in the community is to provide the HF treatment effectively, help patients understand and&#xD;
      manage their symptoms and support with lifestyle changes. Even though, the community HF&#xD;
      nurses have extensive role in managing HF patients in the community, their role in assessing&#xD;
      anxiety and depressionÍ¾ and providing psychological treatment needs to be further explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to assess the process by which community HF nurses assess and&#xD;
      manage anxiety and depression. This current study builds on our recent systematic review&#xD;
      which illustrated how cognitive behaviour therapy is effective at improving depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in HF, but more studies are needed to build on these findings. The findings from&#xD;
      this review will be used to examine the perspectives on assessing, managing and treating&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current study, an online focus group with community heart failure nurses and&#xD;
      qualitative telephone/online interviews with community-based HF patients will be undertaken&#xD;
      to explore their views and experiences in managing depression and anxiety; and to assess&#xD;
      whether COMPASS a web-based intervention would be useful. Also, this study will explore the&#xD;
      impact of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of community-based HF patients.&#xD;

    <description>COMPASS is a web-based intervention (online CBT program) that was developed for managing illness-related anxiety and depression in patients with long-term conditions (LTC) (https://compass-ltc.org/). COMPASS is tailored to gain an understanding of the difficulties that LTC patients experience and provide information and tools on how to manage these. This qualitative study will explore participants' perspectives on using COMPASS for managing depression and anxiety in heart failure.</description>
