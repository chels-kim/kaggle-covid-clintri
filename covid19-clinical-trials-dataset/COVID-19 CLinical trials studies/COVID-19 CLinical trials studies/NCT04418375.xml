  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the COVID-HOP study is to identify biological and non-biological markers&#xD;
      associated to: a positive or negative serology anti SRAS-Cov-2; a positive serology and&#xD;
      having presented symptoms or, on the contrary, not having had symptoms; the persistence of&#xD;
      immunity or the loss of this immunity over time; the protective nature of the presence of&#xD;
      anti SRAS-Cov-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, a biological collection (serum, plasma, DNA, RNA, mono-nucleated&#xD;
      cells and urine) and a collection of detailed clinical data during the serological screening&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 of hospital agents (medical and non-medical staff) of the Assistance Publique&#xD;
      Hôpitaux de Paris (Paris, France) will be carried out. 4000 professionals in 5 hospitals will&#xD;
      be included. As part of the research, the anti SRAS-CoV-2 serology will be monitored 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months after the initial serology. Numerous studies will be carried out from this&#xD;
      biological collection and from the database to answer the primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To answer the questions raised in the primary and secondary endpoints, a biological&#xD;
      collection (serum, plasma, DNA, RNA, mono-nucleated cells and urine) and a collection of&#xD;
      detailed data by the mean of a questionnaire (demographic, clinical, lifestyle, professional&#xD;
      exposure to the virus, COVID-19 infection with detailed symptoms and complications) during&#xD;
      the serological screening for SARS-CoV-2 of hospital agents (medical and non-medical staff)&#xD;
      of the Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris (Paris, France) will be carried out. 4000&#xD;
      professionals in 5 hospitals of the Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris. As part of the&#xD;
      research, the anti SRAS-CoV-2 serology will be monitored 6 months (M6) and 12 months (M12)&#xD;
      after the initial serology and a brief questionnaire (update regarding treatments,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, and COVID-19 infection) will be fulfilled at these two time points. Of note,&#xD;
      if the inclusion could not be performed during the initial serological screening, the&#xD;
      professional will be recalled to be included at M6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The analysis of the determinants independently associated with&#xD;
      symptomatic COVID + status will be carried out by uni- and multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
      The internal validation will be carried out by methods of draw with discount (bootstrap). The&#xD;
      performance of the model will include calibration (graphical method) and discrimination&#xD;
      (AUC). The biomarker study will include the study of the association with COVID + symptomatic&#xD;
      versus asymptomatic status by univariate then multivariate analyzes (logistic regression)&#xD;
      including clinical variables. The additional value of biomarkers will be studied by comparing&#xD;
      the discriminating power of clinical models with and without the new biomarker. Finally, the&#xD;
      study of the heterogeneity of COVID + symptomatic and asymptomatic patients will be carried&#xD;
      out by an unsupervised analysis of Machine Learning known as archetypes.&#xD;
