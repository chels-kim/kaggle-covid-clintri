  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to observe how often antibiotics are prescribed in children hospitalized for&#xD;
      pneumonia and how doctors decide if a child needs antibiotics or not. Parent satisfaction&#xD;
      will also be recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An observational study to document the antibiotic treatment rate of children hospitalized for&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia at a pediatric department with longstanding practice of&#xD;
      restrictive antibiotic prescribing. Patients will be enrolled consecutively and treated&#xD;
      according to in-house standard operating procedure. Antibiotic treatment rate, severity of&#xD;
      disease and medical complication rate in antibiotic and non-antibiotic managed children,&#xD;
      frequency of predefined factors in physician decision making on antibiotic use, and parental&#xD;
      satisfaction will be recorded. Parents will be contacted at least 4 weeks after discharge to&#xD;
      inquire about recurrence or readmission.&#xD;
