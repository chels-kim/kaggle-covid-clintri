  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Burkholdria spp, Aspergillus in the lung are almost&#xD;
      impossible to eradicate with conventional antibiotics. In addition COVID-19 has know current&#xD;
      treatment. These patients have few options to treat their lung infection. Nitric oxide has&#xD;
      broad bactericidal and virucidal properties. It has been shown that nitric oxide was safe to&#xD;
      be inhaled for similar cystic fibrosis patients and reduced drug resistant bacteria in the&#xD;
      lungs. Further, research indicates that clinical isolates of NTM, Burkholderia spp,&#xD;
      Aspergillus spp and Corona-like viruses can be eradicated by 160ppm NO exposure in the&#xD;
      laboratory petri dish. This is not the first time inhaled NO treatment has been used in&#xD;
      patients with difficult lung infections. This study will provide more data to see if NO&#xD;
      therapy can reduce the bacterial load in the lungs, help the patients breath better; and in&#xD;
      the case of COVID-19 act as a anti-viral agent resulting in the reduction of incidence of&#xD;
      oxygen therapy, mechanical assistance of BIPAP, CPAP, intubation and mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;

      Main Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Assess the safety of inhaled NO (gNO) in adults &amp; adolescents with NTM,&#xD;
      Burkholderia, Aspergillus Lung Infections and Viral Lung (COVID-19) Infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by unanticipated adverse events in clinical labs (hematology,&#xD;
      coagulation, and serum chemistries); in vitals; in inspired concentration of NO, O2 and NO2&#xD;
      delivered to each subject and; in real time methemoglobin and oxygen saturation levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the safety of gNO in the NTM population,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as confirmed by no unanticipated adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of a deleterious mean change in FEV1% predicted (absolute) from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary safety Endpoint: Determine the efficacy of inhaled NO in adults with NTM,&#xD;
      Burkholderia and Aspergillus Lung Infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the change in lung function with spirometry&#xD;
      (specifically absolute change in FEV1 % predicted) from baseline to Days 5, 12, 19 and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Determine the presence of an efficacy signal of gNO in the NTM,&#xD;
      Burkholderia and Aspergillus Lung Infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by the antimicrobial effect of inhaled NO on the density of NTM&#xD;
      species and other microorganisms in sputum. Serial measurements of these microbial colony&#xD;
      counts in sputum have been previously used as a measure of antimicrobial activity in other&#xD;
      clinical trials of antibiotics in NTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • as confirmed by an improvement in pre-treatment bacterial colonization and post-treatment&#xD;
      bacterial colonization on Days 19 and 26 as compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by change in Quality of Life Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as assessed by an improvement in CRISS Score on Day 5, 19 and 26 as compared to baseline&#xD;
           measurement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as determined by improvement in six-minute walk test with one minute recovery as&#xD;
           compared to baseline measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Substudy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated by measuring reduction in the incidence of mechanical assistance&#xD;
      of BIPAP, CPAP, intubation and mechanical ventilation during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients with mild COVID2019 who deteriorate to a severe form of the&#xD;
           disease requiring mechanical intervention like BIPAP/CPAP, intubation and mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mortality from all causes during the study period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Negative conversion of COVID-19 RT-PCR from upper respiratory tract measured as the&#xD;
           proportion of patients with a negative conversion of RT-PCR from an oropharyngeal or a&#xD;
           nasopahryngeal swab;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time to clinical recovery defined as the time from initiation of the study to discharge&#xD;
           or to normalization of fever (defined as &lt;36.6°C from axillary site, or &lt; 37.2°C from&#xD;
           oral site or &lt; 37.8°C from rectal or tympanic site), respiratory rate (&lt; 24 bpm while&#xD;
           breathing room air);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Alleviation of symptoms recorded in the Modified Jackson Cols score with particular&#xD;
           definition of cough (defined as mild or absent in a patient reported scale of severity).&#xD;
