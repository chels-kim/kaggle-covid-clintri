  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical institutions that enroll patients with corona virus disease 2019, three arms,&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized and controlled methods are adopted. Patients are divided into three&#xD;
      groups, favipiravir combined with tocilizumab group, favipiravir group and tocilizumab group.&#xD;
      150 patients are expected to be enrolled and the cases are allocated according to the ratio&#xD;
      of 3( favipiravir combined with tocilizumab group): 1(favipiravir group): 1(tocilizumab&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
