  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unlike other respiratory viruses such as influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)&#xD;
      where the child is the essential reservoir and central vector of intrafamilial contamination,&#xD;
      the child is likely to be a small player in the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SRAS-CoV2) infection. This study aims to describe the age category of&#xD;
      the first contact, within 14 days before the appearance of the first symptoms of the index&#xD;
      case in order to describe the age categories of this first contaminant, globally, in the&#xD;
      group of children and finally in the group of adults. This work is intended to provide food&#xD;
      for discussion and to justify the distancing and containment measures imposed on children&#xD;
      when their isolation has a deleterious impact that has now been established for some&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children after hospitalized in Hospices Civils de Lyon with Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
             (PCR) positive SARS-CoV2,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adults hospitalized in Hospices Civils de Lyon and included in the NOSO-COR study with&#xD;
             matching criteria described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Matching will be performed on family age characteristics and on the period of&#xD;
                  contamination included in the containment period to minimize bias, and if&#xD;
                  possible frequency matching according to admission in Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
                  ICU/Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), and to family structure (n of children&#xD;
                  / n of adults in the family).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any patient suspected of nosocomial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any patient death during the Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any adult patient without children living home.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Opposition to participate.&#xD;
