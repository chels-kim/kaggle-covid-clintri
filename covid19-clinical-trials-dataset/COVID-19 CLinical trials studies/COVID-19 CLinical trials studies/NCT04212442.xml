      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an adapted&#xD;
      version of the Function Focused Care intervention, delivered by telephone, for improving&#xD;
      aging in place for older adults living in subsidized housing. The study will include&#xD;
      participants with and without mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and will examine&#xD;
      whether the study outcomes differ by cognitive status. Findings from this study will provide&#xD;
      new information about how to optimize function and physical activity among older adults with&#xD;
      and without cognitive impairment living in subsidized housing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Millions of older adults with low incomes live in federally-subsidized housing and are at&#xD;
      disproportionate risk for nursing home admission. Effective approaches for improving aging in&#xD;
      place for this vulnerable population are needed. The objective of this study is to pilot test&#xD;
      the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a telephone-based intervention to improve&#xD;
      aging in place for older adults living in subsidized housing. In the first phase of this&#xD;
      study, the investigators used methods of implementation science to adapt an existing&#xD;
      intervention, Function Focused Care for Assisted Living, to the unique setting of affordable&#xD;
      housing. Function Focused Care is a philosophy of care in which assisted living staff members&#xD;
      engage residents in functional and physical activity during all care interactions. Prior&#xD;
      research supports the effectiveness of Function Focused Care for maintaining function and&#xD;
      increasing physical activity among older adults in assisted living settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of this study, the investigators interviewed subsidized housing&#xD;
      stakeholders - including residents, staff members, and caregivers - to identify barriers,&#xD;
      facilitators, and needed adaptations to Function Focused Care for Assisted Living. The&#xD;
      investigators used the findings from these interviews to adapt the intervention. In this&#xD;
      2-month pilot study, the investigators will use a wait-list control design with site&#xD;
      randomization to assess the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the adapted&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will recruit individuals with and without mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment or mild dementia and will examine whether the study outcomes differ by cognitive&#xD;
      status. The findings from this study will provide new information about how to optimize&#xD;
      function and physical activity among older adults with and without cognitive impairment&#xD;
      living in subsidized housing.&#xD;

    <description>Two-month program intended to increase physical activity and function, including the following 4 steps:&#xD;
Environmental and Policy Assessments: Nurse facilitator works with the affordable housing staff to identify and recommend feasible interventions to alter the environment, policy, and procedures to optimize resident function and physical activity.&#xD;
Education: Nurse educates residents and study partners in the principles of the Independent Living Program, using established materials and adult learning techniques.&#xD;
Establishing Resident Goals: The nurse completes Capability Assessment Forms and helps resident set goals to increase function and physical activity.&#xD;
The nurse helps to motivate and mentor residents and study partners to achieve and maintain their goals, using evidence-based approaches.</description>
