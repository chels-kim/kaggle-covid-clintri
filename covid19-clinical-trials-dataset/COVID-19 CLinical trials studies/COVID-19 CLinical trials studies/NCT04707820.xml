  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is causing a global pandemic and a major health crisis in&#xD;
      France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunity is the body's ability to defend itself against infectious agents such as viruses.&#xD;
      The progressive acquisition by a large part of the population of immunity to defend itself&#xD;
      against the COVID-19 virus is one of the main mechanisms by which a resolution of this&#xD;
      pandemic is hoped for. Recovery from infection and protection from the virus is likely to&#xD;
      depend on the development of antibodies (proteins produced by the body to neutralize&#xD;
      infectious agents) and T-cells (a type of white blood cell in the immune system) that can&#xD;
      stop the virus from multiplying and killing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the way and speed at which the T-lymphocytes active against the virus appear are not&#xD;
      known. The development of biological tests to detect T-cells active against the virus in the&#xD;
      blood of infected patients is therefore necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we propose you to participate in a study that will study the immune system's&#xD;
      response against the sars-CoV-2 virus during and after COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>ELISPOT</intervention_name>
    <description>The evolution of the number of gamma interferon (IFN) producing T lymphocytes in response to Spike glycoprotein (Spike glycoprotein) will be assessed by enumeration in ELISPOT method at 4 measurement times: D0 (confirmation of infection by PCR), D+7, D+14 or at hospital departure (D+Departure) and D+56±14 days.&#xD;
The ELISPOT method consists in stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (isolated by density gradient and containing a known CD3+ T lymphocyte count) over a short period of time (16 to 20 hours) with a pool of 15 amino acid peptides (overlapping on 11 amino acids) representative of the S protein.</description>
