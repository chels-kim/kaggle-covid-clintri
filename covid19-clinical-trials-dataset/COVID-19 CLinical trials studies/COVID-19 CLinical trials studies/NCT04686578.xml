  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia; as a chronic syndrome of unknown cause with widespread body pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      sleep disorder, cognitive impairment and anxiety. Many studies have shown a relationship&#xD;
      between pain levels and anxiety levels in patients with fibromyalgia. Covid-19 started from&#xD;
      Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread worldwide. The rapid spread of this unexpected&#xD;
      pandemic all over the world brought with it many conditions such as anxiety and stress&#xD;
      disorders. It has been reported by experts that individuals with a predisposition to&#xD;
      conditions such as anxiety and stress disorder in premorbidity require special attention.To&#xD;
      evaluate the psychological effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Covid-19 anxiety scale was&#xD;
      developed from Lee et al. and the Covid-19 fear scale was developed from Ahoursou et al. The&#xD;
      investigators planned to analyzed the effect on Covid-19 fear and anxiety level on&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patients' daily life with revised Fibromyalgia Impact questionnaire, sleep&#xD;
      quality with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and anxiety-depression level with The Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression scale. This study was planned as a cross-sectional case control study.&#xD;

    <description>It is evaluated by the Coronavirus anxiety scale (CAS). It was developed by Lee et al. and Evren et al. were made validity and reliability of this scale in Turkish. It is 5-items scale, and each item scores between 0-4. The total score (ranging from 0 to 20) is calculated by adding up each item score. The higher the score, the greater the anxiety associated with coronavirus-19. Level of Covid-19 anxiety will be compared between fibromyalgia and control groups.</description>

    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>It is evaluated with The Fear Covid-19 Scale which was developed by Ahorsu et al., and it was adapted into Turkish. It is 7-item scale, each item scores with 5-pont Likert scale. Total score is 35, and the higher score describe higher fear level. Level of Covid-19 fear will be compared between fibromyalgia and control groups.</description>

    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The daily life of fibromyalgia patients will be analyzed with Fibromyalgia Impact questionnaire (FIQ). It has 21 individual questions. All questions are based on an 11-point numeric rating scale of 0 to 10. It is divided three domains: function, over impact, symptoms. The summed score for function (range 0 to 90) is divided by 3, the summed score or overall impact (range 0 to 20) is not changed, and the summed score for symptoms (range 0 to 100) is divided by 2. The total score is the sum of the three modified domain scores, and total score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate worse daily life.&#xD;
Investigators will be analyzed the relationship between CAS, the fear Covid-19 Scale, and the FIQ.</description>

    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score.The total score ranges from 0-21. A total score greater than 5 indicates &quot;poor sleep quality&quot; Investigators will be analyzed the relationship between CAS, the fear Covid-19 Scale, and the PSQI.</description>

    <description>The anxiety and depression level will be evaluated with Hospital anxiety-and depression scale (HADS).The purpose of the scale is not to make a diagnosis. The scale is a self-report scale and consists of 14 questions, 7 of which investigate depression, and 7 of which investigate anxiety of patients.</description>
