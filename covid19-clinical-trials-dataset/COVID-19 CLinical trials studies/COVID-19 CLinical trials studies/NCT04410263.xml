    <textblock>
      In light of the rapidly emerging pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the global population and&#xD;
      health care systems are facing unprecedented challenges through the combination of&#xD;
      transmission and the potential for severe disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      has been found with unusual clinical features dominated by substantial alveolar fluid load.&#xD;
      It is unknown whether this is primarily caused by endothelial dysfunction leading to&#xD;
      capillary leakage or direct virus induced damage. This knowledge gap is significant because&#xD;
      the initial balance between fluid management and circulatory support appear to be decisive.&#xD;
      On progression of the disease, bacterial superinfection facilitated by inflammation and virus&#xD;
      related damage, has been identified as the main factor for patient outcome, but the role of&#xD;
      the host versus the environment microbiome remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of the present research proposal is to improve therapeutic strategies in&#xD;
      critically ill patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by advancing the&#xD;
      pathophysiological understanding of this novel disease. This research thus focuses on&#xD;
      inflammation, microcirculatory dysfunction and superinfection, aiming to elucidate risk&#xD;
      factors (RF) for the development of severe ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and&#xD;
      contribute to the rationale for therapeutic strategies. The hypotheses are that (I) the&#xD;
      primary damage to the lung in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS is mediated through an exaggerated&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory response causing primary endothelial dysfunction, and subsequently acting&#xD;
      two-fold on the degradation of the lung parenchyma - through the primary cytokine response,&#xD;
      and through recruitment of the inflammatory-monocyte-lymphocyte-neutrophil axis. The&#xD;
      pronounced inflammation and primary damage to the lung disrupts the pulmonary microbiome,&#xD;
      leading secondarily to pulmonary superinfections. (II) Pulmonary bacterial superinfections&#xD;
      are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Pathogen&#xD;
      colonization main Risk Factor for lower respiratory tract infections. To establish&#xD;
      colonization, pathogens have to interact with the local microbiota (a.k.a. microbiome) and&#xD;
      certain microbiome profiles will be more resistant to pathogen invasion. Finally, (III)&#xD;
      Handheld devices used in clinical routine are a potential reservoir and carrier of both,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, as well as bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, severe pneumonia cases were reported in relation to the Huanan Seafood&#xD;
      Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. Four months and more than thousand deaths later, the&#xD;
      responsible pathogen of the largest and most critical global health emergency in the last 100&#xD;
      years is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized as a transmittable disease with a long&#xD;
      incubation period of between 7 and 14 days. In around 10% of cases a severe disease course is&#xD;
      observed. While predisposing factors such as older age, chronic arterial hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, as well as other comorbidities have been described, little is known about the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism, which induce acute lung failure, coupled to the often-appearing&#xD;
      heart, kidney and vascular injury pathognomonic for the deadly course of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alveolar exudative and interstitial inflammation impairing alveolo-capillary gas exchange&#xD;
      described in relation to SARS-CoV-2 complies with the definition of acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS). The pathophysiological mechanics behind this injury to the lung&#xD;
      have been best described in bacterial sepsis induced ARDS, and are mainly induced by the&#xD;
      extravasation of neutrophil granulocytes from the capillary vasculature into the lung. One of&#xD;
      the main mediators of neutrophil extravasation is the degeneration of the endothelial surface&#xD;
      layer, namely the glycocalyx, induced by endotoxin-activated heparan sulfate. The thinning&#xD;
      and destructuration of the glycocalyx reveal hidden endothelial surface adhesion molecules&#xD;
      like VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. The thereby increased adhesion of Neutrophils coupled to the&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine mediated dis-placement of VE-cadherin to the insides of the endothelial&#xD;
      cells, loosening the endothelial tight junctions, allows for an increased extravasation of&#xD;
      neutrophils and diffusion of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium. The thereby created&#xD;
      milieu induces neutrophil granulocytes activation and degranulation, and provokes the release&#xD;
      of toxic mediators that destroy the alveolar epithelium and produce further immunocytokines,&#xD;
      induce a cytokine storm and augment neutrophil recruitment. Finally the aggregation of the&#xD;
      inactivated pulmonary surfactant by the protein rich edema con-joined with the degenerated&#xD;
      type 1 alveolar epithelial cells and the hyaline membrane covered, de-nuded alveolar basement&#xD;
      membrane disrupt the gas exchange capacity of the alveolo-capilar membrane, impairing blood&#xD;
      oxygenation and decarboxylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to bacterial-induced ARDS, viral agents causing ARDS mainly reach the alveolar&#xD;
      epithelium through viral transport from the nasopharynx, from the upper to the lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract. In viral infections, the damage to the lung is primarily caused by a&#xD;
      direct viral invasion of type 1 and 2 pneumocytes. This causes the accumulation of&#xD;
      protein-rich edema in a two-fold fashion by disabling the ENaC channels, mainly responsible&#xD;
      for the decongestion of the alveolar room through osmotic gradient creation, and by breaching&#xD;
      the physio-chemical barrier established by the pneumocytes. Albeit the effect of alveolar&#xD;
      barrier disruption by means of vascular endothelial dysfunction being reduced in contrast to&#xD;
      bacterial sepsis, with the ARDS advancing, both the endothelium and epithelium secrete&#xD;
      chemotactors to attract macrophages and neutrophils to the inflamed lung, which in analogy to&#xD;
      bacterial ARDS induce a secondary damage to the lung as already described. However point to&#xD;
      an exaggerated initial capillary leak as compared to other forms of ARDS, which strongly&#xD;
      suggests endothelial dysfunction as a primary mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial cell damage may be assessed using both glycocalyx degradation products such as&#xD;
      syndecan-1, heparan sulfate, and VE-cadherins and direct visualization of red blood cell flow&#xD;
      properties within the capillaries via handheld vital microscopy (HVM) employing the dark&#xD;
      field microscopy technique. Recent advances in the investiagtors group have enabled the&#xD;
      accurate differentiation of modes of microcirculatory failure by quantification of the&#xD;
      microcirculatory diffusion and convection capacity. From a global perspective, the alveolar&#xD;
      leakage has previously been quantified using transpulmonary thermodilution. These tools&#xD;
      provide the optimal prerequisites to specifically detect (glycocalyx degradation products in&#xD;
      the alveolar lavage fluid) and quantify (transpulmonary thermodilution) endothelial cell&#xD;
      damage in the lung during ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, approximately 20% of&#xD;
      critically ill patients suffering from ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described&#xD;
      in preliminary reports to develop severe systemic inflammatory response and circulatory&#xD;
      shock. In these patients, the relation between alveolar endothelial cell damage and systemic&#xD;
      endothelial cell damage is of central interest and may be assessed by concomitant sublingual&#xD;
      HVM measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the viral and inflammatory mediated lung damage as the initial trigger for ARDS,&#xD;
      the further deterioration of the lung function may mainly depend upon superinfection.&#xD;
      Bacterial and fungal superinfection has been described as mainly responsible for morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in mid- to late-phase viral ARDS during similar pandemics, such as the Spanish&#xD;
      Flu in 1918. In the current outbreak in China, presence of bacterial and fungal&#xD;
      superinfections was found in 10 to 30%. Superinfection seemed to represent a major risk&#xD;
      factor for mortality in the COVID-19 patients. Albeit being unclear if detection of bacterial&#xD;
      and fungal superinfection has a clinical and therapeutic relevance, several authors advocate&#xD;
      empirical antibiotic treatment targeting mainly S. aureus and S. pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only is the stratification of risk associated with bacterial and fungal superinfections&#xD;
      relevant to the assessment of severity of disease progression, but the question remains to be&#xD;
      assessed to which degree the presence of nosocomial pathogen transmission during pandemics&#xD;
      exists and is responsible for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Infection&#xD;
      prevention measures, such as standard and isolation precautions, are intended to prevent the&#xD;
      nosocomial transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. These measures include hand&#xD;
      hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g. isolation gowns, gloves, masks,&#xD;
      respirators, eye protection), and environmental measures - such as the cleaning and&#xD;
      disinfecting of surfaces and medical equipment and instruments. Yet, mobile devices, such as&#xD;
      private and professional mo-bile phones, have largely been unaddressed by such guidelines.&#xD;
      These devices may play an important role in indirect contact transmission. That is, when a&#xD;
      contaminated intermediate object is involved in the transfer of an infectious pathogen&#xD;
      between two individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence, although limited, has shown an increased viability of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic&#xD;
      and stainless steel, materials frequently employed on mobile devices and protective covers,&#xD;
      of up to 72 hours. Albeit incorrect hand hygiene, lack of personal protective equipment and&#xD;
      other hygienic routine mistakes are the most obvious vectors of nosocomial pathogens, mobile&#xD;
      phones and other handheld devices have been found to be insufficiently disinfected, allowing&#xD;
      pathogen colonization, of which S. aureus is the most frequent. This is aggravated by the&#xD;
      fact that healthcare providers touched mobile objects, including mobile phones, on average&#xD;
      once every 6.9 seconds and touched their own body or face every 40 seconds. This was&#xD;
      accompanied by an extremely low adherence to hand hygiene protocols prior to colonization and&#xD;
      infection events. These findings underline the potential of mobile devices, to act as vectors&#xD;
      of transmission of pathogens to both patients and healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In combating viral infections, the innate immune defense recognizes viral infection mainly&#xD;
      through binding of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to pathogen-recognition&#xD;
      receptors (PRRs). The expression cascade induced by these receptor bindings stimulates the&#xD;
      Interferon (IFN) Type I and III pathway. The recruitment of the inflammatory&#xD;
      monocyte-macrophage-neutrophil axis by the IFN I pathway is essential in the fight against&#xD;
      most viral infections. Neverthe-less, viruses such as the Influenza A virus are capable of&#xD;
      evading the IFN type I and III inception, by moving their replication machinery into the cell&#xD;
      nucleus thus evading the cytoplasmically located PRRs or inactivating interferon mRNAs&#xD;
      through proteins. The IFN I pathway can act two-fold in these viruses; on one side it may&#xD;
      mediate initial action against the virus reducing maximal reached titers, on the other hand,&#xD;
      under certain circumstances it can nevertheless pathologically overex-press inducing a&#xD;
      cytokine storm and increasing damage to the lung parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are positive-strand RNA viruses, which penetrate the cellular wall of&#xD;
      the infected cells by ACE-2 receptor mediated endocytosis. A onset of the IFN I pathway&#xD;
      expression may be associated with a stronger IFN II pathway activation and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine storm induction and consequently a more severe dysregulation of the inflammatory&#xD;
      monocyte-macrophage system and the degree of lung immunopathological damage. The&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanics of this new SARS-CoV-2 induced ARDS and the systemic&#xD;
      dysregulations it induces can only be speculated based on its predecessor SARS-CoV, and&#xD;
      insights elucidating the unusual clinical presentation of the novel disease are desperately&#xD;
      needed to derive an optimal treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the mechanisms of disease severity in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 ARDS are&#xD;
      manifold, ranging from a dysregulated inflammatory response, over the presence of bacterial&#xD;
      and fungal superinfections to the importance of nosocomial transmission as a key targetable&#xD;
      element in day-to-day patient care. Only a global assessment of all facets possibly&#xD;
      responsible for the severity of dis-ease progression in COVID-19 patients, can aim to&#xD;
      elucidate the underlying concoction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives The overarching aim of this research is to gain the pathophysiological&#xD;
      understanding to improve morbidity and mortality in ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This&#xD;
      research thus focuses on inflammation, microcirculatory dysfunction and superinfection,&#xD;
      aiming to elucidate risk factors for the development of severe ARDS of SARS-CoV-2 infected&#xD;
      patients and contribute to the rationale for therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual working hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary damage to the lung in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS is thought to be mediated by an&#xD;
           exaggerated pro-inflammatory response causing primary endothelial dysfunction, and&#xD;
           subsequently acting two-fold on the degradation of the lung parenchyma, through the&#xD;
           primary cytokine response, and through recruitment of the&#xD;
           inflammatory-monocyte-lymphocyte-neutrophil axis. The pronounced inflammation and&#xD;
           primary damage to the lung disrupt the pulmonary microbiome, leading secondarily to&#xD;
           pulmonary superinfections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulmonary bacterial superinfections (i.e., S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and&#xD;
           others) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
           Pathogen colonization in the upper airways is a prerequisite and the main risk factor&#xD;
           for lower respiratory tract infections. To establish colonization, pathogens have to&#xD;
           interact with the local microbiota (a.k.a. microbiome) and certain microbiome profiles&#xD;
           will be more resistant to pathogen invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Handheld devices used in clinical routine are a carrier of both, SARS-CoV-2, as well as&#xD;
           bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia, making them a potential reservoir for indirect&#xD;
           contact transmission. A targeted infection prevention intervention can reduce this&#xD;
           contamination and thereby reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission.&#xD;
