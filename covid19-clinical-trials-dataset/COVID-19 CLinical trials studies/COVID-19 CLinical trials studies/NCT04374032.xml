  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The justification for the use of immunomodulatory therapy is based on the evidence that drugs&#xD;
      that are inhibitors of interleukin IL6 may prevent the more severe lung tissue damage caused&#xD;
      by cytokine release in patients with more severe COVID19. Several studies have suggested a&#xD;
      &quot;cytokine storm&quot; caused by the release of IL-6, IL-1, IL-12 and IL-18 with tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor TNF alpha and other inflammatory mediators. Increased inflammatory response of lung&#xD;
      tissue may result in increased gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary level making&#xD;
      oxygenation difficult in patients with more severe forms of the disease and the need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. In this regard, it is hypothesized that the use of immunomodulatory&#xD;
      therapy should have an effect in reducing the lethal outcome, the need for oxygen therapy,&#xD;
      and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
