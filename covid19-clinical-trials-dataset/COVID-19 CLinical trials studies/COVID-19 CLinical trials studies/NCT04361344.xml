  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence of Covid-19 virus is associated with high frequency of extremely severe clinical&#xD;
      pictures, with minor signs of CNS impairment (e.g. anosmia, headache). Since neurotropism is&#xD;
      a common feature of coronavirus infection in animals, the investigators examine if indirect&#xD;
      signs of CNS lesion are observed in association with severe Covid-19 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In animals, coronavirus infection is commonly associated with CNS involvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      epilepsy and ataxia are observed during Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) and virus is&#xD;
      recovered in CSF, CNS is involved with strain-dependent severity in mice and rats infected by&#xD;
      murine hepatitis virus, and murine infection with MHV A59 strain is a model of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). Mice encephalitis occurs through infection of olfactory bulb and spreads&#xD;
      along the axonal pathway. Viral antigens and neuronal apoptosis are observed in brainstem and&#xD;
      hypothalamus, without minimal or absent inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most COVID-19 patients with neurologic impairment displayed expected complications of severe&#xD;
      infections (e.g. neuropathy and muscle loss, stroke) but encephalitis remained exceptional,&#xD;
      as previously observed in SRAS. It is argued that central lesions may explain some of the&#xD;
      clinical features ventilation failure, or disproportionate residual fatigue and cognition&#xD;
      impairment in survivors of severe COVID infection. According to data obtained from various&#xD;
      coronavirus infections in animals, the investigators ask if severe COVID infection in human&#xD;
      could be associated with sub-clinical encephalitis. This clinical trial examines highly&#xD;
      sensitive blood biomarkers of brain dysfunction in correlation with late clinical outcome.&#xD;
      Biomarkers are neurofilament light chain (NFL) and GFAP. Clinical outcomes are death, signs&#xD;
      of central neurologic sequellae, and fatigue. Clinical examination and blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained at inclusion (d0), which is mostly the entrance in intensive care unit (ICU), at day&#xD;
      7 (between day 4 and exit from ICU) and at day 60.&#xD;
