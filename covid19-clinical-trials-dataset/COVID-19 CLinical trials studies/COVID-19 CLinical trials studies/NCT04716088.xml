      Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of&#xD;
      Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study.&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested&#xD;
      with a point-of-care rapid antigen test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (RT-PCR). In addition, serum samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks&#xD;
      after last swab was obtained in order to evaluate the serological status of participating&#xD;
      health care workers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Health care workers (HCW) currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and&#xD;
      Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to enroll in the pilot study. HCW directly involved in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patient care and those who had a previous laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      were not eligible for inclusion in the study. For each participating HCW, nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs were obtained. Swabs were collected on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for two&#xD;
      consecutive weeks with a maximum of six samplings per person scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs were inserted into universal transport medium (UTM) and tested with SARS-CoV-2 Rapid&#xD;
      Antigen test (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), in accordance with the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, samples were thoroughly vortexed and 350 μL of UTM were&#xD;
      mixed with the extraction buffer included in the testing kit. Three drops of the mixture were&#xD;
      applied to the specimen well of the lateral flow test device and results were visually read&#xD;
      after a 15 min incubation at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swab samples were subsequently tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      without intermitting freeze-thaw cycle. Viral RNA was isolated from the specimens using the&#xD;
      QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). PCR amplification was set up on&#xD;
      CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories - Dubai Branch, Dubai,&#xD;
      United Arab Emirates) and a commercially available PCR kit Allplex™2019-nCoV (Seegene, Seoul,&#xD;
      South Korea) was used. Allplex™2019-nCoV assay enables simultaneous detection and&#xD;
      identification of three target genes, specific for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. the E, RdRp, and N gene).&#xD;
      Samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 only if all three targeted genes were&#xD;
      amplified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, serum samples were collected at the beginning of the study and 14 days after the&#xD;
      last nasopharyngeal swab was obtained. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were&#xD;
      evaluated using IDK anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISA Kit (Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim,&#xD;
      Germany), following manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
