  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China, in&#xD;
      December 2019, and has since spread worldwide. The disease is mild in 85% of cases but the&#xD;
      remaining 15% requires hospitalization and/or intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications show that a significant number of COVID-19 patients are co-infected with&#xD;
      one or more pathogens. Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19&#xD;
      disease and a considerable number of patients arrive to the Emergency rooms with&#xD;
      mild-moderate respiratory symptoms compatible with pneumonia of presumed bacterial origin and&#xD;
      not severe enough for requiring hospitalization. It therefore seems reasonable to adopt&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies for these patients that are effective and easy to follow in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cefditoren (CDN) is a third-generation cephalosporin for oral administration. CDN has a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of activity and is particularly active against the bacterial pathogens involved in&#xD;
      community respiratory tract infections. Besides that, the use of CDN has been associated with&#xD;
      a marked decrease in circulating levels of IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      mediators of epithelial damage. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that CDN improves&#xD;
      clinical condition in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 and symptoms of bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China, in&#xD;
      December 2019, and has since spread worldwide. The novel coronavirus is now referred to as&#xD;
      severe and critical acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is&#xD;
      mild in 85% of cases but the remaining 15% requires hospitalization and/or intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications show that a variable number of COVID-19 patients are co-infected with one&#xD;
      or more pathogens. Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      and in a retrospective study, secondary infection was observed in 50% of non-survivor&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COVID-19 patients the elevated inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      present suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may&#xD;
      play a major role in the pathology of this disease. The elevated cytokine levels,&#xD;
      specifically IL-6, may also be responsible for the lethal complications of COVID-19.&#xD;
      Therefore, the interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade has been proposed as one of the strategies to&#xD;
      manage COVID-19-induced CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A considerable number of COVID-19 patients arrive to the Emergency rooms with mild-moderate&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms compatible with pneumonia of presumed bacterial origin not severe enough&#xD;
      for requiring hospitalization. It therefore seems reasonable to adopt therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      for these patients that are effective and easy to follow in the outpatient setting to avoid&#xD;
      overloading the Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cefditoren (CDN) is a third-generation cephalosporin for oral administration. CDN has a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of activity and is particularly active against the bacterial pathogens involved in&#xD;
      community respiratory tract infections. The results of clinical trials with CDN on&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia showed percentages of clinical and microbiological efficacy&#xD;
      around 85%. On the other hand, the use of CDN has been associated with a marked decrease in&#xD;
      circulating levels of IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of epithelial&#xD;
      damage such as Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above and the current estate of knowledge against SARS-CoV-2, we have&#xD;
      considered of relevance to study the efficacy of CDN in a series of patients with&#xD;
      mild-moderate COVID-19 and with symptoms compatible with pneumonia of presumed bacterial&#xD;
      origin, seen at the Emergency room of a public hospital and followed on outpatient basis.&#xD;
