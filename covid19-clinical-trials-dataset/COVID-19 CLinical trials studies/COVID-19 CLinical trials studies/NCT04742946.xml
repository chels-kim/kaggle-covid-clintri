  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 can cause important sequels in the respiratory system by bilateral pneumonia and&#xD;
      frequently presents loss of strength, dyspnea, polyneuropathies and multi-organic&#xD;
      affectation. Physiotherapy interventions acquires a fundamental role in the recovery of the&#xD;
      functions and the quality of life. Regarding the recovery phases after hospital discharge,&#xD;
      both in patients with mild-moderate and severe-critical conditions, the currently evidence&#xD;
      available are very preliminary. Telerehabilitation is presented as a promising complementary&#xD;
      treatment method to standard physiotherapy. The main objective of this research is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized telerehabilitation intervention in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Covid-19 after discharge from hospital for the improvement of functional&#xD;
      capacity and quality of life compared to a program of health education and/or care in a&#xD;
      rehabilitation center, which is the current standard procedure in the Health Service of the&#xD;
      Junta de Andalucía (Spain). As secondary objectives, the aim is to identify the satisfaction&#xD;
      and perception of patients with the telerehabilitation intervention and the presence of&#xD;
      barriers to its implementation, as well as to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the&#xD;
      perspective of the health system. This research will be carried out through a single blind&#xD;
      multicenter randomized clinical trial in patients residing in Andalucía (Spain). The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this research is that the implementation of a Telerehabilitation program&#xD;
      presents results not inferior than those obtained with the current standard intervention. If&#xD;
      hypothesis is confirmed, that would be an opportunity to define new policies and&#xD;
      interventions to address this disease and its consequences.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Live The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions (i.e. an EQ-5D health state or profile) can be converted into a single number called an index value. The index value reflects how good or bad the health state is according to the preferences of the general population of a country/region. The collection of index values for all possible EQ-5D states is called a value set. Value sets are currently available for the EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L for different countries/regions. Several valuation techniques have been used to generate these value sets: time trade-off (TTO), visual analogue scale (VAS), and more recently, discrete choice experiments (DCE).</description>
