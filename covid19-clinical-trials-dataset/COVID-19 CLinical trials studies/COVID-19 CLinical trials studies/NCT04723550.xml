  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, in order to cope with the global pandemic of the COVID-19 virus, governments have&#xD;
      introduced corresponding measures, COVID-19 lockdown is one of the most important measures.&#xD;
      However, lockdown makes the management of chronic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes) more&#xD;
      difficult, and telemedicine may be one of the solutions. We hope to explore the effect of&#xD;
      telemedicine on blood glucose control and other prognostic indicators of young and&#xD;
      middle-aged obese patients with type 2 diabetes who will experience isolation control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We recruit patients with type 2 diabetes who need to be isolated due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      epidemic, Our study will include young and middle-aged obese patients. The lockdown period is&#xD;
      21 days. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups with a total follow-up time of&#xD;
      6 months. One group is the telemedicine intervention group, and the other group is the&#xD;
      routine follow-up control group. The intervention group used the hospital telemedicine&#xD;
      management system to upload blood glucose values (fasting and 2h after three meals), food&#xD;
      intake of three meals, and exercise volume (Data collection frequency: first three months, 4&#xD;
      times/week; 4-6 Month, 2 times/week).Doctors will collect data from hospital telemedicine&#xD;
      management system to guide patients on diets, exercise, and medication adjustments. The&#xD;
      control group will be followed up by telephone/outpatient clinic every 1 week. (only&#xD;
      telephone follow-up will be conducted during the lockdown period) Then doctors will collect&#xD;
      their blood glucose values.(fasting and 2h after three meals) Based on the data collected,&#xD;
      The doctors will provide lifestyle guidance to the patients on the telephone or face to face.&#xD;
      The clinical data of the two groups of patients will be collected at baseline, 22 days, 3&#xD;
      months, and 6 months respectively. (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose(FBG), blood glucose 2 hours&#xD;
      after breakfast, blood pressure, Body Mass Index(BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, total&#xD;
      cholesterol(TC), triglyceride(TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), Blood Urea Nitrogen(BUN), serum creatinine(Scr), e-GFR,&#xD;
      Self-rating Depression Scale, frequency of hypoglycemia，and Cost effectiveness) The clinical&#xD;
      data will be statistically analyzed.&#xD;
