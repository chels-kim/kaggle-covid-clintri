      The overarching objective of the proposed project is to test the relative clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of CBD isolate, full-spectrum CBD oil, and placebo in in reducing COVID-Induced stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, anger, and sleep disturbance.&#xD;

      Background and Significance of the Proposed Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has hit us like a ton of bricks creating unimaginable levels of&#xD;
      unanticipated death, financial hardship, and dramatic changes in nearly every facet of our&#xD;
      life including school, work, shopping, social and family life. Sadly, the physical, mental,&#xD;
      economic, and health burden of COVID-19 disproportionately affects the poor, the elderly, and&#xD;
      people of color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stress-induced by these changes as well as the lack of control we have over them,&#xD;
      increases risk for new onset of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, substance&#xD;
      abuse, sleep disturbance, and family violence as well as exacerbation of symptoms among those&#xD;
      with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Although many people will successfully manage the&#xD;
      increased stress from COVID-19 on their own or with the support from family and friends,&#xD;
      others may need extra help to cope. Consequently, there is an urgent need for developing&#xD;
      cost-effective strategies for managing the stress-induced psychological consequences of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There's been considerable excitement in the press over the potential therapeutic use of&#xD;
      cannabidiol (CBD) products in the treatment of a variety of physical and mental health&#xD;
      problems. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) is still illegal in most states because&#xD;
      of its psychoactive abuse potential. In contrast, cannabidiol (CBD) does not convert to THC&#xD;
      in the body and has negligible side effects relative to main-stream psychiatric drugs&#xD;
      (benzodiazepines and antidepressants) commonly prescribed for the treatment of stress-related&#xD;
      disorders such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Mounting evidence from studies with&#xD;
      rodents suggests that CBD may confer significant promising health-related benefits including&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, anti-cancer, memory enhancement, and facilitation of fear&#xD;
      extinction (see White for a recent review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest success story for CBD use in humans to date comes from placebo-controlled&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials demonstrating a 50% or more reduction in previously intractable&#xD;
      seizures in children suffering from Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Moreover,&#xD;
      several controlled clinical trials have shown promising findings in reducing psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms among patients with schizophrenia and among young adults displaying THC-induced&#xD;
      psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Evidence that CBD may offer promise in the treatment of stress-related disorders&#xD;
      has started to emerge. A small pilot trial with 24 patients presenting with social anxiety&#xD;
      disorder found that relative to placebo, a single dose of 100 mg of CBD oil led to lower&#xD;
      levels of anxiety, cognitive impairment, and discomfort in their actual speech performance as&#xD;
      well as their anxiety before the speech. An uncontrolled case series of 11 PTSD patients&#xD;
      receiving 8 weeks of CBD, reported a 28% reduction in PTSD symptom scores. In a small 4-week&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of 37 young Japanese adults with social anxiety disorder, Masataka&#xD;
      found a significant advantage of CBD over placebo in reducing subjects' scores on two widely&#xD;
      used measures of social anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why Compare CBD-Isolate with Full-Spectrum CBD? CBD isolate is the purest form of CBD. It is&#xD;
      made by extracting it from its natural environment - either hemp which is legal and&#xD;
      recognized as generally safe in all states because of its low THC content (less than .3%), or&#xD;
      the marijuana plant which has high levels of THC (up to 30%) and remains a Schedule 1&#xD;
      controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike hemp-derived CBD Isolate, hemp-derived full-spectrum CBD contains all the hundreds of&#xD;
      phytochemicals naturally found in the cannabis plant, including CBD, trace cannabinoids&#xD;
      including Cannabinol (CBN), Cannabichromene (CBC), Cannabigerol (CBDA) and Cannabidivarin&#xD;
      (CBDV), and more than 200 different terpenes, essential oils, and negligible THC content&#xD;
      (less than 0.3%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research demonstrating the wide-ranging therapeutic effects of CBD oil including anti-emetic,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and anti-psychotic effects were based on studies using pure&#xD;
      doses of CBD Isolate. However, more recently it has been shown that the therapeutic effects&#xD;
      of purified CBD display a bell-shaped dose-response curve suggesting a limited dose range,&#xD;
      with no beneficial effects achieved at either lower or higher doses. This narrow therapeutic&#xD;
      window presents a challenge for using CBD isolate clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on recent research with rodents and humans, administration of a full spectrum cannabis&#xD;
      extract containing mostly CBD but also containing other minor phytocannabinoids and&#xD;
      non-cannabinoids exerted a synergistic effect with CBD that was both more effective than CBD&#xD;
      Isolate without the unwanted bell-shaped dose-response curve. This finding has been named the&#xD;
      entourage effect. However, to date, there are no human trials for any physical or mental&#xD;
      health problem comparing the gold standard CBD isolate with a full-spectrum CBD formulation,&#xD;
      despite the fact that both forms of CBD are widely available without a prescription in stores&#xD;
      all across the United States. The proposed project will provide important data to determine&#xD;
      whether a full-spectrum CBD formulation offers any advantages over CBD isolate in reducing&#xD;
      COVID-19 stress-induced symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the efficacy of a 4-week daily regimen of hemp-derived CBD isolate (300 mg/day),&#xD;
           full spectrum CBD oil (300 mg/day), or placebo oil in reducing patient-rated symptoms of&#xD;
           stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. It is predicted that patients&#xD;
           receiving either CBD oil from pure isolate or full spectrum CBD oil will show&#xD;
           significantly greater reduction in emotional distress and sleep disturbance relative to&#xD;
           those receiving placebo oil. It is also predicted that full-spectrum CBD oil will&#xD;
           outperform CBD isolate in reducing COVID-19 stress-induced symptoms of stress, anxiety,&#xD;
           depression, anger, and sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine predictors of patients' clinical response to the 3 treatments. It is expected&#xD;
           that the superiority of full-spectrum CBD oil relative to CBD isolate or placebo will be&#xD;
           more pronounced for patients showing more severe COVID-19 stress-induced symptoms at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the perceived acceptability and side effects profile of 4 weeks of daily&#xD;
           CBD/Placebo oil ingestion. It is expected that both CBD products (CBD isolate or Full&#xD;
           spectrum CBD) will show minimal side effects that will not exceed the level of side&#xD;
           effects for those ingesting placebo oil with the possible exception of somnolence.&#xD;
