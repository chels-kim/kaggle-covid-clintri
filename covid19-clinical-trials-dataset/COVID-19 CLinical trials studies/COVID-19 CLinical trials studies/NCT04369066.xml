  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research proposes to study a large healthy population active for the presence of&#xD;
      antibodies directed against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      virus and this over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verification of the inclusion criteria and information by the coordinating&#xD;
      investigative doctor, the volunteers sign a written consent. A nurse will take blood samples&#xD;
      under safe conditions compatible with the pandemic period and while respecting the protection&#xD;
      of the volunteer's personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be taken at 4 times for Institute Curie and Institute Pasteur: T0 (day&#xD;
      of inclusion), between 6 weeks and 3 months ,6 months and 12 months post-inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each blood sample consists of a collection of 5 mL of blood in a dry tube. The serum samples&#xD;
      will be extracted and collected prospectively from the blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasopharyngeal swabs will be performed at 3 times: , between 6 weeks and 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months post-inclusion for Institute Curie staff who have had at least one of&#xD;
      the following four criteria on the sample or questionnaire carried out at T0:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have had RT-PCR+&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and/or presence of antibodies at the 95% threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and/or anosmia/ageusia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and/or digestive syndrome with associated respiratory signs. In case of infection&#xD;
           between sampling times, if the volunteer meets one of the four criteria above, a&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal swab will be performed during the following visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasopharyngeal swab shall also be proposed to volunteers not meeting the 4 above listed&#xD;
      criteria in order to have a control group (about 100 volunteers) for future statistical&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the volunteers accept, naso-pharyngeal swab shall be performed between 6 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months and 12 months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For volunteers already included at Institute Curie : in case of proved (RT-PCR+ or antigenic&#xD;
      +) or very likely (anosmia and/or ageusia, and/or digestive syndrome with associated&#xD;
      respiratory signs) between 2 sampling times already planned in the flow chart, blood samples&#xD;
      and nasopharyngeal swabs shall be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those shall be performed if time since last planned sampling(s) has been more than 3 weeks or&#xD;
      if time until next sampling(s) is more than 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samplings and nasopharyngeal swabs will be performed at 4 times for Institute&#xD;
      Pasteur personnel: at T0 (inclusion day), between 6 weeks and 3 months, at 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months post-inclusion&#xD;
