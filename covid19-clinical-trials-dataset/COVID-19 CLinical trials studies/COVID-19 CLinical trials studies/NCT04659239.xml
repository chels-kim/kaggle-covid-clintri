    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled phase III clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine, Inactivated (Vero Cell) in&#xD;
      adults aged 18 years and above after 2-dose schedule.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial includes two parts, namely the efficacy study and immunogenicity bridging study. A&#xD;
      total of 34020 participants will be enrolled, i.e. 32820 for efficacy cohort, and 1200 for&#xD;
      domestic immunogenicity cohort in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy study: Participants will be randomly inoculated with two doses of investigational&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo according to 1:1 ratio following Day 0-Day 14 immunization schedule and&#xD;
      will be observed from the first dose of investigational vaccine to collect symptomatic and&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases for the evaluation of the efficacy of the investigational&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity bridging study: Before inoculating the first dose, 14 days, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months after the whole-course immunization, blood samples will be taken for determination of&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 (ELISA method); and before&#xD;
      inoculating the first dose, 6 months and 12 months after the whole-course immunization, blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken for detecting specific T cells with the ELISPOT assay with an aim to&#xD;
      evaluate immunogenicity and immune persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety observations for all participants will be conducted from the first dose to 28 days&#xD;
      after the whole-course immunization, and follow-up of SAEs will also be conducted from the&#xD;
      first dose to at least 12 months after the whole-course immunization to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of the investigational vaccine.&#xD;
