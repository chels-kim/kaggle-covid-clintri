  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quarantine separates persons who have been potentially exposed to an infectious agent (and&#xD;
      thus at risk for disease) from the general community. However, it may create psychological,&#xD;
      emotional, and financial problems for some persons. The experience of those placed under&#xD;
      quarantine in terms of compliance, difficulties, emotional response and psychological impact&#xD;
      remains under-researched. In view of the increasing cases of COVID-19 in India and the rising&#xD;
      numbers of people being quarantined as a precautionary measure, it was imperative to assess&#xD;
      those quarantined for the psychological impact of the concerns regarding this illness and the&#xD;
      quarantine procedure. In India, no such study had been undertaken and our study thus filled&#xD;
      the research gap. The cross-sectional observational study aims at assessing the psychological&#xD;
      impact of quarantine on Indian BSF jawans (n=100). They would be assessed for depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, perceived stress level of impact, and impact of life events using Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, and Impact of Events&#xD;
      Scale-Revised. A qualitative interview schedule will also be carried out. Data would be&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
