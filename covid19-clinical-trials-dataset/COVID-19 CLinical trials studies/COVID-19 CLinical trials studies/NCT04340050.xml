  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      convalescent plasma to hospitalized patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus&#xD;
      disease (COVID-19), the infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2). Human convalescent plasma is an option for treatment of COVID-19 and could be&#xD;
      rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can&#xD;
      donate high titer neutralizing immunoglobulin-containing plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Collecting and administering convalescent plasma requires a level of logistical&#xD;
      coordination that is not available in all centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish feasibility for a hospital-based integrated system to collect and&#xD;
      administer convalescent plasma to patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19.&#xD;
