      The consequences of COVID-19 in these already fragile patients should be evaluated. It will&#xD;
      be important to appreciate the confinement consequences imposed on the patient on the course&#xD;
      and impact of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These consequences can be assessed by the end of confinement and 6 months after the latter is&#xD;
      lifted.&#xD;

      Adaptation capacities are necessary to cope with the brutal and drastic changes imposed by&#xD;
      the pandemic and its consequences. In Parkinson's disease, where there are routine situations&#xD;
      with difficulties adjusting to newness, patients in the current situation may be particularly&#xD;
      affected and present anxiety due to great difficulties in adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repercussions in terms of symptoms (motor and non-motor) of the disease could be very&#xD;
      significant. In this population already widely exposed to anxio-depressive symptoms&#xD;
      (depression being a common symptom of Parkinson's disease, affecting up to 30 to 40% of&#xD;
      patients outside of crisis periods), we can expect a risk increased psychiatric&#xD;
      decompensation. The psychiatric consequences could not be limited to the current period but&#xD;
      also concern long-term patients, in particular if there is decompensation of other symptoms&#xD;
      of the disease (motors, complications linked to treatment, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of COVID-19 in these already fragile patients should be evaluated. It will&#xD;
      be important to appreciate the confinement consequences imposed on the patient on the course&#xD;
      and impact of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These consequences can be assessed by the end of confinement and 6 months after the latter is&#xD;
      lifted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, French multicenter study, of an uncontrolled cohort of parkinsonian&#xD;
      patients followed by doctors from Parkinson Expert Centers in hospitals.&#xD;
