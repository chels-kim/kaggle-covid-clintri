    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ZnAg liquid solution in symptomatic participants with acute COVID-19&#xD;
      (PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 infection) that are not hospitalized at the time of enrollment&#xD;
      (e.g., present to an emergency room without being admitted to the hospital or diagnosed in an&#xD;
      outpatient clinic setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have presented with two or more symptoms of acute COVID-19 (within 96 hours&#xD;
      prior to the Baseline visit) self-reported as moderate or severe at the Baseline visit,&#xD;
      including fever, myalgia, fatigue, chest tightness, chills, cough, diarrhea, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      distress, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, ageusia, anosmia, nausea, tingling&#xD;
      or numbness in the extremities, or shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 infection must be&#xD;
      confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing within 96 hours prior to the Baseline&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who&#xD;
      formally consent to participate will be randomized 1:1:2 to receive ZnAg (low dose) : ZnAg&#xD;
      (high dose) placebo in a double-blind fashion in addition to standard supportive care. Within&#xD;
      the active treatment arm, participants will be randomized to receive either low or high dose&#xD;
      ZnAg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active treatment with 60 ml low-dose ZnAg (Zn 6 ug/ml and Ag 10 ug/ml; equivalent to 0.6&#xD;
           mg Ag, 0.36 mg Zn), po q12 hours or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active treatment with 60 ml high-dose ZnAg (Zn 12 ug/ml and Ag 20 ug/ml; equivalent to&#xD;
           1.2 mg Ag, 0.72 mg Zn), po q12 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 ml matching placebo, po q12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who become clinically unstable during the course of the study (e.g., requiring&#xD;
      high-flow supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilatory support) per the judgement of the&#xD;
      site investigator will be admitted to a hospital and their clinical status (e.g., vital&#xD;
      status, hospitalization status, respiratory status, COVID-19 ordinal scale) will continue to&#xD;
      be tracked per protocol.&#xD;
