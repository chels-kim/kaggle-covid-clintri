  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study includes patients over 18 years old who were hospitalized in our covid intensive&#xD;
      care unit between March 16 and May 16, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective records were examined by examining the electronic data files of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests performed with nasopharyngeal swab taken from the&#xD;
      person, which is the standard diagnostic method, and also the diagnosis of infection&#xD;
      symptoms, risk factors and thoracic CT scans indicating pneumonia were diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years of age with and without a medical history of DM in their history were&#xD;
      identified and compared in 2 groups.&#xD;
