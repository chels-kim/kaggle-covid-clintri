  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to identify PVP-I at 1.25% as an appropriate intranasal&#xD;
      topical preparation for patients undergoing rhinoplasty with no effect on the nasal mucosa&#xD;
      cilia (NMC) or olfaction using the saccharin transit time (STT) test as a method for&#xD;
      evaluating NMC function. PVP-I has been shown to be viricidal in the upper aerodigestive&#xD;
      tract. This study is highly-relevant, as protection for individuals with a high risk of&#xD;
      exposure to respiratory pathogens has become increasingly important in the setting of recent&#xD;
      viral epidemics such as SARS-CoV-2. Septorhinoplasty is commonly performed throughout the&#xD;
      world and there is a paucity of standardized testing in surgical facilities. Much of our&#xD;
      understanding of the current COVID-19 pandemic is extrapolated from MERS and SARS data. It is&#xD;
      our hope that this study's relevance for the current pandemic remains so in the unfortunate&#xD;
      event of another pandemic in the future.&#xD;

    <description>NMC will be assessed with the saccharin transit time (STT) test. This test is done by the examiner inserting sodium saccharin particle on the upper surface of the inferior nasal turbinate.The patient is instructed to swallow once every minute and notify the examiner when they notice a sweet taste. The distance from the start of the mucociliary membrane to far wall of pharynx is measured with a probe. From this measurement, the mean velocity is calculated compared to the total time from the start of the test. Dysfunction is defined as a STT &gt;30.</description>

    <measure>Change in self reported symptoms of nasal blockage or obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal symptoms will be assessed with the NOSE (Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation) Tool. NOSE has 5 questions and response options for each range from 0 to 4 where 0= Not a problem, 1= Mild problem, 2= Moderate problem, 3= Significant problem, 4= Severe problem. The response value for each question is multiplied by 5 so overall NOSE scores can range from 0 to 100 and are interpreted as-- 0: Nothing to worry about; 5 - 25: Mild obstruction; 26 - 50: Moderate obstruction; 51 - 75: Significant obstruction; 76 - 100: Severe obstruction.</description>

    <measure>Change in olfactory function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be instructed to sniff repetitively and to tell when an odor is detected, identifying the odor if recognized. The test odor up to within 30 cm or less of the nose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life based on sino-nasal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' quality of life will be assessed using the Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). This is a self administered questionnaire with 22 items. Each items is answered by selecting one of 6 categories where 0 = No problem, 1 = Very Mild problem, 2 = Mild or slight problem, 3 = Moderate problem, 4 = Severe problem, 5 = Problem as bad as it can be. Scores can range from 0 to 110. A score of 7 or below is considered 'normal' scores 8 or above suggests that sino-nasal symptoms are affecting participants' quality of life.</description>
