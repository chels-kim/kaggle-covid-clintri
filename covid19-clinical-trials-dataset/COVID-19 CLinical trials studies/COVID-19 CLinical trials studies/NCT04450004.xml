  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost, staggered dose-escalation&#xD;
      Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      Coronavirus-Like Particle COVID-19 Vaccine at three dose levels (3.75 µg, 7.5 µg, and 15 µg&#xD;
      VLP) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in healthy adults 18 to 55 years&#xD;
      of age, who have been tested for the absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each dose level, the vaccine will initially be administered to a small number of subjects.&#xD;
      Vaccinations of the first 6 subjects at the lowest dose level will be staggered so that each&#xD;
      vaccination must be performed at least 30 minutes apart. Vaccination of the remaining&#xD;
      subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level will be administered&#xD;
      with approval of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same process will be&#xD;
      followed for the second vaccine administration. All subjects will be followed for a period of&#xD;
      12 months after the second administration of the vaccine for safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      testing at the end of the follow-up period.&#xD;
