  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effects of a medicine called baricitinib on the&#xD;
      progression of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019), the medical condition caused by the&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Baricitinib is FDA-approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition. This study intends to define&#xD;
      the impact of baricitinib on the severity and progression of COVID-19. This drug might to&#xD;
      lower the hyperinflammation caused by the virus, which would prevent damage to the lungs and&#xD;
      possibly other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to recruit 80 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trial, with a focus on the assessment of safety in the&#xD;
      first 20 participants (Phase 2), followed by a much broader assessment of efficacy, while&#xD;
      continuing to monitor safety, in an additional 60 participants (Phase 3, total participants&#xD;
      across Phase 2/3 n=80). Both phases are single arm, open label, and occur at a single site at&#xD;
      the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH). Data from participants in this study will be&#xD;
      compared with data from other COVID-19 patients not receiving baricitinib. Study participants&#xD;
      will receive 2 mg/day of baricitinib for 14 days and will be followed for up to 29 days.&#xD;

    <description>This study is an Adaptive Phase 2/3 trial designed to test the safety (Phase 2) and efficacy (Phase 2 and 3) of baricitinib to treat COVID-19. Phase 2 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 20 participants receiving 2 mg baricitinib once daily for 14 days. Phase 3 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 60 additional participants receiving baricitinib at the same dose. In both phases, participants will be monitored daily while hospitalized for 29 days, or until discharge, whichever occurs first. Participants who are discharged will be followed up with via phone on Day 15 and Day 29.</description>
