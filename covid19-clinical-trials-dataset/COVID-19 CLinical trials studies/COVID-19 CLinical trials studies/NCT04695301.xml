  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, an acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and in most&#xD;
      cases, causes mild to moderate symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnea. However, a not&#xD;
      insignificant portion, given the total number of people affected, will present symptoms of&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory failure and multiple organ failure, requiring hospitalization under&#xD;
      intensive care, use of mechanical ventilation, prolonged period of immobilization and,&#xD;
      consequently, physical, cognitive and psychological damage, which may affect survivors for a&#xD;
      long period after hospitalization. All of these factors are known to have an impact on&#xD;
      various areas of life: personal, social and economic, which makes the need for continued&#xD;
      specific care after hospital discharge relevant. In this context, the role of rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs is fundamental, aiming not only at a safer dehospitalization, but also at the&#xD;
      continuity of care with the objective of restoring the biopsychosocial skills of these&#xD;
      individuals, allowing functional independence for activities of daily life and a shorter&#xD;
      return physical and social activities performed before the disease. However, the big&#xD;
      challenge for the health system is how to offer this on a large scale. Therefore, knowing the&#xD;
      clinical and functional profile of these patients at discharge and verifying the viability of&#xD;
      a digital platform for rehabilitation and monitoring of these patients is the first step to&#xD;
      allow the creation of a new form of continuity of care and access to affected patients with&#xD;
      serious diseases such as COVID-19 and other syndromes capable of generate functional&#xD;
      impairment. Therefore,the investigators objective is to characterize and monitor the&#xD;
      functional profile and exercise capacity of patients affected by COVID-19 at the hospital&#xD;
      discharge, as well as to verify the viability and compliance of patients to the use of a&#xD;
      digital platform for the application of a distance rehabilitation program.&#xD;

      The investigators proposal is to characterize and evaluate the impact of the disease on the&#xD;
      clinical, functional and social aspects in these patients affected by COVID-19 and to propose&#xD;
      the continuity of specific care after hospital discharge with a physical rehabilitation&#xD;
      program through a digital platform, remotely for a period of 3 months. The proposed&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients convalescing from COVID-19 and undergoing the rehabilitation&#xD;
      program will have a gain in functional skills and quality of life. The professional team&#xD;
      involved in this study will be responsible for managing, monitoring and evaluating the&#xD;
      participating patients and monitoring the performance of the proposed functional exercises.&#xD;
