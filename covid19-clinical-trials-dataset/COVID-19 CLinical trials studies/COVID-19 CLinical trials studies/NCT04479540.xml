  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is&#xD;
      complicated by pneumonia (15 to 20% of cases) requiring hospitalization with oxygen therapy.&#xD;
      Almost 20 to 25% of hospitalized patients require intensive care and resuscitation; half die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of death is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, some deaths&#xD;
      have been linked to pulmonary embolism (PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of PE is important because there is specific treatment to limit its own&#xD;
      mortality. The identification of biological parameters of hemostasis predictive of&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease is crucial in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the frequency of PE in the patients having to be hospitalized is to practice of a&#xD;
      systematic thoracic angiography scanner in the patients having no contra-indication for its&#xD;
      realization, as well as during hospitalization in patients deteriorating without any other&#xD;
      obvious cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thromboembolic events and disturbances of the coagulation system described in patients&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis suggest that this viral infection is associated with an increase&#xD;
      in the activation of coagulation contributing to the occurrence of thrombosis and especially&#xD;
      from PE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is&#xD;
      complicated by pneumonia (15 to 20% of cases) requiring hospitalization with oxygen therapy.&#xD;
      Almost 20 to 25% of hospitalized patients require intensive care and resuscitation; half die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On April 3, 2020, in France, 59,105 confirmed cases have been identified. 6,305 people are&#xD;
      hospitalized in intensive care and 4,503 patients died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of death is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, some deaths&#xD;
      have been linked to pulmonary embolism (PE). Very little data is available in the medical&#xD;
      literature regarding PE during this infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of PE is important because there is specific treatment to limit its own&#xD;
      mortality. The identification of biological parameters of hemostasis predictive of&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease is crucial in these patients who are difficult to mobilize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic difficulties with traditional means, the seriousness and the ignorance of a PE&#xD;
      make it necessary to evaluate the frequency of it in the patients having to be hospitalized&#xD;
      by the practice of a systematic thoracic angiography scanner in the patients having no&#xD;
      contra-indication for its realization, as well as during hospitalization in patients&#xD;
      deteriorating without any other obvious cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thromboembolic events and disturbances of the coagulation system described in patients&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis suggest that this viral infection is associated with an increase&#xD;
      in the activation of coagulation contributing to the occurrence of thrombosis and especially&#xD;
      from PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this work is therefore to determine the incidence of the occurrence of&#xD;
      PE in patients with hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis by performing systematic thoracic&#xD;
      angiography scanner in all hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to study the coagulation and fibrinolysis profile in these&#xD;
      patients and to assess endothelial activation in order to better understand the&#xD;
      physio-pathological mechanism behind PE and to determine if one of the parameters studied&#xD;
      could be an indicator of PE risk.&#xD;
