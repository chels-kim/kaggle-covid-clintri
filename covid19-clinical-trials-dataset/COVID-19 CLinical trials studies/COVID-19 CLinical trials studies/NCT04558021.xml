  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the potential antiviral efficacy and safety of a novel&#xD;
      formulation of Niclosamide; a well-known antihelmintic agent, together with an established&#xD;
      COVID-19 treatment regimen in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of niclosamide from the&#xD;
      test product (Niclosamide 200 mg/10 mL Suspension) in patients treated for the novel&#xD;
      coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) in a placebo controlled phase III trial. Both&#xD;
      treatment groups will receive an established treatment regimen against COVID-19 together with&#xD;
      either niclosamide or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of the molecule is well-known and the properties of novel formulation&#xD;
      is well-established. The promising in vitro results of niclosamide as an antiviral compound&#xD;
      is well documented and make it an ideal candidate as a therapy against SARS-CoV 2 infection.&#xD;
      A good safety profile is expected with solid antiviral activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in accordance with the relevant articles of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki (1964) as revised in Tokyo (1975), Venice (1983), Hong Kong (1989), Somerset West,&#xD;
      RSA (1996), Edinburgh (2000), Washington (2002), Tokyo (2004) and Seoul (2008) and Fortaleza&#xD;
      (2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medications for the established treatment regimen will be supplied by Ministry of Health&#xD;
      to the study sites. The other study medications, Investigational product and placebo,&#xD;
      together with relative documentation, will be supplied to clinical sites by the sponsor.&#xD;
      Niclosamide 200 mg/10 mL Suspension and placebo will be supplied together with certificates&#xD;
      of analysis by the company responsible for manufacturing of the test product(s).The packaging&#xD;
      and labelling of niclosamide and placebo will be done according to the GMP and GCP&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive either 200 mg/10 mL niclosamide suspension or 10 mL placebo three&#xD;
      times a day for 5 days, together with an established COVID-19 treatment regimen according to&#xD;
      the official guidance for COVID-19 Adult Treatment Algorithm of Republic of Turkey Ministry&#xD;
      of Health. Dosings will be administered in accordance with the treatment randomization table&#xD;
      throughout the treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each drug administration, the identity of the subject will be confirmed by checking the&#xD;
      Identity Card. Administration of the study medication will be performed by the&#xD;
      investigator(s) and nurse(s) and supervised by a second medical professional to ensure the&#xD;
      correctness of drug administration. Also, a monitor may attend during this procedure. The&#xD;
      administration of the study medication is to be followed by a mouth check, to be documented&#xD;
      in the CRF and certified by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be done according to the provisions of ICH Topic E9,&#xD;
      Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (CPMP/ICH/363/96), September 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed as a valid case analysis including all subjects in&#xD;
      which no major protocol deviations occurred and all primary target variables are available&#xD;
      for measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject is to be excluded from evaluation, this decision has to be justified in the&#xD;
      Final Study Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as means ± standard deviations (SD) for the normally&#xD;
      distributed data or median with interquartile (IQR) for the skewed data. Correspondingly,&#xD;
      two-sample independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test will be used to detect the difference&#xD;
      between groups. Categorical variables will be described as number (%) and compared by χ² test&#xD;
      or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the&#xD;
      cumulative probability of the endpoint. Cox proportional hazards regression model will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine the potential risk factors associated with the endpoint. Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be defined as p&lt;α=0.0054 for interim analysis, p&lt;α=0.0492 for final&#xD;
      analysis using O'Brien-Fleming alpha adjustment. All analyses will be done with R project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected percentage of treatment success is 75% in the experimental group and 50% in the&#xD;
      control group. The sample size calculation yields that 170 subjects are needed (85 for each&#xD;
      group) to achieve 90% power at α=0.05. Considering potential dropouts, the sample size is&#xD;
      estimated as 200 subjects (100 subjects for each group). For interim analysis, 100 subjects&#xD;
      (50 subjects for each group) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being enrolled to the clinical study, the subject(s) must consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study by signing the informed consent form in response to a complete written and verbal&#xD;
      explanation of the nature, scope and possible consequences of the clinical study explained in&#xD;
      an understandable way for him/her by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will give in writing her/his authorization that the study data may be given for&#xD;
      review to the responsible Local and National Authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject information and informed consent form will be provided in duplicate [one signed&#xD;
      version (original 1) will be left at the investigator; the other signed version (original 2)&#xD;
      will be forwarded to the subject].&#xD;
