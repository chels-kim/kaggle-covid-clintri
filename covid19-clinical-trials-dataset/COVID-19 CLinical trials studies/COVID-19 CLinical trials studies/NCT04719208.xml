  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of prophylactic mouth rinses in&#xD;
      reducing the amount of viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity. This research&#xD;
      will guide dental and medical providers on best practices to be performed prior to dental and&#xD;
      medical procedures involving the oral cavity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to SARS-CoV-2 the dental and greater healthcare communities have devised ways to&#xD;
      combat the spread of the virus. Many dentists and physicians have advocated the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic oral rinses for reduction of COVID-19 viral load in all patients prior to&#xD;
      treatment in the oral pharyngeal cavity, but the effectiveness of these measures has not been&#xD;
      validated with empirical evidence. The investigators will test COVID-19 positive hospital&#xD;
      inpatients before and after the use of different combinations of oral rinses to provide&#xD;
      guidance on best measures for dental or medical treatment. This research is imperative and&#xD;
      essential as prophylactic rinses are already being used at AU and globally, without data to&#xD;
      support their effectiveness specifically in COVID-19 positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral rinses have been used as an industry standard in dentistry for decades to reduce oral&#xD;
      levels of pathogens including bacteria and viruses. According to the American Academy of&#xD;
      Dentistry mouth rinses can be broken down into two categories, cosmetic and therapeutic.&#xD;
      Those categorized as therapeutic include chlorhexidine, essential oils, fluoride, and&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide. These rinses are routinely used in both dental practices as well as in the&#xD;
      OR setting prior to any invasive procedure involving treatment of the oral cavity. However,&#xD;
      these mouth rinses, are typically utilized to reduce risk of infection to the patient. By&#xD;
      disinfecting the oral cavity through bacteriostatic, bactericidal, and virucidal rinses&#xD;
      practitioners can mitigate the risk of spreading an infection from a patient's mouth or the&#xD;
      outside environment to other parts of their body. Prophylactic rinses are often used prior to&#xD;
      routine dental procedures like fillings and cleaning to more invasive interventions like jaw&#xD;
      reconstruction and tumor resection. This simple, cheap and innocuous procedure is now being&#xD;
      used for a different purpose. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduction in the spread of&#xD;
      oral and respiratory borne viruses has become paramount in the global battle against&#xD;
      coronavirus. Both dentists and medical providers, including ear nose throat specialists and&#xD;
      anesthesiologists who routinely intubate patients, have implemented the use of these&#xD;
      virucidal mouth rinses to reduce viral loads of both COVID-19 positive and non-infected&#xD;
      patients. Dentists are particularly at risk for transmission of COVID-19 because they work&#xD;
      directly in the oral cavity where the virus resides and the work they do creates an enormous&#xD;
      amount of aerosols. In addition to a multitude of barrier and personal protective equipment&#xD;
      (PPE) techniques being implemented, prior to procedures in the oral cavity patients are asked&#xD;
      to rinse and spit different regimens of mouth rinses to reduce the chance of spreading&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While healthcare workers have had to act quickly to respond to the pandemic and reduce the&#xD;
      risk of spreading coronavirus, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support current&#xD;
      practices. Here the investigators aim to address three questions; 1: Does oral prophylaxis&#xD;
      effectively reduce oral viral load specifically of SARS-CoV-2; 2: If so for what duration is&#xD;
      oral prophylaxis effective before viral load recovers in the oral cavity; 3: Which&#xD;
      combination of virucidal prophylaxis if any is most effective.&#xD;
