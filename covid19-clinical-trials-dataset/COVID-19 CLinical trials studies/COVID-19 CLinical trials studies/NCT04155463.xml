  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand whether and how pregnant women may be exposed&#xD;
      to glyphosate, the active ingredient in a common herbicide. The researchers aim to assess&#xD;
      glyphosate exposure among pregnant women in Idaho, and to attribute that exposure to&#xD;
      agricultural and dietary sources. Pregnant women who live either near or far from&#xD;
      glyphosate-treated fields will be recruited for study inclusion, and exposure will be&#xD;
      assessed via urinary biomonitoring on a weekly basis throughout pregnancy. Each participant&#xD;
      will also take part in a two-week dietary intervention, during which they will receive one&#xD;
      week of organic food and one week of conventional food, in a crossover design. Urinary&#xD;
      biomonitoring will occur on a daily basis during the dietary intervention phase. The&#xD;
      researchers hypothesize that women who live near agricultural fields treated with glyphosate&#xD;
      will have higher exposures than those who live in non-agricultural regions, and that&#xD;
      consumption of an organic diet will reduce exposures in both groups. All study components&#xD;
      will be completed with no face-to-face interaction to eliminate all coronavirus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      related risks.&#xD;

      This study focuses on human exposure to glyphosate, the single most commonly applied&#xD;
      agricultural chemical in the world. Glyphosate is an herbicide, and is most commonly known as&#xD;
      the active ingredient in &quot;Round Up&quot;. Glyphosate has been declared a probable human carcinogen&#xD;
      by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and multiple toxicological studies have&#xD;
      further suggested potential neurological and developmental effects of glyphosate exposure at&#xD;
      environmentally-relevant levels. However, despite its extensive use, frequent presence in&#xD;
      food and environmental media, and potential toxicity, current exposure levels in human&#xD;
      populations are not well documented. This proposed study aims to assess glyphosate exposure&#xD;
      among a cohort of pregnant women and to quantify the relative contribution of agricultural&#xD;
      and dietary sources of this exposure. Specifically, this project has two main aims. Under Aim&#xD;
      1, a cohort of 40 pregnant women will be recruited from urban areas &gt;10 miles from the&#xD;
      nearest glyphosate-treated field and agricultural areas &lt;1 mile from the nearest&#xD;
      glyphosate-treated field. Urinary analysis from these women will be used to indicate the&#xD;
      number of repeated spot urine samples necessary to characterize glyphosate exposure over one&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy, and to quantify the effect of residential proximity to&#xD;
      glyphosate-treated fields on exposure. Under Aim 2, these same 40 participants will then take&#xD;
      part in a two week-long randomized cross-over design dietary intervention, during which&#xD;
      participants will receive one week of exclusively organic food (grown without the use of&#xD;
      synthetic pesticides, including glyphosate) and one week of exclusively conventional food, in&#xD;
      random order. During the intervention, the researchers will collect daily spot urine samples&#xD;
      from each participant to analyze for glyphosate exposure. The researchers hypothesize that&#xD;
      during the time of year when glyphosate is actively applied, women living near&#xD;
      glyphosate-treated fields will have higher exposures than those living further away. They&#xD;
      also hypothesize that glyphosate exposure will be reduced among participants during&#xD;
      randomization to the organic diet, but that this decrease will be larger among urban women&#xD;
      than among those living near glyphosate-treated fields. The researchers have taken extra&#xD;
      precautions to eliminate all COVID-specific risks. There will be no face-to-face contact&#xD;
      between research staff and study participants throughout the entire study. Interactions&#xD;
      between researchers and study participants will take place through videos, emails, texts,&#xD;
      and/or phone calls. All urine samples will be left for researchers to pick up at a&#xD;
      predetermined location and time, and all groceries will be delivered to participants' home&#xD;
      and left at their front door.&#xD;
