  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented stress on healthcare&#xD;
      systems in affected countries, and in particular, on the healthcare workers at the frontline&#xD;
      working directly with COVID-19 positive patients. Numerous lines of evidence support the&#xD;
      damaging impact of stress on our immune systems which increases susceptibility to infection.&#xD;
      Yet, the accurate measurement of immediate stress responses in real time and in naturalistic&#xD;
      settings has so far been a challenge, limiting our understanding of how different facets of&#xD;
      acute or sustained stress increases susceptibility. Our study utilizes wearable technologies&#xD;
      including an Oura smart ring as well as semi-continuous passive and active biometric&#xD;
      measurements carried out using individuals' own smartphones equipped with applications to&#xD;
      track and transmit key data to measure frontline workers stress and recovery during a&#xD;
      uniquely stressful and high-risk work environment.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Under the 4YouandMe open source model, we will make all data, findings, digital health applications and algorithms available in the public domain. Accordingly, de-identified data produced from this project will be shared broadly with qualified researchers (among participants who opt in) through Sage Bionetworks Synapse and will serve as an immense resource, reflecting a highly granular and high- dimensional map of physiological stress responses and knowledge surrounding inadvertent consequences of objective stress measurement. Only data from consenting participants will be shared through Sage Bionetworks Synapse. Additionally, Source code for the developed app will be made available as open source software on GitHub so it can be evolved for future work by others.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Internal collaborative researchers will have access to all coded data during the full duration of the study. Consented participants' coded data will be available in the Synapse at Sage Bionetworks for selected researchers to access indefinitely, one year after study completion.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>As coded study data will then exist among consenting participants in the Synapse at Sage Bionetworks in de-identified form, the electronic data files will be kept indefinitely. The Principal Investigator will be responsible for receipt and/or transmission of data as required.</ipd_access_criteria>
