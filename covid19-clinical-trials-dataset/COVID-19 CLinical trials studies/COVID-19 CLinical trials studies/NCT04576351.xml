      Neurologic, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, signs and diagnoses are&#xD;
      increasingly being reported in COVID-19 patients. However, the extent and implications of&#xD;
      such &quot;NeuroCOVID&quot; involvement, as well as blood and MRI biomarkers for neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric COVID-19-affection and treatments, warrants further studies. The investigator&#xD;
      will perform a national study with clinical and biomarker assessments of NeuroCOVID in&#xD;
      approximately 150 Norwegian patients, recruited from ongoing COVID-studies in Norway as well&#xD;
      as from neurological departments in Norway. The investigator will define the burden of&#xD;
      neurological, psychological and psychiatric complications of COVID-19 disease and identify&#xD;
      clinical characteristics and biomarkers for both short- and long-term neurological treatment&#xD;
      and rehabilitation. Blood samples for biomarker analyses, brain MRI, clinical neurological,&#xD;
      neurophysiological and neuropsychological assessments will be performed at 6 and 12 moths&#xD;
      after acute disease,&#xD;

      Corona virus (CoV) may have deleterious effects on the nervous system. As the number of&#xD;
      individuals infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is&#xD;
      increasing, more and more neurological, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are&#xD;
      being reported in COVID-19 patients. Neurologists and psychiatrist, in turn, may increasingly&#xD;
      find themselves involved in caring for patients with the novel virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sars-CoV-2 usually enter the body via the enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in&#xD;
      alveolar cells in the lungs. However, ACE2 is expressed in a number of other tissues and&#xD;
      cells, such as mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and oral cavity, neurons, glia cells and&#xD;
      endothelial cells, including those in the brain, making it a potential target of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several possible mechanisms for nervous system affection in COVID-19. Firstly,&#xD;
      transneuronal transport of viruses through the olfactory nerve to the brain can induce direct&#xD;
      injury. Sars-CoV-2 has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with encephalitis and&#xD;
      meningitis. A second type of injury may result from an excessive immune response in the form&#xD;
      of a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. Cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and are associated with&#xD;
      acute necrotizing encephalopathy. A third mechanism of nervous tissue damage results from&#xD;
      unintended host immune response effects after an acute infection. Examples of this type of&#xD;
      indirect CNS injury are Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and brain and spine demyelination. A&#xD;
      fourth mechanism is an indirect viral injury that results from the effects of systemic&#xD;
      illness, hypoxia and in some cases hypercoagulability, a prominent feature of severe&#xD;
      COVID-19. Most cases of COVID-19-related neurologic complications appear to fall into this&#xD;
      category. Severely ill patients in the intensive care unit may develop neurologic symptoms&#xD;
      such as encephalopathy, critical illness myopathy, and neuropathy. This is common in both&#xD;
      COVID-19 and in other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several reports of nervous system manifestations in COVID-19. In a&#xD;
      retrospective study from Wuhan China with 214 consecutive hospitalized patients, 1/3 had&#xD;
      neurologic manifestations and nearly one half of those with severe infection. Common central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) symptoms were dizziness, headache, and impaired consciousness or&#xD;
      symptoms of acute cerebrovascular disease. The most common peripheral nervous system (PNS)&#xD;
      symptoms included impaired taste, smell, or vision, and nerve pain. Skeletal muscular injury&#xD;
      symptoms were also frequently reported. COVID-19 patients with CNS symptoms had lower&#xD;
      lymphocyte levels and platelet counts and higher blood urea nitrogen levels compared to their&#xD;
      counterparts without CNS symptoms. This may be indicative of immunosuppression in patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 and CNS symptoms or it may be manifestations coexisting in the same patient.&#xD;
      Systematic brain imaging and measurements of neuron- or brain-specific biomarkers may&#xD;
      increase the knowledge regarding nervous system manifestations in COVID-19 but were not&#xD;
      performed in this study. Case report series with types of CNS or PNS manifestations, such as&#xD;
      ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, Guillain Barré syndrome, encephalitis, meningitis and toxic&#xD;
      hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy have been described. Furthermore, post infection&#xD;
      surveillance will be necessary to identify possible post-COVID neurologic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, COVID-19 is a significant psychological stressor, which may in addition to the&#xD;
      neurological manifestations contribute to neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological sequela.&#xD;
      Past respiratory viral pandemics have been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms that may&#xD;
      arise acutely or after variable periods of time. The long-term effect on neuropsychological&#xD;
      functioning and the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms due to COVID-19 are currently&#xD;
      unknown. However, patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing delirium that may cause&#xD;
      long term cognitive impairment. Furthermore, Sars-CoV-2 proteins have been shown to interact&#xD;
      with human proteins in multiple aging-related processes and CNS symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 may put them at risk of neurocognitive complications. Given the global burden of&#xD;
      COVID-19, long term neurocognitive complications are of importance to recognize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously anxiety, depression and trauma related symptoms have been associated with CoV&#xD;
      outbreaks. In survivors of SARS-CoV-1 active psychiatric illnesses were diagnosed in more&#xD;
      than 40%, (PTSD (54%), depression (39%), somatoform pain disorders (36%), panic disorder&#xD;
      (32%) and OCD (15%)) post-infection compared to pre-infection prevalence of less than 3%, and&#xD;
      more than 27% had fatigue symptoms. Moreover, antibodies against CoV have been found in both&#xD;
      psychoses and affective disorders. However, it is not known to which extent&#xD;
      neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms and disorders after COVID-19 are related to the&#xD;
      psychological stressor or to CNS sequela after Covid-19 or to both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses in this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nervous system manifestations and neurological sequelae are common after COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarkers in blood can be used to assess neurological manifestations and sequelae in&#xD;
           COVID-19 patients at 6- and 12-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe COVID-19 infection predicts neurological manifestations and sequelae at 6- and&#xD;
           12-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety and depressive disorders, but also psychotic&#xD;
           and somatoform disorders are common after COVID-19, either due to CNS sequelae or&#xD;
           manifestation or to perceived distress/strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Neuropsychological sequelae are common after COVID-19 either due to CNS sequelae or&#xD;
           manifestation or to perceived distress/strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biomarkers and imaging findings can be used to predict neuropsychiatric manifestations&#xD;
           after Covid-19 at 6- and 12- months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Biomarkers in blood and imaging findings can be used to predict neuropsychological&#xD;
           manifestations after Covid-19 at 6- and 12- months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Severe COVID-19 infection predicts neuropsychiatric and psychiatric disorders at 6- and&#xD;
           12-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Severe COVID-19 infection predicts neuropsychological sequelae at 6- and 12-months&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
