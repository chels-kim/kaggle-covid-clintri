    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Tigerase® (GENERIUM JSC, Russia) with standard therapy versus standard therapy in patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The spread of the disease quickly developed to the global pandemic in&#xD;
      March-April 2020, and was characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in&#xD;
      10-15% of cases, which leads to a high frequency of hospitalization in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit and high mortality. The search for effective treatment and reducing the severity of&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a priority in the development of medical science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key processes of the innate immune system are neutrophil extracellular traps&#xD;
      (NET), formed by neutrophils when they eject their DNA from the cytoplasm. NET is most often&#xD;
      described as a mechanism for capturing bacteria in order to limit their spread. In addition,&#xD;
      NET also plays a role in antiviral immunity. In particular, viral infections lung damage is&#xD;
      at least partially due to NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This suggests that drug disruption of NET in COVID-19 is promising. DNase preparations, and&#xD;
      in particular Tigerase®, are safe and effective for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and can&#xD;
      serve as a NET destruction agent in patient with COVID-19.&#xD;
