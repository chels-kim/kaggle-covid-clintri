    <description>Patient records of patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 infection until 01.06.2020 that required oxygen therapy will be used to retrospectively gather baseline demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, ethnicity/race, blood group, rhesus factor) and comorbidities. Records will also be used to retrospectively gather information on routine coagulation and laboratory parameters measured as per local protocols (including where available: AT, aPTT, PT, Quick, INR, , fibrinogen, D-dimers, haemoglobin levels, and platelet count), and thromboembolic complications and bleeding events that occurred during the individual observational treatment period. Patients will be grouped into 2 cohorts; those that received treatment with ATIII and those that did not. ATIII was administered as per local guidelines at each institute.</description>
