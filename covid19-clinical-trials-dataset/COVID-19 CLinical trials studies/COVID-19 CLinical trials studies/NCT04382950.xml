      B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure.&#xD;
      Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an&#xD;
      ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis,&#xD;
      B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. A&#xD;
      study demonstrated that the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating&#xD;
      that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial&#xD;
      engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart&#xD;
      failure. pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly down regulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II&#xD;
      levels at 5 min after Ang II injection In addition to the currently used drugs to inhibit Ang&#xD;
      II generation or signaling, such as ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, direct&#xD;
      down-modulation of Ang II levels by rhACE2 protein is one of the promising candidates for new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular disease and other Ang II-related diseases, e.g. ARDS.&#xD;
      On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to&#xD;
      requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli&#xD;
      expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse&#xD;
      heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial&#xD;
      carboxypeptidases in disease models. Finally the principal investigator expects that&#xD;
      treatment with ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP expected to work efficiently Like human&#xD;
      ACE2 and it will save the lung cells from COVID - 19 inhibitory effect and down regulation of&#xD;
      ACE2 because COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 and down regulates it and this receptors is very&#xD;
      important for lung cells survival and function So ,the principal investigator also expects&#xD;
      that B38-CAP ACE2 like enzyme may be not recognized by COVID -19 spike protein because&#xD;
      evolutionary it is too far away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID&#xD;
      -19 not ACE2 like enzyme but in the same time it will make the same function of human ACE2 In&#xD;
      another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP)&#xD;
      dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000&#xD;
      small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the&#xD;
      other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical&#xD;
      trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan,&#xD;
      lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly&#xD;
      alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a&#xD;
      Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by&#xD;
      performing target-based virtual ligand screening . So, the principal investigator expects&#xD;
      strong inhibition of COVID - 19 infection And rescuing the lung cells from its serious attack&#xD;
      by treating with ACE2 like enzyme and Isotretinoin&#xD;

      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants&#xD;
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It&#xD;
      is expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The&#xD;
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine&#xD;
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of&#xD;
           active combination drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving&#xD;
           at least one dose of active drug. It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24&#xD;
           subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to have at least 12 evaluable patients in each&#xD;
           group.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three&#xD;
      strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and&#xD;
      widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only&#xD;
      scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of&#xD;
      membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.&#xD;
      Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of&#xD;
      angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and&#xD;
      thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory&#xD;
      protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2&#xD;
      receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the&#xD;
      membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted&#xD;
      effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1&#xD;
      receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several&#xD;
      features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.&#xD;
      We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental&#xD;
      in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional&#xD;
      ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the 'adverse'&#xD;
      ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the 'protective' ACE2→Angiotensin1-7→Mas receptor&#xD;
      axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and&#xD;
      thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by&#xD;
      angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant brACE2 could be promising therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescuing The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by B38-CAP ACE2 which is a bacteria-derived&#xD;
      ACE2-like enzyme&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits of B38-CAP derived ACE2-like enzyme depending on previous research data&#xD;
      show that B38-CAP derived ACE2-like enzyme will do the same function of human ACE2 and in the&#xD;
      same time it will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because evolutionary it is too far&#xD;
      away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID -19 not ACE2 like enzyme and&#xD;
      this discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure.&#xD;
      Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an&#xD;
      ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis,&#xD;
      B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In&#xD;
      vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin&#xD;
      1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed&#xD;
      angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover,&#xD;
      B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis,&#xD;
      and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like&#xD;
      carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a&#xD;
      human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein&#xD;
      drugs for hypertension and heart failure. On the contrary Treatment with recombinant human&#xD;
      ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models including heart failure,&#xD;
      acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth. rhACE2 is currently tested in the&#xD;
      clinic to treat ARDS and COVID-19 infected patients . Using cell cultures and organoids,&#xD;
      researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of British Columbia&#xD;
      (UBC) in Canada, showed that by adding a genetically modified variant of ACE2, called human&#xD;
      recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hrsACE2), COVID-19 was prevented from&#xD;
      entering cells. The paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect&#xD;
      of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell&#xD;
      cultures. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein and thus its&#xD;
      preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein expression system with mammalian or&#xD;
      insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug development and medical economy Although&#xD;
      it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of&#xD;
      rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not observed for B38-CAP; there&#xD;
      were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang&#xD;
      II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate. These results&#xD;
      indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the principle&#xD;
      investigator expects and suggests that treating with cloned Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like&#xD;
      enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug&#xD;
      better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to&#xD;
      attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus from infecting&#xD;
      the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of the virus in the&#xD;
      lungs and other organs. A study showed that recombinant B38-CAP protein downregulates Ang II&#xD;
      levels in mice and antagonizes Ang II-induced hypertension, pathological cardiac hypertrophy,&#xD;
      and myocardial fibrosis. A study showed beneficial effects of B38-CAP on the pathology of&#xD;
      pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt toxicities and also&#xD;
      pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly downregulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II levels at&#xD;
      5 min after Ang II injection In addition to the currently used drugs to inhibit Ang II&#xD;
      generation or signaling, such as ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, direct&#xD;
      down-modulation of Ang II levels by rhACE2 protein is one of the promising candidates for new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular disease and other Ang II-related diseases, e.g. ARDS.&#xD;
      On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to&#xD;
      requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli&#xD;
      expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse&#xD;
      heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial&#xD;
      carboxypeptidases in disease models. Furthermore, human ACE2-like enzyme in bacteria might&#xD;
      pave the way to a new strategy to engineer evolution of bacterial proteins for better&#xD;
      designing and preparations of recombinant protein drugs Finally the principal investigator&#xD;
      expect that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme in bacteria B38-CAP may be do the same mechanism&#xD;
      of rhACE2 in inhibiting COVID -19 and the other suggested mechanism is that ACE2-like enzyme&#xD;
      in bacteria B38-CAP injection in human body will do the same function of human ACE2 and in&#xD;
      the same time it will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because evolutionary it is too far&#xD;
      away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID -19 not ACE2 like enzyme and&#xD;
      Also among three bacterial carboxypeptidases we tested, only B38-CAP showed dependence of&#xD;
      proteolytic activity on anion concentration, which is characteristic of ACE2 activity.&#xD;
      B38-CAP also showed pH optimum of 7.5 equivalent to rhACE2.In addition, IC50 of MLN-4760 was&#xD;
      also equivalent between rhACE2 and B38-CAP. Although B38-CAP exhibited quite similar&#xD;
      proteolytic activity to rhACE2, there seems a difference in substrate specificity between two&#xD;
      enzymes So , the principal investigator also expects that B38-CAP ACE2 like enzyme may be not&#xD;
      recognized by COVID -19 spike protein but in the same time it will make the same function of&#xD;
      human ACE2 in addition to down regulating of human ACE2 which is the real receptor of COVID&#xD;
      -19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blocking of ACE2 receptor of COVID -19 which is the real receptors of it&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2&#xD;
      via action like shRNA targeting ACE2 gene expression and this is discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over&#xD;
      150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues&#xD;
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart,&#xD;
      kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A&#xD;
      study demonstrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher&#xD;
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)&#xD;
      or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to&#xD;
      increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available&#xD;
      Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in&#xD;
      cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of&#xD;
      ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being&#xD;
      investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide,&#xD;
      methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of&#xD;
      which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study&#xD;
      demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which&#xD;
      is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be&#xD;
      targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening as the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2.&#xD;
      and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit and downregulat ACE2 expression&#xD;
      ,Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.&#xD;
