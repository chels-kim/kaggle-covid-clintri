      Сonducting in-depth medical and biological studies of the pathogenesis of the disease caused&#xD;

      Federation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To date, none of the methods used to test for coronavirus infection provide reliable&#xD;
      information about the status of an individual's infection. Common tests based on PCR, carried&#xD;
      out on the basis of samples taken from the human respiratory tract, give a positive answer in&#xD;
      far from all cases. Antibody tests may not record the initial stages of the disease, or may&#xD;
      not reveal residual immunity in those who have been ill, while giving cross-reactions to&#xD;
      other common coronaviruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive assessment of the biological parameters of the virus and the parameters of&#xD;
      the immune response to infection is required. In this regard, we propose an integrated&#xD;
      approach, including the use of PCR testing technology, analysis of the immune response in the&#xD;
      form of antibodies of all major classes (IgG, IgA), determination of inflammation markers,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, detailed blood test, ferritin and troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an analysis of the genetic diversity of strains of the pathogen COVID-19&#xD;
      circulating among various groups of the population of the Russian Federation will be carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect and analyze data, it is planned to enter information into a special electronic&#xD;
      system and analyze the collected data with a wide range of informative methods that allow&#xD;
      &quot;layer by layer&quot; to compare and collect a complete picture of what is happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identifying the percentage of infected in the population in Moscow, the Moscow region&#xD;
           and some other regions where the epidemic situation in connection with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           remains tense;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study of genetic diversity (including metavirome) and dynamics of structural variability&#xD;
           of the causative agent of coronavirus infection in the studied regions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Studying the features of the formation and tension of immunity in patients who have&#xD;
           undergone coronavirus infection of varying severity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clarification of the mechanisms of occurrence and development of coronavirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study of biological samples obtained from research participants, methods of&#xD;
      proteomics, peptidomics, next generation sequencing (NGS), physicochemical methods of&#xD;
      analysis will be used.&#xD;
