  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NasoVAX in&#xD;
      preventing worsening of symptoms and hospitalization in patients with early COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patient volunteers that have&#xD;
      given written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. If the patient qualifies for the study, they will be randomized in a double-blind&#xD;
      manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive NasoVAX or placebo. On the same day of qualifying into the&#xD;
      study, the patient will be administered the investigational drug (either NasoVAX or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return home for the remainder of the study. During this period, the patient&#xD;
      will be monitored remotely by the study center for clinical status. The patient will also be&#xD;
      contacted by study center personnel by telephone to ask about use of any medications and&#xD;
      changes in health including information about any hospitalization.&#xD;
