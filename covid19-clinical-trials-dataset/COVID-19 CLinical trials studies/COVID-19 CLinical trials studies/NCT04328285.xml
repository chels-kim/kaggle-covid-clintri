  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the emergence of a new coronavirus named SARS-Cov-2 in the city of Wuhan&#xD;
      in China has been responsible for a major epidemic of respiratory infections, including&#xD;
      severe pneumonia. Within weeks, COVID-19 became a pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of specific antiviral treatment, a special attention should be given to&#xD;
      prevention. Personal protection equipments may be insufficiently protective, including in&#xD;
      healthcare workers, a significant proportion of whom (around 4%) having been infected in the&#xD;
      outbreaks described in China and more recently in Italy. Infection in healthcare workers&#xD;
      could result from the contact with COVID-19 people in community or with infected colleagues&#xD;
      or patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it will take at least a year before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available,&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis is an option that should be considered in this setting where prevention of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVIDAXIS trial evaluates a chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care&#xD;
      Workers. This trial is divided into two distinct studies that could start independently each&#xD;
      with its own randomization process: COVIDAXIS 1 will study Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus&#xD;
      placebo; COVIDAXIS 2 will study Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon randomization healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the management of suspected or&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study COVIDAXIS 1(Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus placebo) will be realized on 600&#xD;
      participants and will be implemented first in as many centers as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon randomization, with 1:1 allocation ratio, healthcare workers involved in the management&#xD;
      of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1.1: HCQ 200 mg : 2 tablets on the evening at Day 1 and 2 tablets on the morning&#xD;
           at Day 2 and 1 tablet once daily afterwards&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1.2: Placebo of HCQ, 2 tablets on the evening at Day 1 and 2 tablets on the&#xD;
           morning at Day 2 and 1 tablet once daily afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVIDAXIS 2 (Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo will be realized on 600&#xD;
      participants and will be implemented in already participating and newer centers in a second&#xD;
      step (when LPV/r becomes available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon randomization, with 1:1 allocation ratio, healthcare workers involved in the management&#xD;
      of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2.1: LPV/r 200/50 mg : 2 tablets twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2.2: Placebo of LPV/r, 2 tablets twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the randomized treatment for 2 months and will be followed upon a&#xD;
      2.5 months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB: there is no randomization procedure for participant inclusion in either COVIDAXIS 1 or&#xD;
      COVIDAXIS 2&#xD;
