      In this study, the effects of the symptoms related to the diseases of patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia during the COVID-19 pandemic, their limitations in their social and business&#xD;
      life, the need for different drugs, stress levels and the effect of the pandemic on the&#xD;
      disease activity will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychological stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the severity and&#xD;
      duration of physical pain. However, when added to the economic stress due to social&#xD;
      isolation, pain may worsen in patients with chronic pain, especially fibromyalgia, prone to&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. Due to the fact that many occupational sectors, which concern the&#xD;
      whole society, have come to a halt, being obliged to live a sedentary life due to inability&#xD;
      to perform their profession may have caused an increase in the body mass index of people.&#xD;
      During the pandemic days, our concentration and health services may have shifted from the&#xD;
      diseases of our branch to COVID-19 and the branch health services offered may be disrupted.&#xD;
      However, the call of the country administrators to stay home and the concept of social&#xD;
      isolation caused the routine outpatient clinic follow-ups to be delayed. Lack of sufficient&#xD;
      data on how fibromyalgia patients were affected in previous pandemics and the pandemic we are&#xD;
      in, the disease levels of the patients in this period, restrictions in their social&#xD;
      environment, difficulties in reaching the doctor may have exacerbated the course of the&#xD;
      diseases. In this study, the effects of the symptoms related to the diseases of patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia during the COVID-19 pandemic, their limitations in their social and business&#xD;
      life, the need for different drugs, stress levels and the effect of the pandemic on the&#xD;
      disease activity will be evaluated. The data to be obtained can be a guiding resource for us&#xD;
      in the ongoing pandemic and in the fight against future pandemics due to the mutated genetic&#xD;
      structure of the virus.&#xD;
