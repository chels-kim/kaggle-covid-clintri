    <textblock>
      The study consists of 3 sub-studies, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study 1 (Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study) to evaluate the&#xD;
           efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo as maintenance therapy in&#xD;
           participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) who responded to&#xD;
           risankizumab induction treatment in Study M16-006 or Study M15-991&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study 2 (Randomized, exploratory maintenance study) to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
           safety of two different dosing regimens for risankizumab as maintenance therapy in&#xD;
           participants who responded to induction treatment in Study M16-006 or Study M15-991;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study 3 (Open-label, long-term extension study) to evaluate long-term safety of&#xD;
           risankizumab in participants who completed Sub-study 1, Sub-study 2 or the Phase 2,&#xD;
           open-label extension study M15-989, or participants who responded to induction treatment&#xD;
           in Study M16-006 or Study M15-991 with no final endoscopy due to the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;

    <measure>Sub-Study 3: Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 220</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>
