    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, Open-Label Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Aralast NP Infusion&#xD;
      Therapy with Antiviral Treatment and standard of care versus Antiviral Treatment and standard&#xD;
      of care (control group) in Hospitalized Patients with Pneumonia and COVID-19 Infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 subjects in total will be randomized with 1:1 ratio to the high dose of&#xD;
      Aralast NP infusion therapy plus antiviral and standard of care versus antiviral therapy and&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in the study for 24 days and have one safety follow-up phone&#xD;
      call at 30 days. Active treatment will last 17 days, subject will be dosed on Days 1, 3, 5,&#xD;
      7, 9 and have a final booster infusion on Day 17. If the subject is discharged from hospital,&#xD;
      any remaining infusions and assessments will be conducted via outpatient clinic visit or home&#xD;
      health visit. Subjects will have an in-person visit (hospital or clinic) on Day 24 for a CT&#xD;
      scan and follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the duration of new non-invasive ventilation or high&#xD;
      flow oxygen used. Additional endpoints include clinical status, cytokine levels, oxygen&#xD;
      requirements, SOFA scores, risk of coagulopathy, need for Vasopressors, mortality during the&#xD;
      treatment period, PK samples, average days spent in the hospital/ICU, and number of days&#xD;
      without a fever.&#xD;

    <description>The investigational product is alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, administered as a loading dose of 120mg/kg/body weight intravenous infusion on the first day, and then 60mg/kg/BW intravenous infusion on Days 3, 5, 7 and 9. Booster infusion of 120 mg/kg/BWon Day 17.&#xD;
The Antiviral treatment is Remdesivir. For patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO, the recommended total treatment duration is 5 days. If a patient does not demonstrate clinical improvement, treatment may be extended for up to 5 additional days for a total treatment duration of up to 10 days. Recommended dosage in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg: a single loading dose of Remdesivir 200 mg on Day 1 followed by once-daily maintenance doses of Remdesivir 100 mg from Day 2 infused over 30 to 120 minutes&#xD;
Standard of Care treatments are at the investigator's discretion based on best practices.</description>
