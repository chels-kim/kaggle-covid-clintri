  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of the Grand Hôpital de Charleroi hospital authorized the performance of a&#xD;
      serology for each member of the establishment's staff in order to better characterize the&#xD;
      proportion of its employees who have already been in contact with the SARS CoV-2 virus for&#xD;
      organizational and evaluation purposes symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several workers had symptoms compatible with&#xD;
      COVID-19 at a time when PCR (smear) testing was only allowed for hospitalized people. In&#xD;
      addition, the PCR test has a fairly low sensitivity. In this context, serology can make it&#xD;
      possible to determine whether the symptoms are indeed linked to exposure to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a hospital, and in order to prepare for a possible second epidemic wave, it is also useful&#xD;
      to know the proportion of staff members who have already been in contact with the virus for&#xD;
      organizational purposes and symptom assessment.&#xD;
