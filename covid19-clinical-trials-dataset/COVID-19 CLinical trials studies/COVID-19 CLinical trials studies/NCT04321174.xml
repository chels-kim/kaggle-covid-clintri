  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has rapidly evolved into a generalized global pandemic. Post-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PEP) against on COVID-19 was identified as an urgent research priority by the WHO, and&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is a promising candidate for both COVID-19 treatment and PEP,&#xD;
      with a good safety profile and global availability. This is a cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) of oral LPV/r as PEP against COVID-19, that will address the immediate need for&#xD;
      preventive interventions, generate key data on COVID-19 transmission, and serve as a research&#xD;
      platform for future vaccines and preventive agents.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. High risk close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case during their symptomatic&#xD;
             period, including one day before symptom onset, within the past 1-7 days. High risk&#xD;
             close contact is defined as any of the following exposures without the consistent&#xD;
             appropriate use of recommended personal protective equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Provided direct care for the index case&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Had close physical contact with the index case&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Lived with the index case&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Had close contact (within 2 metres), without direct physical contact, for a&#xD;
                  prolonged period of time&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Had direct contact with infectious body fluids, including oral secretions,&#xD;
                  respiratory secretions, or stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Successfully contacted by the study team within 24 hours of study team notification of&#xD;
             the relevant index COVID-19 case. This time window is necessary because the efficacy&#xD;
             of PEP may be dependent on the timing of its initiation, and because randomization of&#xD;
             a ring cannot be delayed while awaiting response from contacts that cannot be rapidly&#xD;
             reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥6 months, since the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of LPV/r in pediatric&#xD;
             patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability to communicate with study staff in English&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known hypersensitivity/allergy to lopinavir or ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current use of LPV/r for the treatment or prevention of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of LPV/r in the context of this trial or any other trial of COVID-19 PEP&#xD;
             within 2 days or less prior to the last known contact with the index COVID-19 case.&#xD;
             The two day time window is intended to ensure that exposure would not have occurred in&#xD;
             the presence of clinically relevant drug levels (five times the elimination half-life&#xD;
             of LPV/r, which is estimated at 4-6 hours with prolonged use).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Baseline respiratory tract specimen positive for COVID-19. Randomized participants&#xD;
             whose baseline samples subsequently show COVID-19 will have study drug discontinued&#xD;
             but still remain under observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current breastfeeding, due to potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing&#xD;
             infants exposed to LPV/r&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concomitant medications with prohibited drug interactions with LPV/r that cannot be&#xD;
             temporarily suspended/replaced, including but not restricted to: 37&#xD;

               -  St. John's Wort&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tadalafil (e.g. Adcirca®)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  venetoclax (e.g. Venclexta®)&#xD;

               -  lovastatin (e.g., Mevacor®*), lomitapide (e.g., JuxtapidTM) or simvastatin (e.g.,&#xD;
                  Zocor®)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  vardenafil (e.g., Levitra® or Staxyn®)&#xD;
