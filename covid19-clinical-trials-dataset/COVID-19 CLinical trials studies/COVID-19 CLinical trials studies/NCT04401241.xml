  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      December 2019 was the onset of an outbreak of an infection related to SARS-CoV-2, a new&#xD;
      coronavirus detected in January 2020 and responsible for a disorder termed COVID-19. Since&#xD;
      then, COVID-19 has spread worldwide and is responsible for an unprecedented pandemic with&#xD;
      major threat on global health and social and economic stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 has a large spectrum of symptoms. Most patients experience mild or moderate flu-like&#xD;
      disorder with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. More severe presentations may occur;&#xD;
      patients sometimes develop an acute pneumonia that can lead to adult respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome. A considerable number of publications have been released for the last 10 weeks to&#xD;
      help physicians making diagnosis and treat patients. Chinese authors have extensively&#xD;
      proposed description of the disease. As signs and symptoms are poorly specific, diagnosis&#xD;
      mostly relies on detection of the virus by RT-PCR in the upper respiratory tract. Some&#xD;
      uncommon images and localization are highly specific and sensitive on chest CT-scan, which is&#xD;
      cornerstone for initial diagnosis. However, resources may lack during healthcare crisis and&#xD;
      results of these investigations may be delayed or unavailable developper. Special attention&#xD;
      should also be paid to usual laboratory analysis. Indeed, decreased lymphocytes and&#xD;
      eosinophilic counts are frequently described as well as increase in D-dimers levels.&#xD;
      Variation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) have been reported. Coronavirus&#xD;
      may have cardiac tropism and changes in cardiac biomarkers concentration may occur.&#xD;
      Therefore, some data suggest that values of routine biomarkers and blood cell count may&#xD;
      assist physicians at bedside to support diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To face the outbreak, organization of emergency departments (ED) was mandatory to separate&#xD;
      patients flows and avoid mixing patients with COVID-19 and others. Most patients visiting EDs&#xD;
      dedicated to initial COVID-19 management suffered of pneumonia-like symptoms. Despite initial&#xD;
      triage, patients had either COVID-19-related pneumonia either alternative diagnoses. We took&#xD;
      advantage of this to evaluate the ability of routine biomarkers and leucocytes count helping&#xD;
      identification of COVID-19 from alternative diagnoses.&#xD;

      Methods Setting Investigator designed a single center, retrospective, observational study&#xD;
      conducted from February 2020 to April 2020 in the emergency department (ED) of Princesse&#xD;
      Grace Hospital center, a general hospital in Monaco. The study was monitored by the research&#xD;
      department of the Hospital Center. No specific funding was obtained for this study. The&#xD;
      institutional review board for the protection of human subjects approved the study protocol&#xD;
      and waved the need for written informed consent for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective was to assess sensitivity of routine biomarkers and blood&#xD;
      cell count for diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia in low and high probability groups for&#xD;
      level of certainty using the adjudication committee classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives were :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare values in the four different categories of level of certainty and between low&#xD;
           and high probability groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess performance of combined routine biomarkers and blood cell count for diagnosis&#xD;
           of COVID-19-related pneumonia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess whether usual biomarkers and blood cell count were associated with diagnosis&#xD;
           of COVID-19-related pneumonia using sensitivity analyses in two predefinite subgroups&#xD;
           chosen a priori; Group 1 : when considering patients classified as having low&#xD;
           probability and high probability COVID-19-related pneumonia; Group 2 : when patients&#xD;
           with excluded COVID-19-related pneumonia and diagnosed extra-pulmonary infectious&#xD;
           disease were not taken into account, in the low probability COVID-19-related pneumonia&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjudication committee Based on data collected from baseline on standardized case report&#xD;
      forms, results of low dose chest CT-scan, of SARS-Cov-2 specific RT-PCR, and full access to&#xD;
      all available data including patients' discharge summary, an adjudication committee&#xD;
      consisting of three independent senior experts in infectious diseases, pneumology and&#xD;
      radiology retrospectively assigned the probability of COVID-19-related pneumonia diagnosis&#xD;
      using the 4-level Likert scale. For this study, the gold standard was the diagnosis assessed&#xD;
      by the adjudication committee. Alternative diagnoses were established for low probability&#xD;
      COVID-19-related pneumonia and classified as non-COVID pulmonary diseases and extra-pulmonary&#xD;
      infectious diseases and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Likert scale allowed distribution of patients in four categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. absence of COVID-19-related pneumonia hereafter referred to as excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. possible COVID-19-related pneumonia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. probable COVID-19-related pneumonia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. definite COVID-19-related pneumonia. After this first classification, patients were&#xD;
           distributed in two groups: low probability COVID-19-related pneumonia (excluded and&#xD;
           possible) and high probability COVID-19-related pneumonia (probable and definite).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population For the study purpose and to ensure quality of the final adjudication&#xD;
      committee diagnosis, investigator selected consecutive adults (18 years of age and above)&#xD;
      visiting the COVID-19-dedicated ED if they presented with clinically suspected&#xD;
      COVID-19-related pneumonia and had SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR and/or low dose chest CT-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management and usual biomarkers and blood cell count Patients' management in the&#xD;
      COVID-19-dedicated ED was based on local protocoled practices based upon collegial&#xD;
      multidisciplinary decision if they presented with suspected COVID-19-related pneumonia.&#xD;
      Recorded baseline data consisted of demographic data (age, gender), coexisting illnesses,&#xD;
      treatments, symptoms, clinical findings and predetermined laboratory tests including:&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 specific RT-PCR obtained on nasopharyngeal swab; low-dose chest CT-scan; standard&#xD;
      blood analysis (complete blood count, hemostasis, metabolic panel, creatinine, blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen, liver enzymes), D-dimers (Vidas, Biomérieux), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), high sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT-hs, Cobas, Roche diagnostics), NT-pro-brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, Cobas, Roche diagnostics). For each individual, CRB65 and&#xD;
      Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological samples Naso-pharyngeal swabs were collected at admission and placed in a&#xD;
      Middle Virocult MWE (Sigma®) transport medium. Samples were kept at room temperature and sent&#xD;
      to the laboratory immediately after collection. For the presence of SARS-COV-2, swabs were&#xD;
      sent to French referent centers of virology (Nice, Marseille, Paris). Routine microbiological&#xD;
      examinations were also performed at the discretion of the emergency physicians and included :&#xD;
      presence of influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B on&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs, blood culture, urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and&#xD;
      Legionella pneumophila type I, serodiagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. These results were&#xD;
      available to the adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose chest CT-scan data and COVID-19-related pneumonia diagnosis classification&#xD;
      Multidetector low dose thoracic CT-scan was performed for each individual patient and&#xD;
      interpretation was recorded using a standardized report form according to guidelines. The&#xD;
      level of COVID-19-related pneumonia probability according to low dose chest CT scan were&#xD;
      defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Baseline and follow-up characteristics were described by means and&#xD;
      standard deviations (SD) or by median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables&#xD;
      with normal or with skewed distribution, respectively, and by percentages for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were performed when appropriate for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. The Student or Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare baseline characteristics&#xD;
      and study outcomes between study groups for continuous variables with skewed distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of values for usual biomarkers and blood cell count were determined in the&#xD;
      different populations of patients using boxplots. The performances of current laboratory data&#xD;
      in predicting definite COVID-19-related pneumonia were evaluated by sensitivity analysis&#xD;
      (definite vs excluded COVID-19-related pneumonia). CRP was evaluated at several cut-off&#xD;
      points of 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 70 mg/L, and 100 mg/L, values used in previous studies.&#xD;
      Several cut-off points for PCT were chosen at the level of 0.10 μg/L, and at the two levels&#xD;
      for suspected bacterial infection as stated by the manufacturer, i.e., 0.25 μg/L and 0.50&#xD;
      μg/L. Cut-offs for cTnT-hs were 0.014ng/mL and 50ng/mL. Cut-offs for D-dimers test were&#xD;
      500µg/ml and age-adjusted threshold. Sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values&#xD;
      (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and likelihood ratio were calculated. Receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn, area under the curve AUC was computed and&#xD;
      optimal cut-off was identified by the maximization of the Youden's index, comparing&#xD;
      laboratory results values in patients with excluded COVID-19-related pneumonia and definite&#xD;
      COVID-19-related pneumonia. From these optimal cut-offs for laboratory results, sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses were performed combining cut-offs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate logistic regression model was built to identify factors associated with having&#xD;
      definite COVID-19-related pneumonia as compared to having an excluded COVID-19-related&#xD;
      pneumonia diagnosis. Investigator excluded from the excluded CAP diagnosis group, patients&#xD;
      with an extra-pulmonary infectious disease. All variables with a p value of &lt; 0.25 in the&#xD;
      bivariate analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic regression with a backward&#xD;
      stepwise approach; the discrimination was evaluated by the C-index and its 95 % confidence&#xD;
      interval (95 % CI) and the calibration was evaluated by the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests were two-sided, and p-values below 0.05 were considered to denote statistical&#xD;
      significance. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software version&#xD;
      21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
