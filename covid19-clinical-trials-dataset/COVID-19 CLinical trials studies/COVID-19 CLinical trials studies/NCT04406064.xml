  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the use of viral specific&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes (VSTs) when given in the presence of COVID-19 signs and symptoms, caused by the&#xD;
      virus SARS-CoV-2. VSTs are cells specially designed to fight viral infections. These cells&#xD;
      are created from a blood sample collected from a donor who has recovered from COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. VSTs are investigational meaning that they are not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a new virus and treatment options are evolving rapidly. VSTs have been&#xD;
      successfully used to treat many different viral infections and may be beneficial in treating&#xD;
      COVID-19 in the absence of other treatments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The use of steroids to treat COVID prevents the use of VSTs for these patients. The Principal&#xD;
    Investigator does not feel the study had an expectation of enrolling patients as the treatment&#xD;
    options for COVID have evolved.&#xD;
