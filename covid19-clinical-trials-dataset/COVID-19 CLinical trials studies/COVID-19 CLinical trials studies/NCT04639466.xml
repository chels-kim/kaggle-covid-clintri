      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects and best dose of COH04S1, a synthetic modified&#xD;
      vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, for the prevention of COVID-19. COVID-19 is&#xD;
      caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated the capability to spread rapidly,&#xD;
      leading to significant impacts on healthcare systems and causing societal disruption. COH04S1&#xD;
      was created by placing small pieces of SARS-CoV-2 DNA (the chemical form of genes) into&#xD;
      synthetic MVA, which may be able to induce immunity (the ability to recognize and fight&#xD;
      against an infection) to SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      the optimal dose of the COH04S1 vaccine.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety and tolerability of the COH04S1 vaccine at three different dose levels (DL):&#xD;
      1.0x10e7 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/dose, 1.0x10e8 PFU/dose, and 2.5x10e8 PFU/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Longitudinal evaluation of humoral immunity. II. Quality and properties of cellular and&#xD;
      humoral immunity elicited as a result of the vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore the role of two injections versus one injection, and evaluate a placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Surveillance for incidental coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during follow-up (1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive COH04S1 intramuscularly (IM) in the non-dominant upper arm on day&#xD;
      0 and day 28 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive COH04S1 IM in the non-dominant upper arm on day 0 and placebo IM&#xD;
      in the non-dominant upper arm on day 28 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Participants receive placebo IM in the non-dominant upper arm on day 0 and day 28 in&#xD;
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed up at 7, 14, 35, 42, 56, 90, 120, 180, 270, and 365 days.&#xD;
