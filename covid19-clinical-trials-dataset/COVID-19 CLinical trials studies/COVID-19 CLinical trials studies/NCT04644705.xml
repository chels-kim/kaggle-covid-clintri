  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niclosamide is a well-established substance that is a promising candidate for a repurposing&#xD;
      approach to treat COVID-19. Niclosamide is currently marketed as a chewing tablet for the&#xD;
      treatment of intestinal worm infections. The marketed formulation is optimized for minimal&#xD;
      drug substance absorption. A niclosamide solution has been developed that is expected to&#xD;
      release the drug substance more readily and more reproducibly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camostat is approved for oral treatment of chronic pancreatitis and reflux oesophagitis in&#xD;
      Japan. Camostat has been shown to effectively block viral replication in a SARS-CoV-2 animal&#xD;
      model. Since the mechanisms of actions are different, it was hypothesized that a combination&#xD;
      of both substances might have an additive or even synergistic effect in the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 3-part study is designed to investigate (1) safety and pharmacokinetics of single&#xD;
      ascending doses of the new niclosamide solution after fasted and fed conditions, (2) the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability of the niclosamide solution compared to the chewing tablet, and (3)&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetics of the combination of niclosamide solution and camostat after&#xD;
      multiple doses in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
