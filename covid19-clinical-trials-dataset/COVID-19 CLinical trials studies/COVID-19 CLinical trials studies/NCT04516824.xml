  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the frightful outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China and its evidence of being&#xD;
      contagious, governments around the world particularly United States in an effort to stop the&#xD;
      transmission- imposed travel restrictions to and from China. Though it's a novel virus and&#xD;
      little is known about it, the spread was drastic across the world. In fact the spread was so&#xD;
      rapid that by end of February 2020, the number of new cases outside China had leveled up to&#xD;
      13 fold as compared to the number of cases in China. Moreover, the number of infected&#xD;
      countries with COVID-19 tripled. The first two reported cases in Pakistan were from Karachi&#xD;
      and Islamabad on 27 February 2020. These two cases presented with a recent travel history&#xD;
      from Iran. The current statistics showed the confirmed cases in Pakistan reached upto 284,121&#xD;
      till 9 August 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the lockdown period most of the public hospitals and trust closed their Outpatient&#xD;
      departments and started to deal with emergency cases only. However even in such situation&#xD;
      there are some trust hospitals worth mentioning who never closed their services and worked&#xD;
      day and night to entertain their patients by observing all the precautions and safety&#xD;
      measures. Ghurki trust teaching hospital is one of them. This hospital adopted a SMART&#xD;
      STRATEGY or SMART hospital lockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 19th March 2020 till 13th July 2020, the period of lockdown, two thousand one hundred&#xD;
      and sixty surgeries were performed by the orthopaedic team of Ghurki hospital. The breakup of&#xD;
      surgeries during lockdown was as follows: 1514 cases of trauma, 173 procedures of spine, 51&#xD;
      for arthroplasty, 51 for arthroscopy, 21 for tumors and 350 miscellaneous. The team was&#xD;
      available 24 hours, 7 days a week under the supervisor of Professor Amer Aziz, to play their&#xD;
      part in these terrible circumstances.&#xD;

      After the frightful outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China and its evidence of being&#xD;
      contagious, governments around the world particularly United States in an effort to stop the&#xD;
      transmission- imposed travel restrictions to and from China. Though it's a novel virus and&#xD;
      little is known about it, the spread was drastic across the world. In fact the spread was so&#xD;
      rapid that by end of February 2020, the number of new cases outside China had levelled up to&#xD;
      13 fold as compared to the number of cases in China. Moreover, the number of infected&#xD;
      countries with COVID-19 tripled. The first two reported cases in Pakistan were from Karachi&#xD;
      and Islamabad on 27 February 2020. These two cases presented with a recent travel history&#xD;
      from Iran. The current statistics showed the confirmed cases in Pakistan reached upto 284,121&#xD;
      till 9 August 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the Pakistan's government response to COVID-19, quick steps were taken to curtail&#xD;
      the transmission of virus as China is in northeast of Pakistan and also shares its borders&#xD;
      with Iran where the number of cases are increasing exceptionally. As an initial response&#xD;
      Pakistan closed its borders with China and implies strict methods at the Pakistan-Iran&#xD;
      border. Still, in the initial days of pandemic Pakistan lacked the diagnosis kits and relied&#xD;
      on China and Japan for testing purpose. However, later Pakistan was able to receive kits and&#xD;
      started testing samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakistan's federal government along with the Ministry of Health (Moh) initiated a plan known&#xD;
      as &quot;National Action Plan for Corona Virus Disease Pakistan&quot;. The basic motive behind&#xD;
      developing this plan was to generate policies and methods to combat with the deadly virus&#xD;
      across Pakistan. MoH managed to deliver crucial supplies like masks, gloves and suits to the&#xD;
      doctors and paramedical staffs working at frontlines. A state of confusion existed at&#xD;
      different levels in health care system in Pakistan, particularly in Orthopaedic departments&#xD;
      of hospital where elective and emergency services were severely affected during the lockdown&#xD;
      period that started from 19 March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopaedic and Spine Center Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital Lahore:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the lockdown period most of the public hospitals and trust closed their Outpatient&#xD;
      departments and started to deal with emergency cases only. Even the private hospitals were&#xD;
      reluctant to perform elective and emergency orthopaedic procedures. This attitude was may be&#xD;
      due to the information published from other countries on the post operative complications and&#xD;
      reduction of orthopaedic procedures during the period. The closure of orthopaedic health&#xD;
      services brings a great shock to poor people for whom trusts and foundations is the last hope&#xD;
      as they cannot afford the private setups for their health care facilities. However even in&#xD;
      such situation there are some trust hospitals worth mentioning who never closed their&#xD;
      services and worked day and night to entertain their patients by observing all the&#xD;
      precautions and safety measures. Ghurki trust teaching hospital is one of them. This hospital&#xD;
      adopted a SMART STRATEGY or SMART hospital lockdown. The orthopaedic department divided the&#xD;
      members into five teams performing a 1:5 rotations. Each team comprised of one professor, one&#xD;
      assistant professor, one senior registrar and ten trainee residents. Similarly the other&#xD;
      departments like anesthesia, paramedics, nurses and physiotherapists were also subdivided.&#xD;
      Out of two hundred staff, thirty were tested positive for COVID-19 but they all were managed&#xD;
      and returned to normal after home quarantine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgeries during COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 19th March 2020 till 13th July 2020, the period of lockdown, two thousand one hundred&#xD;
      and sixty surgeries were performed by the orthopaedic team of Ghurki hospital. The breakup of&#xD;
      surgeries during lockdown was as follows: 1514 cases of trauma, 173 procedures of spine, 51&#xD;
      for arthroplasty, 51 for arthroscopy, 21 for tumors and 350 miscellaneous. The team was&#xD;
      available 24 hours, 7 days a week under the supervisor of Professor Amer Aziz, to play their&#xD;
      part in these terrible circumstances. The team started their day with recitation of Quranic&#xD;
      prayer which is translated as &quot;In the name of Allah by whose name harm cannot be done by&#xD;
      anything in the earth or in heavens. He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing&quot; (Tirmidhi, Hadith: 3388).&#xD;
      The smart approach utilized was that the patients were operated as soon as possible&#xD;
      preferably within first twenty four hours and discharged them early also one to two days post&#xD;
      op in most cases with complete education. All the patients were screened for COVID but&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) and Pulmonary High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)&#xD;
      was not done in all the patients unless if they presented with suspicious history.&#xD;
      Fortunately, none of the patient tested positive pre operatively. Strict asepsis was observed&#xD;
      during the period.&#xD;
