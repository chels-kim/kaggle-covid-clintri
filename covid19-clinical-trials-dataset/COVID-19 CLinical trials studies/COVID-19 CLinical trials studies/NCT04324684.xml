  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that nearly half of the patients who are hospitalized for Covid-19&#xD;
      pneumonia have on admission old age or comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, hypertension was present in 30% of the cases, diabetes in 19%, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease in 8% and chronic obstructive lung disease in 3% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amazingly, in the two major studies published in the Lancet (Zhou F et al Lancet 2020) and in&#xD;
      the New England Journal of Medicine (Guan W et al 2020), the weight of the subjects as well&#xD;
      their body mass index (BMI) were omitted. However, obesity, alone or in association with&#xD;
      diabetes, can be a major predisposition factor for Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of our prospective, observational study is to assess the recovery rate&#xD;
      in patients with diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. Among the other secondary end-points, we&#xD;
      intend to find the predictors of the time to clinical improvement or hospital discharge in&#xD;
      patients affected by Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;

      It has been reported that nearly half of the patients who are hospitalized for Covid-19&#xD;
      pneumonia have on admission old age or comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, hypertension was present in 30% of the cases, diabetes in 19%, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease in 8% and chronic obstructive lung disease in 3% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amazingly, in the two major studies published in the Lancet and in the New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine, the weight of the subjects as well their body mass index (BMI) were omitted.&#xD;
      However, obesity, alone or in association with diabetes, can be a major predisposition factor&#xD;
      for Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with a systemic low-grade inflammation state with increase circulating&#xD;
      levels on many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belonging to the innate immune system but sharing characteristics with the adaptive immunity,&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells are activated in the white adipose tissue of subjects with obesity&#xD;
      where they proliferate and trigger M1 macrophage accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK cells are the first line of defense against viral infections. They mediate cytolysis or&#xD;
      apoptosis of virus-infected cells. Moreover, NK cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines with&#xD;
      antiviral activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only NK cells frequency is reduced in subjects with obesity but also their cytotoxic&#xD;
      capabilities are reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lower NK cell activity is also present in subjects with type 2 diabetes .Therefore,&#xD;
      subjects with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes should have an enhanced susceptibility to viral&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that hypertension is associated with Covid19 infection in 24-30% of the&#xD;
      cases while diabetes was present in 12% to 22% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now recognized that lipids perform numerous indispensable cellular functions and some&#xD;
      of them are involved in the activation of the immune active cells. In addition, lipids are&#xD;
      involved in multiple steps in the virus replication cycle, and a recent article showed how&#xD;
      metabolic remodelling of host lipids is significantly associated with the propagation of the&#xD;
      human-pathogenic coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipids show both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities and interact with the&#xD;
      immune response through the activation of lipid-reactive T cells. Ceramides (Cer),&#xD;
      phospholipid or sphingolipid, but also amino acids and free fatty acids (FFA), activate the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory pathways resulting in the activation of toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and&#xD;
      Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) that play a role in cell proliferation and activation of&#xD;
      T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platelet-activating factor, (also known as PAF, PAF-acether or AGEPC, i.e.&#xD;
      acetyl-glyceryl-ether-phosphorylcholine), can also be involved. PAF is a potent phospholipid&#xD;
      activator and mediator of many leukocyte functions, platelet aggregation and degranulation,&#xD;
      inflammation, and anaphylaxis. Moreover, it is an important mediator of bronchoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that several lipids may serve as biomarkers of patients who will develop a&#xD;
      more severe reaction to the virus. Measurement of plasma lipidomic profile will help in&#xD;
      finding subjects more at risk to severe pulmonary disease and in helping to target treatment&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of our prospective, observational study is to assess the recovery rate&#xD;
      in patients with diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. Among the other secondary end-points, we&#xD;
      intend to find the predictors of the time to clinical improvement or hospital discharge in&#xD;
      patients affected by Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical improvement is defined as the reduction in severity of Covid-19 pneumonia expressed&#xD;
      as the transition from a higher severity to a less severity condition. The possible outcomes&#xD;
      are 1. Death; 2. hospitalization, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and/or&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation; 3. hospitalization, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy&#xD;
      and/or noninvasive mechanical ventilation; 4. hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen;&#xD;
      5. hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include liver, kidney or multiorgan failure, cardiac failure, the&#xD;
      efficacy of different pharmaceutical treatment against Covid-19 and the development of&#xD;
      predictors and biomarkers of the severity of Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Before starting the study, the protocol will be submitted to and approved by the&#xD;
      local Ethical Committees at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS,&#xD;
      Catholic University, Rome, Italy. Before enrollment each subject will sign the informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: hospitalized subjects of both sexes aged 18 years or older with diagnosis&#xD;
      of pneumonia, confirmed by chest imaging and oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≤ 94% in ambient air,&#xD;
      Covid-19 test positive, given informed consent to data collection from the patient or from&#xD;
      the patient's legal representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: age lower than 18 years, pregnancy or breast-feeding. Nasopharyngeal swab&#xD;
      samples will be taken for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to make diagnosis&#xD;
      of Covid19 (2 repeated tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected include time of symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, diarrhea,&#xD;
      asthenia, arthralgia) age, sex, height, weight, education, alcohol and smoking habits,&#xD;
      morbidities, plasma glucose, creatinine, transaminases, γ-GT, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, complete blood count, D-dimer, lactic acid dehydrogenase&#xD;
      (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinkinase (CK), ferritin, albumin,&#xD;
      HbA1c, chest X rays, chest CT scan, therapy for pneumonia, other treatments including&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive and anti-hyperglycemic agents, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen&#xD;
      flow rate or other types of oxygen treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five ml of plasma divided in aliquots of 1 ml each will be also obtained and stored at -80°C&#xD;
      in anonymized way for future analysis, including third parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point The primary end-point of the study is to compare the mean recovery rate in&#xD;
      patients with diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia, who present with complications at the time of&#xD;
      hospital admission (such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension or&#xD;
      respiratory failure), with the mean recovery rate in patients without any of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary end-point of the study is the comparison of the survival curves (times to&#xD;
      improvement) in the two groups (patients with and without complications) and among patients&#xD;
      presenting with different types of complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obesity and/or type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Chronic obstructive lung disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. None of the above diseases Other endpoints are liver, kidney or multiorgan failure,&#xD;
           cardiac failure, the efficacy of different pharmaceutical treatment against Covid-19 and&#xD;
           the development of predictors and biomarkers of the severity of Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size computation (20) is performed under the following hypotheses: the&#xD;
      rate of recovery for patients without complications is supposed to be 98%; the average rate&#xD;
      of recovery for patients with one of the following complications: diabetes, obesity,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension or chronic respiratory failure, is supposed to be 88%.&#xD;
      Moreover, it is supposed that the ratio between the sizes of the two groups is k=Nc/Nwc = 1,&#xD;
      under the assumption that 50% of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia have one of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned complications. We are, in fact, including overweight and obesity. To reach a&#xD;
      power of 0.80, with a ratio k of 1, the probabilities of improvement equal to pc = 0.88 and&#xD;
      pwc =0.98 and with an expected difference rates of 0.10, the sample size required is 198&#xD;
      patients if α is equal to 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The association between recovery and patient groups will be tested by means of a&#xD;
      Fisher exact test. A Cox Proportional-Hazard regression will be used to compare survival&#xD;
      curves (times to improvement) among the studied groups by correcting for the administered&#xD;
      therapy and for all the quantitative collected variables. Quantitative variables, measured at&#xD;
      hospital admission, will be compared among groups using ANOVA. In univariable analyses,&#xD;
      categorical variables, as gender, education, alcohol consumption and smoke habits will be&#xD;
      analysed by means of a Chi-Squared test to study their association with the recovery, while a&#xD;
      logistic regression model will be used to test possible quantitative predictors of recovery.&#xD;
      A multivariable logistic model, with a stepwise selection procedure, will be then used to&#xD;
      test all the variables that are significant in a univariable analysis.&#xD;
