  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the tissues surrounding the teeth&#xD;
      and is one of the leading causes of tooth loss. Sanative therapy (ST) is a non-surgical&#xD;
      procedure that allows for removal of bacteria from the deep pockets that form around teeth&#xD;
      and is the frontline treatment for periodontal disease. Post-ST, patients require ongoing&#xD;
      maintenance appointments to maintain their oral health, though whether risk factors for&#xD;
      periodontal disease remain a predictor of periodontal health post-ST has not been&#xD;
      comprehensively investigated. Risk factors to be examined include physical activity,&#xD;
      exercise, sedentary time, flavonoid intake, protein intake, BMI, sex, age, smoking status,&#xD;
      and number of sites with periodontal probing depth (PPD) ≥ 4mm at baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a main cause of tooth loss. Patients with periodontal disease may&#xD;
      receive sanative therapy (ST), a deep cleaning of the teeth that helps prevent the&#xD;
      progression of periodontal disease. Post-ST, maintenance appointments are an important part&#xD;
      of the strategy used to help these patients prevent the progression of periodontal disease&#xD;
      and maintain their periodontal health. Given that numerous chronic diseases, obesity, low&#xD;
      levels of physical activity, being a smoker, poor diet, and older age are all risk factors&#xD;
      for periodontal disease, these factors may also be predictive of worse periodontal health 5&#xD;
      to 10 years post-ST. Many modifiable periodontal risk factors such a physical activity,&#xD;
      exercise, and obesity have not been studied in relation to periodontal outcomes post-ST, and&#xD;
      other factors such as diet, sex and age have not been comprehensively studied. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine, at 5 to 10 years post-ST, if physical activity,&#xD;
      exercise, sedentary time, flavonoid intake, protein intake, BMI, sex, age, smoking status,&#xD;
      and number of sites with periodontal probing depth (PPD) ≥ 4 mm at baseline are significant&#xD;
      predictors of periodontal health. A secondary objective is to determine if lifetime estrogen&#xD;
      exposure impacts periodontal health in women. Periodontal health will be measured using&#xD;
      probing depth, tooth loss, bleeding on probing and plaque index. Established questionnaires&#xD;
      will be used to assess dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Within the&#xD;
      study the investigators will also assess if and how a patient's periodontal health has been&#xD;
      impacted by clinic closures and rescheduling of maintenance appointments that were mandated&#xD;
      by regulatory organizations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators will also&#xD;
      ask questions about changes in diet, physical activity and oral hygiene during COVID-19.&#xD;
