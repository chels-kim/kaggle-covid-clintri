  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for a rapidly spreading pandemic that has&#xD;
      reached 160 countries, infecting over 500,000 individuals and killing more than 24,000&#xD;
      people. SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute and potentially lethal respiratory illness, known as&#xD;
      COVID-19, that is threatening to overwhelm health care systems due to a dramatic surge in&#xD;
      hospitalized and critically ill patients. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have&#xD;
      been symptomatic for 5-7 days prior to admission, indicating that there is a window during&#xD;
      which an effective intervention could significantly alter the course of illness, lessen&#xD;
      disease spread, and alleviate the stress on hospital resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no known treatment for COVID-19, though in vitro and one poorly controlled study&#xD;
      have identified a potential antiviral activity for HCQ. The rationale for this clinical trial&#xD;
      is to measure the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for reducing viral load and&#xD;
      shedding in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background COVID-19 is pandemic with high mortality among hospitalized patients despite a&#xD;
      benign course in the large majority of patients infected. Limited data are available from&#xD;
      small outpatient studies and have not shown efficacy in preventing hospitalization.&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have antiviral and immune-modulating effects, but&#xD;
      there are no data concerning their efficacy in reducing viral load and shedding in&#xD;
      outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence supporting possible efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. In cell models, chloroquine&#xD;
      both interferes with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (the cell surface receptor&#xD;
      by which SARS-CoV2 enters human cells) and increases endosomal pH, which interferes (at least&#xD;
      in vitro) with a crucial step in viral replication.1,2 HCQ is 5x more potent than chloroquine&#xD;
      in a Vero cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In independent experiments, chloroquine has&#xD;
      confirmed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, HCQ has in vitro efficacy&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-1. According to news releases, an as-yet-unpublished set of case series in&#xD;
      China (N reportedly 120) suggests the possibility of rapid viral clearance and low rates of&#xD;
      progression to critical illness. In addition to in vitro anti-viral effects chloroquine and&#xD;
      HCQ appear to have immune-modulatory effects, especially via suppression of release of TNF&#xD;
      and IL6, especially in macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence against efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine and HCQ have been promoted as&#xD;
      extremely broad anti-infective agents for decades. The reported effects include suppression&#xD;
      of fungi, atypical bacteria, and viruses. Other than the effects on ACE2 glycosylation, the&#xD;
      mechanisms invoked as evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 have also been invoked for a&#xD;
      wide range of viruses. However, when chloroquine and HCQ have been studied in humans, neither&#xD;
      agent has demonstrated consistent efficacy in clinical trials, including in HIV, influenza,&#xD;
      hepatitis, and Dengue. In one trial, chloroquine resulted in increased viral replication in&#xD;
      Chikungunya virus [Roques et al, Viruses 2018 May 17;10(5)] while in another&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased HIV viral load [Paton et al, JAMA 2012 Jul&#xD;
      25;308(4):353]. Expert opinion advises against HCQ for MERS, another serious coronavirus. An&#xD;
      underpowered (n=30) study of HCQ in COVID-19 recently published in China did not demonstrate&#xD;
      any clinical benefit [Chen et al, J Zhejiang University, 2020 March 9]. The long history of&#xD;
      clinical failure despite in vitro anti-viral activity suggests a low probability of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Trial There is significant publicity concerning the potential use of HCQ in&#xD;
      this pandemic, and many patients are seeking access to this unproven therapy. The ANZICS&#xD;
      guidelines emphasize that novel treatments should be administered within clinical trials; the&#xD;
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (http://bit.ly/SSCCOVID-19) also affirm the lack of&#xD;
      evidence to support the clinical use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. WHO guidance&#xD;
      (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331446/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pd&#xD;
      f) also strongly affirms that &quot;investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics should be done&#xD;
      under ethically approved, randomized, controlled trials.&quot; The evidence thus strongly favors&#xD;
      equipoise.&#xD;
