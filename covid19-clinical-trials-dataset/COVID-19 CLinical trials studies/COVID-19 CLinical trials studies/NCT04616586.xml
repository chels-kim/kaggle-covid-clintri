  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of siltuximab compared with normal saline in&#xD;
      combination with standard of care (SOC) in selected hospitalized patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      previously treated with corticosteroids or another respiratory virus infection associated&#xD;
      with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, parallel-arm,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial of 1-3 doses of siltuximab 11 mg/kg IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      plus SOC vs. matched-volume normal saline (NS) IV over 1 hour plus SOC in 555 patients with&#xD;
      SARS CoV-2 previously treated with corticosteroids or another respiratory virus infection&#xD;
      with elevated CRP levels who have developed serious respiratory complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be stratified by age (&lt;65, ≥65 years), respiratory virus infection&#xD;
      (confirmed SARS-CoV-2, other), and MIV status (yes, no). Crossover between treatment arms&#xD;
      will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive ARDS SOC following the official American Thoracic Society/European&#xD;
      Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice&#xD;
      guideline13 and/or the World Health Organization's (WHO's) clinical management of severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 disease is suspected (WHO Interim Guidance 202014&#xD;
      or other local guidance). Patients may continue receiving their corticosteroid (up to a&#xD;
      cumulative maximum dexamethasone or equivalent dose of 60 mg [except to treat&#xD;
      treatment-emergent reactions or comorbid conditions]) or antiviral therapy (except&#xD;
      aminoquinoline compounds and convalescent plasma) at the same or lower doses if started at&#xD;
      least 4 days (corticosteroid therapy) or at least 2 days (antiviral therapy) prior to&#xD;
      randomization. Patients randomized to Arm A will additionally receive siltuximab 11 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      administered over 1 hour, while patients randomized to Arm B will additionally receive IV NS&#xD;
      administered over 1 hour, with opportunity to repeat their assigned study treatment once or&#xD;
      twice at least 2 days apart on or after Day 3 as their clinical condition and/or laboratory&#xD;
      testing dictate.&#xD;

    <masking_description>At all times, randomized study treatment assignment information will be kept confidential and will not be released to the patient, investigator, the study staff (except the pharmacist), or the Sponsor's Study Team until following the conclusion of the study, except as described below.&#xD;
At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on procedures for breaking the blind. Blinding codes should be broken only in emergency situations for reasons of patient safety. If a patient has an AE that may be considered treatment-related, treatment for the AE should be administered as if the patient is receiving siltuximab. Whenever possible, the investigator should contact the Sponsor's Medical Monitor before breaking the blind. When the blind for a patient has been broken, the reason must be fully documented. The patient for whom the blind has been broken will not receive further doses of study treatment.</masking_description>
