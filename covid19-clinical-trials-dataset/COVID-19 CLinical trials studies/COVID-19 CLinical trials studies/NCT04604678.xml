      Study into the effects of daily use of metformin and low-dose naltrexone (LDN) for 4 weeks to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms, disease severity, and recovery time from COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers will treat 40 patients with metformin (1500 mg/day) and LDN (4.5 mg/day) for&#xD;
      4 weeks to reduce symptoms, disease severity, and recovery time from COVID-19. These 40&#xD;
      patients will be compared with 40 control patients who will receive regular care. All&#xD;
      patients will be asked to complete surveys at baseline and after 1, 2, and 4 weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment. The difference with baseline at each time point will be assessed.&#xD;
      The surveys will assess COVID-19 symptoms severity.&#xD;
