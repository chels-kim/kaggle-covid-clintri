  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to identify socio-demographic factors, behaviors and practices&#xD;
      associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2 to help determine where and how patients mostly get&#xD;
      infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a case-control study including :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases identified by the nationwide system of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (COVID-19&#xD;
           diagnosis information system, SIDEP) (currently limited to qRT-PCR) and invited to&#xD;
           participate by the National Health Insurance (CNAM) which hosts the data from the&#xD;
           nationwide test system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  controls included via Ipsos, a polling institute with access to personal data from a&#xD;
           panel from which they will include controls matched on age (divided into 10-year&#xD;
           categories), gender and geographic area (departement);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases will be offered to invite a person they live with to participate in the study&#xD;
           offering another case-control analysis inside a household. These participants will be&#xD;
           required to report the result of the test as recommended by contact tracing guidelines&#xD;
           to determine whether they are cases or controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via a self-administered online questionnaire. Some of the participants&#xD;
      will be called for a complementary telephone questionnaire to measure reliability of online&#xD;
      retrieved data and explore more specific aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to identify socio-demographic factors, behaviors and practices&#xD;
      associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2 to help determine where and how patients mostly get&#xD;
      infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will focus on sociodemographic data (age, gender, location of residence,&#xD;
      socio-economic level, etc.), behaviors and practices (adherence to hand-washing,&#xD;
      mask-wearing, work habits, meetings, etc.), the places they visit (public transportation,&#xD;
      bars, restaurants, sport facilities, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a case-control study including :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases identified by the nationwide system of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (SIDEP)&#xD;
           (currently limited to RT-PCR) and invited to participate by CNAM, which hosts the data&#xD;
           from the nationwide test system, through a nationwide email campaign sent once a week;&#xD;
           cases will be asked if they can tell where they most probably were infected, leading to&#xD;
           a detailed description of the circumstances of the contamination, including whether the&#xD;
           suspected contamination took place within the household or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  controls included via Ipsos, a polling institute with access to personal data from a&#xD;
           panel from which they will include controls matched on age (divided into 10-year&#xD;
           categories up to 68 years old included as expected adherence to an online questionnaire&#xD;
           quickly drops beyond that age), gender and geographic area (departement); invitations&#xD;
           will be sent every week via email to adapt the profile of recruited controls to the age,&#xD;
           gender and geographic profiles of the cases that participated in the previous week;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases will be offered to invite a person they live with to participate in the study&#xD;
           offering another case-control analysis inside a household. Cases will be recommended not&#xD;
           to invite the person that they suspect was responsible for their contamination, if a&#xD;
           intra-household contamination is suspected. They will indicate the email address of that&#xD;
           person to allow sending of an invitation via email. These participants will be required&#xD;
           to report the result of the test as recommended by contact tracing guidelines to&#xD;
           determine whether they are cases or controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will also include descriptive analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of the proportion of cases infected within the household or outside&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among the cases with a extra-household contamination suspicion, proportion of cases for&#xD;
           whom infection circumstances are known and description of these circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of cases for whom no specific circumstance of contamination could be&#xD;
           evidenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will focus on the 10 days preceding :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptom onset (symptomatic cases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  day of testing (asymptomatic cases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  day of symptom onset of the first case within a household (people from the same&#xD;
           household as cases) or testing of the first case if they are asymptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  questionnaire completion (Ipsos-recruited controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered at the end of the online self-administered questionnaire to&#xD;
      indicate a phone number. Among those agreeing to do so, a random sample of case-control pairs&#xD;
      and cases of particular interest (eg with specific contamination circumstances) will be&#xD;
      called within two weeks following the online questionnaire for a more detailed telephone&#xD;
      questionnaire to measure reliability of online retrieved data and explore more specific&#xD;
      aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.&#xD;
