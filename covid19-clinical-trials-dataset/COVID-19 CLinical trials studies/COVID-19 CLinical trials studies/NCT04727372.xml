  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social settings of Pakistan is unique in the sense that it is composed of multilingual,&#xD;
      multicultural and different ethnicities. Also their believes and faiths are so unpredictable.&#xD;
      It is therefore observed that this social phenomenon affects the acceptability of new things&#xD;
      in this area. Polio vaccination has not worked so well in the past. Iodized salt&#xD;
      acceptability has also been criticized in the last decades and is a matter of controversy&#xD;
      till now. This behavior has also developed before the commencement of vaccination of COVID-19&#xD;
      in Pakistan, as there are many rumors and fears circulating via social media amongst&#xD;
      Pakistan. What will be the acceptance rate for this vaccination, the time will decide.&#xD;
