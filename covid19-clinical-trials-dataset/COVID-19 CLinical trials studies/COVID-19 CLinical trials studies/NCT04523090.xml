    <textblock>
      COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rapidly escalating global pandemic for which there&#xD;
      is no proven effective treatment. COVID-19 is multi-dimensional disease caused by viral&#xD;
      cytopathic effects and host-mediated immunopathology. Therapeutic approaches should logically&#xD;
      be based on interventions that have direct anti-viral effects and favourably modulate the&#xD;
      host immune response. Thus, an optimal drug regimen in ambulatory patients should&#xD;
      collectively (i) target and reduce viral replication, (ii) upregulate host innate immune&#xD;
      anti-viral responses, (iii) have favourable immunomodulatory properties, and (iv) minimise&#xD;
      disease progression to hospitalisation thus circumventing the 'cytokine storm' that likely&#xD;
      underpins ARDS and multi-organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an antiprotozoal drug that is FDA-approved for treating Cryptosporidium&#xD;
      and Giardia and has an excellent safety record for a variety of indications, but primarily as&#xD;
      an anti-parasitic agent. It has proven broad anti-viral activity as it amplifies cytoplasmic&#xD;
      RNA sensing, potently augments type I interferon and autophagy-mediated anti-viral responses,&#xD;
      has immunomodulatory properties e.g inhibits macrophage IL-6 production, and interferes with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 glycosylation. It has been shown to have anti-viral activity against several&#xD;
      viruses including Ebola, influenza, hepatitis B and C, rotavirus and norovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to respiratory viral infections, NTZ was evaluated in uncomplicated influenza and&#xD;
      demonstrated a reduction in the median time to symptom recovery. By contrast, NTZ failed to&#xD;
      show benefit in hospitalised patients with severe influenza suggesting that, as with&#xD;
      oseltamivir (Tamiflu), it likely needs to be administered early in the course of the disease.&#xD;
      NTZ has proven in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. NTZ inhibited the SARs-CoV-2 at a&#xD;
      low-micromolar concentrations and in vivo evaluation in patients with COVID-19 has been&#xD;
      strongly recommended. NTZ has an excellent drug-drug interaction profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinically significant interactions are expected with commonly used antihypertensive&#xD;
      agents, antidiabetics drugs, antiretroviral agents, steroids or commonly prescribed&#xD;
      analgesics / anti-inflammatory agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose NTZ for the treatment of mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients&#xD;
      with HIV co-infection and/or enhanced risk for progression to severe disease (age &gt; 50 years&#xD;
      and/ or with comorbidity). The investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      enrolling 960 patients with mild disease. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion&#xD;
      progressing to severe disease (hospitalisation) based on the WHO clinical progression scale&#xD;
      (progression to stage 4 and beyond). Secondary outcome measures will include disease rates in&#xD;
      contacts and effect on viral load, productive infectiousness using viral cultures, and&#xD;
      ability to abrogate the generation of infectious aerosols using novel cough aerosol sampling&#xD;
      technology. Recruitment is stratified and thus the study is powered to detect progression to&#xD;
      severe disease in HIV-infected persons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rapidly escalating global pandemic(9).&#xD;
      The pandemic is on an upward and escalating trajectory in most countries though some&#xD;
      countries like China have shown a substantial decrease in the number of new cases being&#xD;
      recorded. It is unclear if there will be a second wave of the epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most cases of COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms (~80%) and act as&#xD;
      carriers for disease transmission. Recent longitudinal studies indicate that the SARS-COV-2&#xD;
      viral load in the pharynx is highest during the prodromal phase of COVID-19. Thus, early&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention, prior to respiratory tract dissemination and disease amplification,&#xD;
      is likely to be a promising strategy. Although such persons are advised to be in self&#xD;
      isolation, many, especially in resource-poor settings (due to several factors including&#xD;
      poverty, overcrowding, environmental conditions, personal beliefs, stigma and human&#xD;
      fallibility), continue to have contact with others thus fuelling the epidemic. Therefore,&#xD;
      reducing the period of infectiousness in ambulatory patients will have major public health&#xD;
      impact by shortening the epidemic, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retarding the progression of the 15 to 20% that will develop more severe disease will have&#xD;
      benefits for the public health system, which is struggling to cope with a surge in cases and&#xD;
      will thus have a likely impact on mortality. Thus, therapeutic agents that can reduce viral&#xD;
      load, viral shedding, the duration of illness and progression to severe disease are urgently&#xD;
      needed. It is important to note that HIV-infected persons and certain sub-groups (including&#xD;
      those &gt; 50 years of age, and with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension etc.) may have&#xD;
      'enhanced risk' of disease progression. Collectively such persons would constitute an&#xD;
      enhanced risk group and are at the highest risk of disease progression. The risk of disease&#xD;
      progression in HIV-infected persons and whether they will respond to the NTZ intervention to&#xD;
      the same extent as HIV uninfected persons remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTZ is licensed in the USA for treatment of diarrhoea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and&#xD;
      Giardia lamblia. NTZ is a pro-drug for tizoxanide, which also has broad spectrum antiviral&#xD;
      properties, has many viral indications and shows promising pharmacodynamics against&#xD;
      Coronaviridae. NTZ was identified as a first-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drug and has&#xD;
      been repurposed for the treatment of influenza. In vitro studies evaluating tizoxanide, the&#xD;
      active circulating metabolite of NTZ, inhibits the replication of broad range of influenza A&#xD;
      and B, HIN1, H3N2, H3N2V, H3N8, H5N9, H7N1 and oseltamivir resistant strain and coronaviruses&#xD;
      see (table 1 below) (13-17). It has been shown to have anti-viral activity against several&#xD;
      viruses including Ebola, hepatitis B and C, rotavirus and norovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that&#xD;
      oral administration of NTZ slow release formulation 600 mg twice daily for five days reduced&#xD;
      the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons&#xD;
      with laboratory-confirmed influenza. These dosages are suitable for treating viral&#xD;
      respiratory infections caused by influenza and other viruses as in vitro IC50s are typically&#xD;
      between 0.1 and 1ug/mL. The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with&#xD;
      influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of tizoxanide is attributed to interference with host&#xD;
      regulated pathways involved in viral replication. These pathways include IFN and mTOR1&#xD;
      (autophagy) signalling pathways. NTZ upregulates the innate anti-viral mechanisms by broadly&#xD;
      amplifying cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways. It is also a potent driver of&#xD;
      autophagy, an antiviral and anti-bacterial mechanism. Thus, NTZ interferes with the viral&#xD;
      infection by upregulating the precise host mechanisms that viruses target to bypass host&#xD;
      cellular defences. Additionally, NTZ inhibits replication of a broad range of influenza&#xD;
      viruses, including neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strains by blocking the maturation of&#xD;
      viral haemagglutinin at the posttranslational level. NTZ impairs intracellular trafficking&#xD;
      and insertion of viral haemagglutinin into the host plasma membrane. In cell culture studies,&#xD;
      NTZ acts synergistically with neuraminidase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTZ may inhibit the glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2, similar to its action on the&#xD;
      hemagglutinin antigen of the influenza virus. Additionally, NTZ also exhibits inhibitory&#xD;
      activity against IL-6 production from murine macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover,&#xD;
      there is a good possibility that diseases associated with IL-6 overproduction (cytokine&#xD;
      storm) like SARS-CoV-2 could be ameliorated by NTZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTZ may be useful for the early treatment of COVID-19 when viral load is at its highest in&#xD;
      the pharynx; and could serve to limit viral shedding thus significantly reducing disease&#xD;
      transmission. In the same group it may retard progression to severe disease. Although only 15&#xD;
      to 20% of patients with COVID-19 may develop severe disease, large numbers of such patients&#xD;
      will totally overwhelm healthcare systems as currently being experienced in the USA and the&#xD;
      Western Cape province of South Africa. Thus, whether NTZ is useful in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate COVID-19 disease remains unclarified and urgently needs to be addressed.&#xD;
      Unreliability with using duration of illness (pre-symptomatic period is variable and symptom&#xD;
      onset is subject to substantial recall bias) and viral load (may be different in different&#xD;
      anatomical locations and will depend on tolerance and host immunity) as proxy measures means&#xD;
      that the investigators have to embark on a phase IIB/III study to determine whether NTZ&#xD;
      effects a clinically meaningful outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A single-stage, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of nitazoxanide (NTZ) in reducing the progression&#xD;
      from mild to severe COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and impact: The investigators will perform a randomised placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      recruiting 960 mildly symptomatic non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients at 7 sites from 4 cities&#xD;
      in South Africa. The primary outcome measure will be time-specific (30- and 60-day) disease&#xD;
      severity based on the WHO clinical progression scale. This will have implications for disease&#xD;
      transmission and amplification of the epidemic. The rate of progression to severe disease&#xD;
      will determine hospitalisation rates, morbidity, and mortality. It will also have&#xD;
      implications for reducing healthcare burden, costs and improving healthcare worker safety.&#xD;
      The investigators predict that the progression to severe disease (need for presentation or&#xD;
      admission to hospital) will be reduced with NTZ. As disease progression will more likely&#xD;
      occur in those who are HIV-infected or with enhanced risk (older patients or those with&#xD;
      immunosuppression), the investigators will stratify randomisation for HIV-infected and&#xD;
      enhanced risk patients (described in detail later).&#xD;
