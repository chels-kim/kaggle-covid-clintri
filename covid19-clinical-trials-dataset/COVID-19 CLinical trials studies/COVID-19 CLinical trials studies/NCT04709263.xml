  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter non-interventional observational prospective registry. This&#xD;
      non-interventional study (NIS) does not imply any intervention into a routine clinical&#xD;
      practice, including choice of treatment modality or special methods of investigation. The&#xD;
      study will include only those patients who sign the informed consent form (ICF) after&#xD;
      explanation of the study objectives and methods by the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned study population consists of 20 000 adult outpatients with HF. All patients with HF&#xD;
      who signed an ICF will be included to this study. Planned number of study sites is 150&#xD;
      outpatient centers in about 50 regions (in order to describe characteristics of outpatients&#xD;
      with HF in different regions in the most comprehensive way).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected inclusion period duration - 24 months OR reaching 20 000 patients, if this takes&#xD;
      less than 24 months. Planned follow-up period duration for 1 patient is about 52 weeks (12&#xD;
      months), which includes 3 visits (visit 1 - inclusion; visit 2 - approximately 6 months after&#xD;
      inclusion; visit 3 - approximately 12 months after inclusion).&#xD;

        This non-interventional multicenter observational study will include 20,000 adult&#xD;
        outpatients with HF who are monitored and treated by cardiologists or internal medicine&#xD;
        specialists. In the study, patients will be followed up for about 12 months after being&#xD;
        included in approximately 150 clinical centers in Russia. This NIS does not imply any&#xD;
        intervention in routine clinical practice, including choice of treatment modality or&#xD;
        special methods of investigation. It is planned to include all patients with CHF, who gave&#xD;
        their informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
