  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Extravascular Lung Water Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>EVLWI is calculated as ml of extravascular lung water fluid reported by VolumeView system (Edwards Lifesciences) divided by patient's body weight in kg. EVLWI will be measured at baseline and 1 hour post T3 installation to calculate change in EVLWI. Lower EVLWI values indicate greater treatment efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of ICU Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to ICU discharge up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the mean length of stay (in days) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for participants in each arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Ventilator-Free Days</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the mean number of days participants in each arm did not require mechanical ventilation during an in-patient hospital admission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-day Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the number of participants in each arm who are alive 30-days post enrollment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Creatinine Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the number of participants in each arm with abnormally high plasma creatinine concentration (greater 1.21 milligrams per deciliter).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glomerular Filtration Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the number of participants in each arm with impaired kidney function, defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the number of participants in each arm who fall into each of 4 categories: 1 (no limitation in normal physical activity), 2 (mild symptoms only in normal activity), 3 (marked symptoms during daily activities, asymptomatic only at rest), and 4 (severe limitations, symptoms even at rest).</description>

    <description>The first dose of T3 (50 micrograms in 10 mls volume BID) will be instilled by an investigator or under their direct supervision within 48 hours of obtaining consent after verifying that the patient is not too unstable to treat at that time. T3 doses will be given in 50 mcg doses twice daily for 4 days.</description>
