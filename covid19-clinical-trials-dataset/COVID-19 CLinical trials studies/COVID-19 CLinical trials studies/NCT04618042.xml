  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular leakage following endothelial injury, responsible for interstitial and alveolar&#xD;
      edema, is a major feature of pathogen induced acute lung injury. As acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pandemic Covid-19 is associated with more than 60% mortality,&#xD;
      controlling vascular leakage may be a major target to decrease the mortality associated with&#xD;
      the spreading of the disease in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FX06, a drug under clinical development containing fibrin-derived peptide beta15-42, is able&#xD;
      to stabilize cell-cell interactions, thereby reducing vascular leak and mortality in several&#xD;
      animal models, particularly during lipopolysaccharide-induced and dengue hemorrhagic shock .&#xD;
      A phase I study was conducted in humans, with no specific adverse event detected with a dose&#xD;
      up to 17.5 mg/kg. In a phase II randomized multicentre double-blinded trial in 234 patients&#xD;
      suffering from ST+ acute coronary syndrome, FX06 treated patients exhibited a 58% decrease in&#xD;
      the early necrotic core zone. Importantly, adverse events were highly comparable between&#xD;
      groups, indicating a high safety profile for the drug . Lastly, the drug was used as a&#xD;
      salvage therapy in a patient exhibiting a severe ARDS following EBOLA virus infection .&#xD;
      Altogether, those data indicate that FX06 is well tolerated in humans and is a potent&#xD;
      regulator of vascular leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis here is that FX06 may decrease pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability during&#xD;
      ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby improving gas exchanges and the outcome of&#xD;
      infected patients.&#xD;

    <description>A test for immunogenicity will be performed on a serum sample at day 7 (2 days after the end of treatment administration) to detect any antibody against FX06. The assay will consist in a three-fold procedure, as recommended by the manufacturer. An initial screening assay will qualitatively measure antibodies to FX06. Samples deemed positive will be subject to a confirmatory assay, which will determine the specificity of the detected antibody against FX06. The third tier of the assay will consist in titre analysis to semi-quantitatively assess the antibody response.</description>
