  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVIDTrach aims to assess the outcomes of tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19. The use of personal protective equipment and incidence of COVID-19 amongst&#xD;
      operators is also recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 can lead to a severe respiratory illness with 5-12% requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.Standard UK intensive care practice is to consider a tracheostomy after 7-10 days&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation in order to facilitate weaning, reduce duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, shorten intensive care stay and reduce complications relating to prolonged&#xD;
      presence of an endotracheal tube. Given the severity of respiratory illness and a mortality&#xD;
      in mechanically ventilated COVID 19 patients which exceeds 50%, the benefit of tracheostomy&#xD;
      in this group is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also unique considerations regarding health care professional (HCP) safety when&#xD;
      performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients due to the potential of aerosol generation and&#xD;
      transmission of the infection. ENT UK and other organisations have issued guidance regarding&#xD;
      surgical tracheostomy in terms of timing, environment, technique and level of personal&#xD;
      protective equipment (PPE). The ability of hospital departments to follow this guidance and&#xD;
      the effectiveness of these measures is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This UK national cohort study aims to assess the effects of tracheostomy in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated COVID-19 patients in terms of the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of&#xD;
      ICU and hospital stay and mortality. These data will be related to COVID-19 patients who are&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated but do not undergo tracheostomy, as captured by the UK Intensive Care&#xD;
      National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel we will collect data on the tracheostomy procedure itself and compare these to&#xD;
      national guidance on tracheostomy in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and on COVID-19&#xD;
      infections in the surgical and medical teams involved in the tracheostomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal builds upon the ongoing COVIDTrach project that has captured data on 550&#xD;
      COVID-19 tracheostomies from 78 NHS hospitals throughout the UK so far. COVIDTrach has&#xD;
      successfully brought together surgical, intensive care and anaesthetic specialists to capture&#xD;
      early timepoints following tracheostomy. Moving forward, we will work with speech and&#xD;
      language therapists and physiotherapists to capture later stages in the patient pathway. This&#xD;
      will provide a unique and comprehensive assessment of the role of tracheostomy in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. It will lay the foundation for further much needed multidisciplinary research into&#xD;
      the role of tracheostomy in respiratory disease beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
