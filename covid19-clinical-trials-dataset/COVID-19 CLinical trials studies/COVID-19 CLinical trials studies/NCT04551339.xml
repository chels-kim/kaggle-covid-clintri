      The purpose of this research study is to look at high dose zinc versus multivitamin&#xD;
      micronutrient supplementation to support immune health in the setting of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a two-cohort prospective randomized study intended to test the role of Zinc versus&#xD;
      multivitamin supplementation in supporting immune health in the setting of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. Individuals over 50 years old or primary health care professionals over the age of&#xD;
      18 who have had no evidence of prior COVID-19 infection and who have been asymptomatic for 7&#xD;
      days prior to enrollment will be randomized at the individual level to take either&#xD;
      PreserVision AREDS formulation soft gels or tablets with 69.6mg/day Zinc supplementation or&#xD;
      to receive a multivitamin supplement with 11mg of zinc/day.&#xD;
