      To evaluate the performance of the FDA EUA authorized Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit for&#xD;
      the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab samples as compared to a known&#xD;
      high sensitivity EUA RT-PCR among asymptomatic individuals. The comparator assay for this&#xD;
      study is the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit recently received FDA Emergency Use Authorization&#xD;
      (EUA) for prescription home use with self-collected nasal swab samples in individuals aged 14&#xD;
      and older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. The basis for this FDA&#xD;
      EUA authorization was Lucira Health's first Community Testing study (07A-CLI-006) conducted&#xD;
      among individuals suspected of COVID-19. This follow on performance study will be used to&#xD;
      establish the performance of the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit as compared to a known&#xD;
      high sensitivity RT-PCR molecular assay among asymptomatic individuals. The results of this&#xD;
      study will be used to support an expanded indication for the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test&#xD;
      Kit among asymptomatic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This performance study will include the collection of subject demographics and nasal swabs&#xD;
      self-collected by study subjects at community-based locations with trained medical staff&#xD;
      oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining subject eligibility and following the completion of the informed consent&#xD;
      process, each subject will receive a unique study identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject's participation in this study will consist of one study visit with one collection&#xD;
      event. The subject self-collects a nasal swab sample and runs the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One&#xD;
      Test Kit according to the FDA EUA authorized package insert instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will be observed during the swabbing collection by the study staff and study staff&#xD;
      will document collection details and any collection issues. Nasal swabs obtained from&#xD;
      self-collection will be discarded after having been used for testing per the instructions.&#xD;
      Study staff will interpret and share the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit result with&#xD;
      study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit self-collection will be an additional swab&#xD;
      collection for reference method testing. One (1) additional NS specimen will be&#xD;
      self-collected, prepared in Transport Medium and sent to the reference laboratory as directed&#xD;
      by the Study Operations Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each collection may have a maximum of two swabs, including retests, for a maximum of four&#xD;
      swabs per visit.&#xD;

    <description>The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit is intended to detect the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 in nasal swab samples. This test is a single-use test kit that determines whether there is active shedding of the virus which causes COVID-19. This test utilizes a molecular amplification technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.&#xD;
Positive results are indicative of active infection with SARS-CoV-2. Persons who test positive should self-isolate and seek care from their healthcare provider.&#xD;
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persons who continue to experience COVID-like symptoms should seek follow up care from their healthcare provider</description>
