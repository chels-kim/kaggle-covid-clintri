    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, open, parallel-controlled study. Qualified subjects&#xD;
      will randomly be assigned to the experimental arm or the control arm according to the ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1, with age (&gt; 60 years or ≤ 60 years), smoking status (yes/no) and forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume in one second/prediction (FEV1 %pred &gt; 60% or ≤ 60%) as the random stratification&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

      Subjects in the experimental arm and the control arm will receive hydrogen-oxygen mixed gas&#xD;
      inhalation (Hydrogen-Oxygen Generator with Nebulizer, AMS-H-03, output: 3 L/min (hydrogen&#xD;
      concentration: 66.7%, oxygen concentration: 33.3%)) and oxygen inhalation (OLO-1 Medical&#xD;
      Molecular Sieve Oxygen Generator, output: 3 L/min (oxygen concentration: 33.3%), Shanghai&#xD;
      Ouliang Medical Devices Co., Ltd.), respectively; the treatment duration will not be less&#xD;
      than 8 hours per day, for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the experimental arm and the control arm will also receive other medications&#xD;
      (excluding antiviral drugs) by the investigator as clinically indicated. Six visits are&#xD;
      required for each subject in this study, including Visit 1 (D-7~-1), Visit 2 (D1), Visit 3&#xD;
      (D14±3d), Visit 4 (D28±3d), Visit 5 (D56±7d), Visit 6 (D84±7d).&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study is conducted in a double-blind design with a primary unblinding, and a terminal unblinding is performed after data review, database lock, and finalization of the statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
Both the investigational device (AMS-H-03 Hydrogen-Oxygen Generator with Nebulizer) and the control device (OLO-1 Medical Molecular Sieve Oxygen Generator) were placed in the shell with the same appearance, with the same operating interface and only ventilation function. During the treatment, neither the investigator nor the subject would be aware of the treatment allocation The study devices will be masked by independent non-blinded personnel of the statistical company according to the corresponding operating procedures, and no specific personnel participating in the clinical operation shall be present during the process.</masking_description>
