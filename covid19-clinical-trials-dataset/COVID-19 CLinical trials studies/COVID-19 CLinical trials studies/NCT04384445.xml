      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      Intravenous Infusion of Zofin for treatment of moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      (SARS) related to COVID-19 infection vs Placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A human coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak&#xD;
      worldwide. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The&#xD;
      majority of cases result in mild symptoms, but some can progress into pneumonia and&#xD;
      multi-organ failure. According to the severity it is divided into mild, normal, severe and&#xD;
      critically ill, which is associated with ICU admission and mortality. At present, the&#xD;
      standard treatment of COVD-19 patients is oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and&#xD;
      medications to maintain blood pressure. As of today, no specific antiviral therapy is&#xD;
      available for patients with COVID-19. Immune activation in some patients, and the appearance&#xD;
      of cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is one of the important causes of severe damage to lungs and&#xD;
      other organs, which may lead to death. There is an urgent need to develop new interventions&#xD;
      to suppress the excessive immune response in a timely manner during the course of disease,&#xD;
      protect alveolar function, and reduce lung and systemic organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zofin is an acellular, minimally manipulated product, derived from human amniotic fluid&#xD;
      (HAF). This product contains over 300 growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines as well as&#xD;
      other extracellular vesicles/nanoparticles derived from amniotic stem and epithelial cells.&#xD;
      The product contains a mean concentration of 5.24x10^11 particles/mL with a mean mode size of&#xD;
      125.2nm. Surface marker analysis confirmed the presence of exosome associated proteins CD63,&#xD;
      CD81, and CD9 in addition to high expression of CD133. The completed sequencing revealed 102&#xD;
      commonly expressed miRNA (with a 100-copy expression minimum). Bioinformatics analysis linked&#xD;
      63 miRNAs to 1216 RNA targets. Major players in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade found to&#xD;
      be targeted by miRNA were discovered in Organicell's product include TNF, IL-6, and IL-8.&#xD;
      Additionally, a broader array of pro-inflammatory cytokines is also targeted by the&#xD;
      collection of miRNA such as FGF2, IFNB1, IGF1, IL36a, IL37, TGF-B2, VEGFA, CCL8, and CXCL12.&#xD;
      It has been suggested in published research that inhibition or suppression of this&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade may reduce the severity of symptoms associated with&#xD;
      elevated immune response. Furthermore, the miRNA was found to target 148 genes associated&#xD;
      with immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The property of Zofin demonstrates the therapeutic potential as a suppressor of cytokine&#xD;
      activation for the reduction of COVID-19 infection severity. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      safety and potential efficacy of HAF derived acellular product in subjects suffering form&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).&#xD;
