  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our prospective monocentric, randomized, controlled trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of intravenous lidocaine on gas exchange and inflammation in acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) due or not to Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the patients will receive intravenous lidocaine and the other half will receive&#xD;
      intravenous NaCl 0,9 % as placebo.&#xD;
