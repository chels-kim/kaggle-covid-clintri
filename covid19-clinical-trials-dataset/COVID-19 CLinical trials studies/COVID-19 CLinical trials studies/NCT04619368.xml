  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the last years, studies have described the &quot; Post-intensive care Syndrome &quot; (PICS), which&#xD;
      consists in alteration of quality of life, cognition, autonomy and psychological disorders&#xD;
      within the months after intensive-care. Patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units are at&#xD;
      high risks to develop PICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to analyse the incidence of the post-traumatic stress disorder at 12&#xD;
      months after intensive-care for a COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have showed that ARDS survivors keep, even a long time after hospitalization, a&#xD;
      functional respiratory disability, resulting on one hand from impaired diffusion of carbon&#xD;
      monoxide, and on the other hand from a muscular weakness. Indeed, 67% of patients ventilated&#xD;
      more than 10 days have a neuromyopathy whose recovery is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside this, Long-term quality of life is worse than in general population, due in particular&#xD;
      to depressive and anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic syndrome disorder with a&#xD;
      prevalence around 22% after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will consist in phone call with an intensive care doctor. These visits would be&#xD;
      the opportunity to screen the complications after intensive-care with, find solutions to cure&#xD;
      them or decrease their impact on patient's life to improve quality of life and prevent the&#xD;
      post-traumatic syndrome disorder PTSD. A review would be sent to the patients' General&#xD;
      Practitioners at the end of each visit.&#xD;
