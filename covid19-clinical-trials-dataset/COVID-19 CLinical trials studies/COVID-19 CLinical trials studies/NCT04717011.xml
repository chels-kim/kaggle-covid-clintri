      A descriptive, clinical series, single-centre, national, biomedical study to determine the&#xD;
      presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm samples from positive PCR patients for COVID-19 and to&#xD;
      evaluate the presence of the virus in the sperm samples after a negative PCR for COVID-19&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In late December 2019, a new coronavirus strain emerged in China causing coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID19). Since then, COVID19 has become a global pandemic outbreak being declared a&#xD;
      &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot; by the International Health Regulations&#xD;
      Emergency Committee of the WHO on January 30, 2020. The pandemic concerns to public worldwide&#xD;
      but also to couples aiming to conceive through natural means or undergoing assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technologies (ART). Different organizations including the American Society of&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine have recommended a precautionary approach. Therefore, new cycles for&#xD;
      infertility patients as well as non-medically urgent gamete preservation treatments, such as&#xD;
      social egg freezing, have been suspended in many countries. The decision to resume the In&#xD;
      vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment make us to question if virus could be in gametes&#xD;
      affecting couples and reproductive outcomes. The presence of the virus in sperm have&#xD;
      contradictory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to describe if there could be presence of virus in sperm samples of&#xD;
      patients with positive diagnosis for COVID-19, and if so, if the virus turns negative on the&#xD;
      sperm after the patient recovers and have a negative result for COVID-19. Also it aims to&#xD;
      assess the presence of the virus in the seminal plasma and discern if it possible to&#xD;
      disseminate it by sexual transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis is expected to be carried out once the 50% of the expected recruitment is&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;

        The study population will include males diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive PCR with ages&#xD;
        between 18-65. These patients will be recruited from all participant departments of the&#xD;
        hospital and organized by the Quality and/or Occupational Safety department.&#xD;
