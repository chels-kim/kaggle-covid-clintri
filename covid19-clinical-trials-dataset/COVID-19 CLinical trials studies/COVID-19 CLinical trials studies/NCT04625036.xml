  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 coronavirus-induced infection (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic that has spread&#xD;
      worldwide. Up to date, many subjects affected by the virus report important sequelae on&#xD;
      different organs increasing morbidity and exacerbating previous pathological conditions.&#xD;
      Mortality is also increased in cases of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      hypertension and diabetes. COVID-19 infection is caused by Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
      Concerning the specific interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cardiovascular system, we know&#xD;
      that this virus enters the body through the receptors for the conversion of angiotensin II&#xD;
      (ACE2r) that are present in the lungs, heart, intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium.&#xD;
      This receptor's availability suggests a multi-organ involvement with a consequent multi-organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, as found in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, poor vascular peripheral function -usually correlated with old age and long&#xD;
      periods of bed rest or hypomobility- is a distinguishing characteristic of the population&#xD;
      affected by COVID-19, as well. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that peripheral vascular&#xD;
      function, already deteriorated by aging and common age-related diseases, can be further&#xD;
      compromised by COVID-19 and by the forced hypomobility, typically experienced during the&#xD;
      acute phase of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this project will be to investigate the peripheral NO-mediated vascular&#xD;
      function in the leg of patients recovering from Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant vascular dysfunction is expected to be found in post COVID individuals and to&#xD;
      be correlated to the relevant clinical variables.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 2019 coronavirus-induced infection (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic that has spread&#xD;
      worldwide, causing approximately 250,000 deaths to date. Even if the contagion curves seem to&#xD;
      stabilize, many subjects have been affected by the virus and report important sequelae on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. This can be explained by the assumption that COVID-19 interacts with&#xD;
      the cardiovascular system at different levels, increasing morbidity and exacerbating previous&#xD;
      pathological conditions. Mortality is, in fact, increased in cases of comorbidities such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection is caused by Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus enters the body&#xD;
      through the receptor for the conversion of angiotensin [angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,&#xD;
      ACE2]. This receptor is present in the lungs, heart, intestinal epithelium and vascular&#xD;
      endothelium. The receptor's availability suggests a multi-organ dysfunction, as found in&#xD;
      patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the infection of endothelial cells&#xD;
      or pericytes, as well as the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cascade induced by the infection,&#xD;
      can lead to severe microvascular and macrovascular dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to underline that endothelial damage is one of the precursors of the&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction is related to pulmonary, cardiac and neurological&#xD;
      diseases. Furthermore, poor vascular function is related to old age and long periods of bed&#xD;
      rest or hypomobility, those characteristics are present in the population affected by&#xD;
      COVID-19, as well. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that peripheral vascular function,&#xD;
      already deteriorated by aging and common age-related diseases, can be further compromised by&#xD;
      COVID-19 and by the forced hypomobility typically experienced during the acute phase of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the endothelial function mediated by nitric oxide (NO) has been easily and&#xD;
      non-invasively investigated on common femoral artery with the ultrasound technique of Single&#xD;
      Passive Leg Movement. The main aim of this project will be to investigate the NO-mediated&#xD;
      vascular function in patients recovering from Covid-19 pneumonia, within one month from&#xD;
      discharge in order to verify the presence of endothelial dysfunction acutely induced by the&#xD;
      viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim will be to evaluate the correlation between NO-mediated vascular function&#xD;
      (evaluated by ultrasound technique) and age, anthropometric parameters (height, weight, Body&#xD;
      Mass Index), clinical parameters, oxygenation status, physical performance and pharmacology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed with the Shapiro-Wilk test to evaluate their &quot;normality&quot; and will&#xD;
      be presented as mean Â± standard deviation (sd) or median (interquartile range) depending on&#xD;
      the type of distribution detected. Correlation tests (Pearson/Spearman) between ultrasound&#xD;
      evaluation on peripheral blood flow and vessels and oxygenation levels, clinical,&#xD;
      anthropometric and physical performance measures will then be performed. Values of p &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant peripheral vascular dysfunction is expected to be found in post COVID&#xD;
      individuals and to be correlated to relevant clinical variables (i.e. muscle strength,&#xD;
      respiratory parameters, oxygenation status).&#xD;

    <description>The investigation consists of a non-invasive evaluation by ultrasounds performed on the common femoral artery investigating the speed of arterial blood flow [Leg Blood Flow LBF] and diameter of vessel with a dedicated ultrasound system (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) using Doppler method, before and after a passive flexion-extension movement of the knee. A linear probe will be used with a frequency of 5 MHz. Using the diameter of the artery and the average volume (Vmean), the LBF will be calculated every second with the formula=Average volume*PiGreco*(vessel diameter / 2)2*60.&#xD;
The subject will be placed in a sitting position for 20 minutes before the test. The protocol consists of image acquisition for 60 seconds (basal measurement), followed by a passive flexion-extension of the knee (single passive leg movement). The knee flexion will be performed by health care personnel at a rate of 1 Hz. At the end of the movement, the recording will continue for 60 seconds.</description>
