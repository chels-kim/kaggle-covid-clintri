  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending&#xD;
      intradermal doses of ASP2390 in adult male and female participants allergic to house dust&#xD;
      mites (HDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the effect of multiple ascending intradermal doses of ASP2390&#xD;
      on HDM-specific immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) levels in adult male and female&#xD;
      participants allergic to HDM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening will occur up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible participants will return to&#xD;
      the clinical unit on day -1 (if required by the clinical unit to facilitate the severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] real-time reverse transcription polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction [PCR] procedure) or on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first dose on day 1, all participants will remain in the clinical unit for&#xD;
      observation for approximately 24 hours postdose. After the 24 hours, participants will be&#xD;
      discharged from the clinical unit provided no reactions have occurred that require additional&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subsequent doses, participants will remain under direct observation for a minimum of&#xD;
      1 hour postdose. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit provided no reactions&#xD;
      have occurred that require additional observation.&#xD;

    <description>AEs will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities(MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 will be recorded as an AE. An AE is considered serious if the event: results in death; is life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct normal life functions; results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures) or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization is not caused by an AE); or other medically important events.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Subcutaneous immunotherapy systemic reaction events will be graded using the World Allergy Organization Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System.&#xD;
Each grade is based on organ system involved and severity. Organ systems are defined as cutaneous, conjunctival, upper respiratory, lower respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and other. A reaction from a single organ system such as cutaneous, conjunctival or upper respiratory, but not asthma, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular is classified as a grade 1. Symptom(s)/sign(s) from more than 1 organ system or asthma, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular are classified as grades 2 or 3. Respiratory failure or hypotension with or without loss of consciousness define grade 4 and death grade 5. The grade is determined by the physician's clinical judgement.</description>
