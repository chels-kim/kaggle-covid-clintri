      This study is randomized, double-blind (blinded for the trial subject and the study&#xD;
      physician), placebo-controlled trial in the parallel assignment of the immunogenicity, and&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomized into two groups in the ratio of 1:3; a reference group of 250&#xD;
      subjects receiving placebo and a study group of 750 subjects receiving the Gam-COVID-Vac&#xD;
      combined vector vaccine against the SARS-СoV-2-induced coronavirus infection. The trial&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into five age strata: 18-30, 31-40, 41- 50, 51-60, and 60+ years.&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in the trial for 180±14 days after the first dose of the study&#xD;
      vaccine/placebo and will have in total six on-site visits to the study physician during the&#xD;
      study period and several follow-ups Phone Call/ Teleconsultation during the study as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One Screening visit, i.e., Screening Visit = Day -7 to Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two vaccination visits, i.e.,&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Visit 1 / Day1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tele-consultation / Phone Call to start on Day 2 and a weekly basis until visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Visit 2/ Day 21±2 Days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tele-consultation / Phone Call to occur on Day 22±2 Days then on a weekly basis until&#xD;
           visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four Observational Visits to be scheduled as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3/ Day 28 ±2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly Follow Up Tele-consultation / Phone calls until visit 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4/ Day 42 ±4 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly Follow Up Tele-consultation / Phone Call until visit 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5/ Day 90 ±7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly Follow Up Tele-consultation / Phone Call until visit 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6/ Day 120 ±14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly Follow Up Tele-consultation / Phone calls until visit 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of Study Visit/ Visit 7/ Day 180 ± 14 days The study vaccine/placebo will be&#xD;
           administered intramuscularly during vaccination visits 1 and 2 (day 1 and day 21±2).&#xD;
           Subsequent observation visits 3, 4, 5, 6 and end of study visit / EOS /Visit 7 will be&#xD;
           made on days 28±2, 42±4, 90±7, 120±14 and D180±14 respectively. During the observation&#xD;
           visits, vitals will be assessed in all trial subjects, and changes in the subjects'&#xD;
           condition and wellbeing compared to the previous visit will be recorded. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected per the schedule of assessment from all subjects during the following&#xD;
           visits to assess the following immunogenicity parameters.&#xD;
