      This is a Russian multicenter observational study aimed to assess the mid-term and long-term&#xD;
      prognosis in patients recovered from COVID-19 with the involvement of the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system or with baseline severe cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open multi-center observational study (registry) is designed to enroll consecutive&#xD;
      eligible patients hospitalized with and recovered from COVID-19 (ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2)&#xD;
      with the involvement of the cardiovascular system or with baseline severe cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. Data collection is ongoing for the duration of the pandemic. This study aims to&#xD;
      assess the mid-term and long-term prognosis in this patient population. Analysis of this&#xD;
      information may help to better predict the prognosis for patients and socio-economic burden&#xD;
      of the coincidence of COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases and to better inform about the&#xD;
      optimal surveillance programs in recovered patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The de-identified participant data will be abstracted from the medical chart prospectively on&#xD;
      the day of discharge or retrospectively (on the day of the first outpatient visit) and&#xD;
      entered into an electronic database. The information will be stored in a database, and used&#xD;
      at a later time for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for at least 12 months. Data on standard clinical assessment,&#xD;
      echocardiography, laboratory results, assessment of the current therapy, specific&#xD;
      cardiovascular assessment (depending on the cardiovascular disease), and outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected, as well as additional blood samples for biomarkers substudy and central core&#xD;
      laboratory imaging assessment (when applicable) at 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigators will&#xD;
      contact patients by telephone to obtain information about outcomes in case of inability to&#xD;
      visit in person.&#xD;
