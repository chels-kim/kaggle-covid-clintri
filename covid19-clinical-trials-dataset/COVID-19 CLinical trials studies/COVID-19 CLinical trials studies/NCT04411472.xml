      Clinical phase 3 study to investigate the effect of recAP on 28 day mortality in patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU with acute kidney injury that is caused by sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three distinct SA-AKI trial populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main trial population: Patients with a pre-AKI reference eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and&#xD;
           no proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 at time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 'moderate' CKD population: Patients with a pre-AKI reference eGFR ≥25 and &lt;45&#xD;
           mL/min/1.73 m2 and no proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 at time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A COVID-19 population: Patients with proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 at time of&#xD;
           randomization with or without 'moderate' CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main study population approximately 1400 patients will be enrolled and in the two&#xD;
      cohorts with moderate CKD and COVID-19 each up to 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two arms in the study, one with active treatment and one with an inactive compound&#xD;
      (placebo). Treatment is by 1 hour intravenous infusion, for three days. Patients are followed&#xD;
      up for 28 days to see if there is an improvement on mortality, and followed for 90 and 180&#xD;
      days for mortality and other outcomes e.g. long-term kidney function and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and a major cause of death. Patients&#xD;
      with SA-AKI have a high mortality and morbidity and are at risk of developing chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease. AP is a homodimeric endogenous enzyme present in many cells and organs, e.g.,&#xD;
      intestines, placenta, liver, bone, kidney, and granulocytes. It exerts detoxifying effects&#xD;
      through dephosphorylation of endotoxins; pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules&#xD;
      (PAMPS e.g., lipopolysaccharide) and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS&#xD;
      e.g., adenosine tri- and di-phosphate). In animal models of sepsis and AKI, administration of&#xD;
      AP attenuates the inflammatory response, improves renal function and/or reduces mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AM-Pharma B.V. is developing AP as a novel, recombinant chimeric human AP medicinal product,&#xD;
      called recAP, to be used as an intravenous infusion for the treatment of SA-AKI. In the Phase&#xD;
      2 trial STOP-AKI, a survival benefit was observed in the two highest dose groups, 0.8 mg/kg&#xD;
      and 1.6 mg/kg groups, compared to the placebo group. There were no safety or tolerability&#xD;
      concerns for any of the doses tested (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg). The 1.6 mg/kg recAP dose was&#xD;
      selected for this Phase 3 trial based on the significant survival benefit observed. PK/PD&#xD;
      simulations also confirmed this dose to have the most pronounced treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this Phase 3 trial is to confirm the mortality benefit seen in&#xD;
      STOP-AKI by demonstrating a reduction in 28 day all cause mortality in patients with SA-AKI&#xD;
      treated with 1.6 mg/kg recAP.&#xD;

          2. In the ICU or intermediate care unit for clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have sepsis requiring vasopressor (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine,&#xD;
             phenylephrine, vasopressin, or angiotensin II) therapy, i.e.:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. suspected or proven bacterial or viral infection. and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. on vasopressor therapy (≥0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent) for&#xD;
                  sepsis-induced hypotension for at least one hour despite adequate fluid&#xD;
                  resuscitation according to clinical judgement. Following the initial one hour on&#xD;
                  at least 0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent, any dose of vasopressor&#xD;
                  counts as vasopressor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The combination of a) and b) automatically ensures that patients fulfill the Sepsis 3&#xD;
             criteria as 0.1 µg/kg/min norepinephrine corresponds to a score of +4 on the&#xD;
             Cardiovascular sub-score of the SOFA score.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Use of a non-marketed drug within the last month or concurrent or planned&#xD;

             Co-enrollment or concurrent participation in observational, non-interventional trials&#xD;
             using no protocolized treatments or procedures are always allowed. Co-enrollment or&#xD;
             concurrent participation in trials using protocolized treatments or procedures, e.g.&#xD;

             recent available CR sample at time of screening (NOTE: will often be the sample used&#xD;
             to diagnose AKI). eGFR should be calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
             Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Not feasible to start trial drug within:&#xD;
