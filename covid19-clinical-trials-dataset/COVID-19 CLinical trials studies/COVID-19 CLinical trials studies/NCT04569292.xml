  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's an obsevational retrospective/prospective study. Analyzing the evolution of COVID 19&#xD;
      infection in cancer patients can provide interesting information in the management of these&#xD;
      patients. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to implement a registry to describe&#xD;
      and monitor cancer patients affected by COVID 19, the factors that are associated with an&#xD;
      unfavorable evolution, to develop a strategy for the risk assessment of these patients and&#xD;
      recommendations. relating to their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular attention will be paid to patients suffering from urological tumors because the&#xD;
      treatment followed by the patients would seem to expose them to a greater risk when they are&#xD;
      infected with coronavirus, furthermore, from the literature it is clear that there may be a&#xD;
      connection between sex hormones and ACE2 levels in the plasma. In fact, the estrons&#xD;
      up-regulate the concentration of ACE2 in the circulation and this could be the reason why&#xD;
      women would seem more protected than men once they contract the coronavirus infection&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe cancer patients with COVID-19 and their clinical course;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify predictors of the most severe clinical course;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify prognostic factors; Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor patients with urological tumors with particular attention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosing parameters of inflammation such as IL-6 and IFNα;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the ACE2 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with oncological pathology who contracted COVID 19 infection from January 1, 2020&#xD;
      until the WHO declaration of the end of the pandemic will be studied.&#xD;
