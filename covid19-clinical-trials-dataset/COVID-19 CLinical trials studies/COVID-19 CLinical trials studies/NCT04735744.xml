      SUMMARY Rationale: Allied health professionals (i.e., dietitians, exercise therapists,&#xD;
      physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists) might play&#xD;
      an important role in the recovery of patients with COVID-19 who experience limitations in&#xD;
      daily physical functioning and participation. However, the evidence base for allied&#xD;
      healthcare in patients with COVID-19 has yet to be established. To facilitate care for people&#xD;
      recovering from COVID-19 and to establish this evidence base, the Dutch ministry has created&#xD;
      a temporary regulation for primary care allied healthcare specifically for patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study is setup alongside the temporary regulation and aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      longitudinal recovery trajectories and related costs of patients who visited a primary care&#xD;
      allied healthcare professional for the management of severe symptoms and activity limitations&#xD;
      and/or participation restrictions related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective cohort study. Study population: 1,315 adult patients recovering&#xD;
      from COVID-19 with severe symptoms and activity limitations and/or participation&#xD;
      restrictions, and who are referred to a primary care allied health professional by a general&#xD;
      practitioner or medical specialist within four months of the start of the disease will be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Although the nature of this study is non-experimental, the&#xD;
      allied healthcare intervention can be considered experimental due to the novelty of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome domain of this study is participation&#xD;
      measured with the Utrechtse Schaal voor Revalidatie - Participatie (USER-P). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is set at 6 months. A 5 point difference will be considered clinically relevant for&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: There are no specific risks involved with participation in this study, as it&#xD;
      entails the completion of questionnaires over the timeframe of one year (at the start of the&#xD;
      treatment, the end of the treatment, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months). The load of&#xD;
      the survey will be highest at months 3, 6 and 12 with a total of 74 survey items. Input from&#xD;
      patient representatives suggested that this number of items was feasible, especially because&#xD;
      participants are allowed to complete the survey over a number of days. Finally, none of the&#xD;
      items in the survey are considered emotionally distressing. The prescribed interventions are&#xD;
      conform the recommendations of the best available evidence and are in line with usual allied&#xD;
      healthcare interventions. Therefore, risks are likely to be negligible conform usual allied&#xD;
      healthcare.&#xD;

    <description>We will not develop specific interventions for this prospective observational cohort study. The care provided by allied health professionals in daily practice are based on recommendations published by the professional bodies of allied health professionals and on the interdisciplinary guidance developed by the LAN. All allied health professionals are working according to these recommendations. Dissemination of these recommendations is done by the professional bodies of the allied health professionals. Given the observational nature of our study, no additional implementation strategies will be employed to stimulate this care by the research group.</description>
