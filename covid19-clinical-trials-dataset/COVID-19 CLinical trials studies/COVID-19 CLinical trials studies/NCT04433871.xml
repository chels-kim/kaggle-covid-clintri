  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the description of the first cases of infection in December 2019 in the Hubei province&#xD;
      in China, a new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2), emerged and caused a pandemic. This new virus is responsible for an infectious disease&#xD;
      with respiratory and potent severe symptoms, called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The&#xD;
      first data concerned essentially the adult population and gave a clinical description of the&#xD;
      disease. However, data is missing in the pediatric population. The first published studies&#xD;
      indicate that children seem to have a lower risk to get a severe form of COVID-19. Except the&#xD;
      case of a child with leukemia recently described with the diagnosis of COVID-19, there is&#xD;
      currently no data about pediatric patients with an oncology history or under chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      drugs. Cancers are rare among children and is estimated to concern about 1700 new cases in a&#xD;
      year in France. Malignant tumor or its treatment can affect self-immunity, which could favor&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection or its aggravation. Thus, the investigators propose in this study to&#xD;
      collect data about French children with a cancer and diagnosed with COVID-19.The analysis of&#xD;
      the collected data will refine clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this&#xD;
      population. It will be critical for elaborating recommendations for the management of&#xD;
      COVID-19 in children with cancer.&#xD;

      Since the description of the first cases in December 2019, the world is facing the emergence&#xD;
      of a new coronavirus called &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot; (SARS-CoV-2),&#xD;
      which is responsible for an infectious disease mainly with respiratory manifestation and&#xD;
      potently severe or even lethal, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (N. Zhu et al.&#xD;
      2020; Huang et al. 2020). The global spread of this virus led to the development of an&#xD;
      unprecedented pandemic with an huge impact on public health and from a social and economic&#xD;
      point of view (Ayittey et al. 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First published data mainly concerned the adult population with a detailed COVID-19 clinical&#xD;
      description. Few data are available in children. However, the first studies suggest that&#xD;
      children may be at a lower risk than adults of developing a severe form of COVID-19 (Guan et&#xD;
      al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020; Sinha et al. 2020). Neonatal presentation may be more severe (H.&#xD;
      Zhu et al. 2020). Children seem to present with similar symptoms compared with adults but&#xD;
      often with a milder form (Cao et al. 2020). Radiological findings also appear to be similar&#xD;
      to those in adults (Liu et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2020). Children may be asymptomatic and may&#xD;
      participate in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al. 2020; Chan et al. 2020). Nevertheless,&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 forms were described in children, even if deaths remain extremely rare (Sun&#xD;
      et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020). Among the previous described severe forms, one of the patient&#xD;
      dependent on mechanic ventilation had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Sun et al. 2020). The&#xD;
      publication of Lu et al. probably refers to this patient and it appears that this patient was&#xD;
      receiving a maintenance treatment (Lu et al. 2020). This patient presented a co-infection&#xD;
      with influenza virus, which probably explained his aggravation (Sun et al. 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe COVID-19 presentation in children, adolescent and young adults, this study will&#xD;
      include all patients with the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patient followed-up in any French pediatric oncology and hematology center for a cancer or&#xD;
      a benign tumor treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a targeted therapy and with an&#xD;
      oncologic treatment ongoing or terminated within the last 6 months, or with an hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation history with an immunosuppressive treatment ongoing or terminated&#xD;
      within the last 6 months, or a CAR-T cell therapy history&#xD;
&#xD;
      AND&#xD;
&#xD;
      - PCR or serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Clinical and radiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the following criteria : At&#xD;
      least two of the following signs (three if no history of contact with an individual with a&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19): fever, cough, loss of smell, loss of taste, myalgia, chest pain, breath&#xD;
      shortness, rhinorrhea, acute respiratory signs, diarrhea, headache, recent lethargy, skin&#xD;
      rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AND&#xD;
&#xD;
      - At least one abnormality compatible with COVID-19 on a chest computed tomography scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all included patients, the following informations will be retrieved from their medical&#xD;
      record :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  socio-demographic and anthropometric data: age, sex, weight, height...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cancer history: type of cancer, severity, ongoing or 30-days past oncologic treatment,&#xD;
           significant oncologic treatment with potent impact on COVID-19 evolution (lung surgery,&#xD;
           lung radiotherapy...)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical symptoms at initial stage, at 10-15, 15-20, 20-30 days of evolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biological signs at initial stage, at 10-15, 15-20, 20-30 days of evolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radiological signs at initial stage and on the following exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID-19 management data: oxygen, antiviral agents, antibiotics...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolutive data: resolution/aggravation of infection, potent sequelae...&#xD;
