  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to know the prevalence of mental health problems among undergraduate&#xD;
      students, through internationally and nationally validated screening instruments. The project&#xD;
      also aims to understand better the associated factors contributing to the mental health&#xD;
      problems of this population. Through the critical analysis of the results, our proposal aims&#xD;
      to establish the prevalence of anxiety, depression, suicidality and substance use, and the&#xD;
      association with socioeconomic features, academic stress, sense of belonging to the&#xD;
      university, interpersonal relationships, and sleep habits among other factors. Once finalized&#xD;
      the study, the results obtained will be disseminated to the university community and&#xD;
      published in peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will help the university authorities to design and implement measures to prevent&#xD;
      mental health problems in this community.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Mental health in the university population has become in recent years a common and&#xD;
      serious problem worldwide. There are various studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses&#xD;
      that have been carried out over the past 5 years, which show very worrying figures. In the&#xD;
      USA, it has been described in medical students that between 6.0% and 66.5% have depression,&#xD;
      between 7.7% and 65.5% anxiety disorders, and between 12.2% and 96.7% refer having stress. In&#xD;
      China, on the other hand, a study was reported in 2016 that revealed a prevalence of&#xD;
      depression of 23.8%. In Latin America we find a study carried out in Brazil among medical&#xD;
      students, which shows a prevalence of depression of 30.6%, anxiety disorders of 32.9, and&#xD;
      stress of 49.9%, among other indicators described. In Chile, during 2019 appears the results&#xD;
      of the &quot;First National Survey of Mental Health among university students&quot;, surveying over 600&#xD;
      students from three universities in Chile. This study showed that 46% of the students&#xD;
      presented depressive symptoms, 46% had anxiety symptoms, 53.5% stress symptoms and 29.7%&#xD;
      presented all three symptoms simultaneously. In addition, 5.1% of the students reported&#xD;
      having suicidal thoughts at the time of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple determinants that influence mental health, both social, biological, and&#xD;
      psychological factors. Within these, the socioeconomic levels of the families of origin and&#xD;
      the education attained by their parents stand out, but also the contexts of violence -in its&#xD;
      multiple forms- to which university students may be exposed, levels of stress for academic&#xD;
      reasons, discrimination for various reasons, in addition to poor health in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University students are a group that has certain characteristics in common that makes it&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable in terms of their mental health. Among these factors, we can mention:&#xD;
      the process of adaptation from the school environment to the university environment, the&#xD;
      vocational uncertainty, being subjected to a constant academic workload, responding with&#xD;
      demands of both their own and their environment (such as parents and society), and facing&#xD;
      worries about entering into the world of work. In short, passing through the university is a&#xD;
      period of constant changes, which demands self-management and support, but it also means an&#xD;
      adaptation process that can help to eventually develop mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Universidad de los Andes there are no official published figures on the prevalence of&#xD;
      mental health problems among university students, nor on possible associated factors among&#xD;
      its students. It is important to have a clear and precise current status, as this would allow&#xD;
      the implementation of prevention policies, interventions, and the creation of support&#xD;
      networks that can help students' mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this project is to describe the mental health of the students of the&#xD;
      Universidad de los Andes and its association with individual factors, especially academic&#xD;
      stress, sense of university belonging, peer violence, substance abuse, and sleep habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Participants. All regular undergraduate students from first to last year of&#xD;
      career and older than 18 years old from the Universidad de los Andes will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. The various academic units and faculties have offered support and will join the&#xD;
      study. Participation is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Random sampling will be considered for each stratum defined by the career and&#xD;
      its year, the sample size is determined from the number of enrolled. For this sample&#xD;
      calculation, it has been used as p = 0.1, considering that different studies have estimated&#xD;
      the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the last year of 10% (10). A non-response of 20% is&#xD;
      anticipated, therfore the sample size is increased by that percentage. A total of 4836&#xD;
      students are expected to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments. A detailed description of the instruments can be found in the Outcomes section&#xD;
      of this protocol.&#xD;
