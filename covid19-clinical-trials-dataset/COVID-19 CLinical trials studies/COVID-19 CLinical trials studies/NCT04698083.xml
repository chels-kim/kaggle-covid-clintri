  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), severe dyspnea is the most dramatic&#xD;
      complication.Severe respiratory difficulties may include electrocardiographic frontal QRS&#xD;
      axis rightward shift (Rws) and clockwise rotation (Cwr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated the predictability of advanced lung tomography findings with QRS axis&#xD;
      shift and rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a retrospective analysis of 160 patients.The patients were divided into two groups:&#xD;
      normal oxygen saturation(SpO2) (NS; n = 80) and low SpO2(LS;n = 80).They were then divided&#xD;
      into NS Rws (n = 37), NS leftward shift (Lws; n = 43), LS Rws (n = 40), and LS Lws (n = 40)&#xD;
      according to electrocardiographic follow-up findings. These groups were compared in terms of&#xD;
      electrocardiographic rotation (Cwr, counterclockwise rotation, or normal transition),&#xD;
      tomographic stage (CO-RADS5(advanced)/CO-RADS1-4), electrocardiographic intervals, and&#xD;
      laboratory findings&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lung is the most seriously damaged organ in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).&#xD;
      In patients with advanced lung involvement, the alveoli are filled with fluid, white blood&#xD;
      cells, mucus, and damaged lung cell debris [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrical position of the heart in the frontal plane is defined as normal, right, left,&#xD;
      or northwest quadrant axis deviation, while its position in the horizontal plane is defined&#xD;
      as clockwise rotation (Cwr), normal transition, or counterclockwise rotation (Ccwr)[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      As respiratory disease progresses,rightward shift(Rws) of the frontal QRS axis can result&#xD;
      from Cwr of the heart around its longitudinal axis as viewed from the apex, sudden increase&#xD;
      in pulmonary vascular resistance causing right ventricle dilatation, or both [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiographic changes should be monitored intermittently, as this disease progresses&#xD;
      rapidly to near 50% mortality within 7-28 days [4].The aim of this study was to investigate&#xD;
      whether easily detectable electrocardiographic axis and rotation changes could predict&#xD;
      advanced lung involvement[4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design Records of 250 hospitalized patients with dyspnea and COVID-19 were&#xD;
      analyzed retrospectively.Patients were excluded if they received positive pressurized oxygen&#xD;
      therapy(n:25),underwent mechanical ventilation,(n:15)exhibited atrial fibrillation(n:10),&#xD;
      conditions precluding the assessment of QRS transitional rotation ;complete bundle branch&#xD;
      block(n:10), significant arrhythmias(n:5,complete atrioventricular block(n:2), polymorphic&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia(n:2), and ventricular fibrillation), Wolff-Parkinson-White&#xD;
      syndrome(n:1), supraventricular tachycardia(n:4), or had unclear QRS axis orientation(n:20).&#xD;
      The remaining160 patients who had electronic medical records, nursing records,at least three&#xD;
      electrocardiographic recordings taken a few days apart, and laboratory and tomographic&#xD;
      findings were included in the study.Patients with normal oxygen saturation (SpO2; ≥ 90%) who&#xD;
      did not receive oxygen therapy and patients with low SpO2(&lt;90%) who received nasal oxygen&#xD;
      therapy were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups: normal SpO2(NS,n&#xD;
      = 80) and low SpO2(LS, n = 80).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiographic measurements were performed as previously described.The Tpe (T peak to T&#xD;
      end) interval was measured from precordial leads [5].The delta corrected QT interval(QTc)&#xD;
      calculated as last electrocardiographic QTc minus first electrocardiographic QTc.&#xD;
      Discrepancies between computerized electrocardiographic analysis and the mean of three&#xD;
      computer-aided measurements(Adobe Photoshop program-300dpi resolution) by a researcher were&#xD;
      resolved by consultation with a second researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using follow-up electrocardiography,according to the direction of QRS axis shift between the&#xD;
      first and last electrocardiograms, both groups were divided into two main subgroups:patients&#xD;
      with rightward shift (Rws) and patients with leftward shift(Lws) of the QRS axis.The patient&#xD;
      numbers were as follows: NS Rws (n=37),NS Lws(n=43),LS Rws (n=40),andLS Lws (n=40). Based on&#xD;
      electrocardiographic follow-up analyses,the two main groups were compared in terms of&#xD;
      rotation condition (i.e., Cwr, normal transition, or CCwr), electrocardiographic intervals,&#xD;
      and laboratory findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tomographic findings were evaluated in accordance with COVID-19 Reporting and Data System&#xD;
      (CO-RADS)classification.CO-RADS scores are as follows: 1 (very low level of suspicion), 2&#xD;
      (low level of suspicion), 3 (equivocal), 4 (high level of suspicion),and 5 (very high level&#xD;
      of suspicion)[6].&#xD;
