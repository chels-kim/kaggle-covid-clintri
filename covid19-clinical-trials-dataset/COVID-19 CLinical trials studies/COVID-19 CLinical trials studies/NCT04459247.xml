  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated&#xD;
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the lives of millions of individuals globally and&#xD;
      severely strained the medical community. Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive&#xD;
      individuals far outnumber the symptomatic ones or those with severe disease. The transmission&#xD;
      potential of SARS CoV-2 is potentially greator than earlier viral outbreaks of SARS-CoV and&#xD;
      MERS-CoV. Identification of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection is paramount to&#xD;
      contain viral infection because of high transmission potential Routine measures of social&#xD;
      distancing, personal hand hygiene and limited outdoor contact activities have shown benefits&#xD;
      to limit corona virus infection. However, the role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 infection is&#xD;
      not explored despite the knowledge of an immunomodulatory role and protective effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D against viral infections. It has been found that mortality from COVID-19 is more in&#xD;
      countries with vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation in asymptomatic individuals with vitamin-D&#xD;
      deficiency and COVID-19 is not known. Immune-modulatory effect of vitamin D is likely to be&#xD;
      observed at 25(OH)D levels which are considered higher than that required for normal bone&#xD;
      metabolism.An earlier SARS-CoV-2 negativity may have significant public health benefits in&#xD;
      limiting the spread of the disease. Therefore, we hypothesise that high dose vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency may lead to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      negativity in greater proportions of patients associated with decrease in serological markers&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;

      The role of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation in asymptomatic individuals with vitamin-D&#xD;
      deficiency and COVID-19 is not known. Immune-modulatory effect of vitamin D is likely to be&#xD;
      observed at 25(OH)D levels which are considered higher than that required for normal bone&#xD;
      metabolism.[6] An earlier SARS-CoV-2 negativity may have significant public health benefits&#xD;
      in limiting the spread of the disease. Therefore, we hypothesise that high dose vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency may lead to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      negativity in greater proportions of patients associated with decrease in serological markers&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Consecutive individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were mildly symptomatic or&#xD;
      asymptomatic with or without co-morbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive airway disease, chronic liver disease) admitted to tertiary care hospital in&#xD;
      north India were invited for the study. A written consent was obtained from all patients&#xD;
      included in the study and protocol was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with vitamin D deficiency defined as 25 (OH)D level&lt;20 ng/ml were randomized to&#xD;
      receive daily 60,000IU of cholecalciferol (5 ml oral solution in nano droplet form) for seven&#xD;
      days in the &quot;intervention arm&quot; or to receive a single dose of 60,000 IU vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation at admission in the &quot;control arm&quot;. Patients unable to take oral&#xD;
      supplementation like those requiring invasive ventilation were excluded. Subsequently,&#xD;
      25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7 and a weekly supplementation of 60,000IU provided to&#xD;
      those with 25(OH)D &gt;50 ng/ml or continued on daily vitamin D 60,000 IU supplementation for&#xD;
      another seven days in participants with 25 (OH)D&lt;50ng/ml (day-14) in the intervention arm. No&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation was provided in the control arm other than the initial dose at&#xD;
      hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 (OH)D, serum calcium, phosphorus, fibrinogen , d-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin,&#xD;
      renal and liver function tests were performed periodically up till day-21 or virus&#xD;
      negativity, whichever occurred earlier. Oro-pharyngeal swabs were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      detection at day-5, 7, 10, 14, 18 and 21 and detection was performed by real-time polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (RT-PCR), CFX-96 IVD, Bio-Rad. 25 (OH)D was analysed by&#xD;
      electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (Roche Cobas E 801 Analyzer; Roche Diagnostics),&#xD;
      using the kit supplied by the same manufacturer (Elecsys Total Vitamin D, version 2.0). Serum&#xD;
      calcium (N, 8.5-10.2 mg/dl) and C-reactive protein (N, 0-5 mg/l) were processed by ECLIA&#xD;
      method using Roche Cobas 8000, Roche Diagnostics. D dimer (N, 0-240 ng/ml) &amp; fibrinogen (N,&#xD;
      2-4g/l) were analyzed using Stago Compact/ Stago STA R model, Diagnostica Stago, Inc, USA&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
