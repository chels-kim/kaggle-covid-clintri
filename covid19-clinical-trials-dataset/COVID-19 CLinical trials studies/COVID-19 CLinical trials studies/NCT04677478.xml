  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The respiratory isolation could have a harmful impact on the well-being of patients,&#xD;
      especially in a psychological point of view such as anxiety and depression disorders or&#xD;
      through the relationship with medical team and/or relatives but also in terms of&#xD;
      informations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the impact of respiratory isolation in patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      tuberculosis or COVID-19 could allow to identify the different kinds of problems encountered&#xD;
      by these patients (physical, psychological, sociological, informations, ...) in order to&#xD;
      adapt the environment for efficient care and to improve patient's well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the psychological impact of the respiratory&#xD;
      isolation on the quality of life in patients hospitalized for tuberculosis or COVID-19.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 28 days respiratory isolation</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using SF-36. SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting. Items are grouped into three categories: functional status, well-being, overall health assessment. The scores for the different items are coded and then summed and transformed linearly on a scale ranging from 0 to 100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAY) A+B scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at 28 days respiratory isolation</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is a self-rated scale. Each type of anxiety has its own scale of 20 different questions that are scored. STAY-YA and STAY-YB Scores range from 20 to 80. A higher score is higher anxiety.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life using Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) -13</measure>
    <time_frame>at 28 days respiratory isolation</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-rated scale. each item is made up of 4 sentences corresponding to 4 degrees of intensity of increase in a symptom: from 0 to 3. The overall score is obtained by adding the scores of the 13 items. The range of the scale is 0 to 39.</description>
