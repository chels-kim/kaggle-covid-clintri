      HYPOTHESIS: The administration of vitamin D supplements to patients who have a positive&#xD;
      diagnosis for SARS-Cov-2, acute pneumonia requiring hospital admission and vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency have a more favourable evolution than subjects not treated with vitamin D&#xD;
      (placebo). This favourable evolution will translate into a reduction in mortality, fewer ICU&#xD;
      admissions and fewer days of stay in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRINCIPAL: To assess whether the group of patients receiving vitamin D supplements have a&#xD;
      less severe evolution of their acute pneumonia, translated into lower mortality, than&#xD;
      patients who do not receive that supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY: 1) To determine the number of intensive care admissions and the number of days of&#xD;
      admission in both groups (control group and intervention group). 2) To estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in the patients studied and the effectiveness of its&#xD;
      supplementation. 3) To establish the degree of complexity of each study group and carry out a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: DESIGN: Clinical trial, randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind, with&#xD;
      two parallel groups The active treatment will be vitamin D (Hydroferol soft capsules of 0.266&#xD;
      mg). The placebo will consist of a tablet with the same external characteristics and with the&#xD;
      same treatment scheme but which will not contain any vitamin D active ingredients.&#xD;

      mg). The placebo will consist of a tablet with the same external characteristics and with the&#xD;
      same treatment scheme but which will not contain any vitamin D active ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Adult patients admitted to the Respiratory/Internal Medicine Unit of&#xD;
      Santiago hospital of the OSI Araba HUA for acute pneumonia and suffering from a vitamin D&#xD;
      deficit (&lt; 30 ng/ml) and a RT-PCR, in nasopharyngeal exudate, positive for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: 1)Patients taking any type of vitamin D supplement. 2)Patients with&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism. 3) Patients in whom the administration of vitamin D is formally&#xD;
      contraindicated. 4) Patients who cannot take vitamin D orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUR SIZE: In order to answer to the main objective (mortality reduction 21% versus 50%&#xD;
      intervention and control group respectively), we will need a total sample of 108 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects-54 patients per group (J Crit Care. 2018;44:300-5).Statistical power 90%,95%&#xD;
      statistical significance with possible loss of follow-up of 5% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recruitment period of about 12 months is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: In order to answer to the main and secondary objectives (mortality and&#xD;
      ICU admission), the Chi-square test will be performed and in the event that any of the&#xD;
      frequencies is less than 5, the exact Fisher test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the distribution of the quantitative variables, the Student t-test for&#xD;
      independent samples or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test will be used, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis criterion will be &quot;by intention to treat&quot;. In all cases. The statistical&#xD;
      significance will be 95%.&#xD;

    <description>The administration of vitamin D will be carried out using the following treatment scheme:&#xD;
If vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 30 ng/ml) treatment with 2 capsules of 0.266 mg If vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 40 ng/ml): treatment with 1 capsule of 0.266 mg&#xD;
Blood levels of vitamin D will be determined on day 1, 4, 7 and 14. Based on the results from day 14, a new determination is recommended 4 weeks after starting treatment with the primary care physician who will decide whether to continue or interrupt the treatment. This phase will be carried out outside of the study.&#xD;
In addition, the product should only be administered, if blood calcium and phosphorus levels are within normal limits, as well as if the creatinuria/calciuria ratio is within normal ranges.</description>
