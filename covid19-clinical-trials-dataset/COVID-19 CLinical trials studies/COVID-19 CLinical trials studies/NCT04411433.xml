      This is an open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, phase III trial that&#xD;
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 observed within the last 5 days. 1000 patients&#xD;
      will be randomized in 2:1:2:2:2:1 ratio and divided into six groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical picture of 2019-nCoV disease is in a broad spectrum, which includes asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, and even severe&#xD;
      viral pneumonia with death. Although the mortality rate is not yet clear, the reported&#xD;
      case-fatality risk was 11-14% during the initial studies which included patients with severe&#xD;
      disease. The overall case fatality rate was reported as approximately 2%. In addition, most&#xD;
      cases have resulted in a pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy and ventilator&#xD;
      support. The alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19 caused a global emergency and&#xD;
      this outbreak has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product Favipiravir is an antiviral drug against RNA viruses and has been&#xD;
      stated as effective for the treatment of COVID-19, first emerged from China, in various&#xD;
      clinical studies. In February 2020, Favipiravir was used for the clinical treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19, has been shown to be more effective than the lopinavir / ritonavir combination in&#xD;
      80 people. In recent researches, the drug favipiravir is suggested that it may induce&#xD;
      recovery in a short time in patients with COVID-19-mild type and decrease the treatment&#xD;
      duration from 11 days to 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product hydroxychloroquine sulfate is a 4- aminoquinoline derivative and&#xD;
      widely used for the treatment of many rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to its antimalarial effects. In vitro studies&#xD;
      reported that hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective against many viruses, including&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in many in vitro experiments. Additionally, preliminary results of limited number&#xD;
      of studies have been revealed that hydroxychloroquine sulfate reduces virus load and induces&#xD;
      improvement in patients with COVID-19. This agent has been also suggested to be used in&#xD;
      COVID-19 prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there is no official report on whether hydroxychloroquine combined with&#xD;
      favipiravir show clinical activity against the new coronavirus, COVID-19, in Turkey. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine and&#xD;
      favipiravir in the treatment of Turkey population with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study designed as an open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, phase III&#xD;
      clinical drug trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1000 subjects aged between 18 to 70 years with symptoms and complaints consistent&#xD;
      with possible or confirmed COVID-19 observed within the last 5 days and meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 14 sites.&#xD;
