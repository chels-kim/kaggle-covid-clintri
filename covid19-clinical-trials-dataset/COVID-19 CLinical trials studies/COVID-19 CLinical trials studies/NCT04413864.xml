  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 infection is due to SARS-CoV-2 member of the Coronavirus family represented by SARS-&#xD;
      and MERS-CoVwith neuronal tropism capacity for the brainstem and thalami. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      has(i) central antihypertensive (ii) sedative and (iii) neuroprotective properties and is&#xD;
      often used during patient recovering after mechanical ventilation withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine administration could change the immunomodulatory profile of Covid-19 patients&#xD;
      and reduce inflammatory response.CAM-ICU scores and Blood samples from Covid-19 ICU patients&#xD;
      will be collected at 4 different timepoints (before Dexmedetomidine administration, at D2, D7&#xD;
      and M6) to analyse the inflammatory profile with different approaches:i) chromatin&#xD;
      accessibility, ii) transcriptome analysis, iii) inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels.&#xD;

      Coronaviruses (CoV) cause enteric and respiratory diseases. Most human CoVs, such as hCoV -&#xD;
      229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, cause mild respiratory disease, but the global spread of two&#xD;
      previously well-knownCoVs: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) has proven the lethal potential of human CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While MERS-CoV is still not eliminated from the world, another highly pathogenic CoV,&#xD;
      currently named SARS- CoV-2, started in December 2019 in Wuhan, in China. This new CoV caused&#xD;
      a Chinese outbreak of severe pneumonia (coronavirus 2019 [COVID - 19]), and quickly spread to&#xD;
      other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic analyzes show that SARS-CoV-2 shares a highly homological sequence with other&#xD;
      beta-coronavirus (βCoV) as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some work published in the 2000s has shown the presence of SARS-CoV viruses in neurons.&#xD;
      Similarly, some experimental work has demonstrate that the MERS-COV5 and SARS-CoV6 viruses&#xD;
      detected in the intra-nasal airways have an affinity for several brain regions such as&#xD;
      brainstem or thalami. MERS-Cov viral particles have been found in several organs, including&#xD;
      brain after injection of an inoculum in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies indicate that the brain region involved in this context is the brainstem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The path taken by the virus is not yet clear, but several arguments in the literature&#xD;
      indicate the hematogenous or lymphatic pathway, in particular during the acute phase of the&#xD;
      infection. In addition, a viral invasion of the peripheral nerves could occur, followed by a&#xD;
      secondary cerebral invasion with synaptic transmission already shown for other viruses.&#xD;
      Epidemiological data for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 infection) showing median time between first&#xD;
      symptoms and dyspnea of 5 days, and hospitalization of 7 days10. This delayed period seems&#xD;
      sufficient to allow the virus to invade the central nervous system. A recent work shows that&#xD;
      patients infected with COVID-19 have neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large doses of sedation could be required to control a phase of severe delirium found in&#xD;
      Covid-19 positive patients during the recovering phase in ICU. This delirium could be&#xD;
      explained by the manifestation of septic encephalopathy, or even direct spread of the virus&#xD;
      in the central nervous system. Study of neuroinflammation biomarkers in bleed could&#xD;
      understand the progression of the disease and propose therapeutic strategies according to the&#xD;
      patient phenotype. In this context, the idea of finding a neuroprotective treatment to limit&#xD;
      the toxic effect of this virus on the brain is promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective adrenergic receptor agonist with antihypertensive, hypnotic&#xD;
      and analgesic properties. This molecule has an important capacity of diffusion in the central&#xD;
      nervous system with a central action in the locus cœruleus involved in vigilance thus&#xD;
      explaining its sedative action; it also acts on the posterior grey column also providing&#xD;
      analgesia via hyperpolarization of nerve fibers type C. Its distribution and its elimination&#xD;
      are done according to a bicompartmental model. It is strongly linked to plasma proteins (94%)&#xD;
      and is metabolized by the liver by glucuronidation, with an elimination half-life of two&#xD;
      hours, 90% eliminated by the kidney and 10% in the stool. Dexmedetomidine is a powerful&#xD;
      sympatholytic and should never be administered as a bolus or as a loading dose, it should be&#xD;
      administered as a continuous infusion at a start dose of 0.7 µg / kg / min and then adjusted&#xD;
      to sedation scores between 0,4 and 1,1 µg/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine has neuroprotective effects. In experimental models such as the&#xD;
      intraperitoneal injection of LPS, spinal cord lesions and ischemia-reperfusion,&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine lower the cerebral inflammation directly on the microglial phenotype. The&#xD;
      molecular pathway involved is not clear yet, however several studies show an action of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine on the MAP kinase pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine could be a direct neuroprotective agent by decreasing the brain inflammation&#xD;
      induced by Covid-19 infection. Adapted utilisation of Dexmedetomidine for each patient&#xD;
      profile could facilitate recovery and shorten the stay of patients in intensive care.&#xD;
