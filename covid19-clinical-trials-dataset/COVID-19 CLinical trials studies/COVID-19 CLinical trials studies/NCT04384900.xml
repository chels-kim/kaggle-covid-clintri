  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prone position ventilation is frequently used in the ICU to treat severe hypoxemia in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of the&#xD;
      PROVENT-COVID study is to assess whether applying prone position ventilation immediately&#xD;
      after intubation reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation compared to prone position&#xD;
      ventilation according to standard criteria for prone position.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with COVID-19 the incidence of ARDS is 15% and the all-cause mortality 4%. No&#xD;
      treatment has been shown to improve the outcome of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation in the prone position decreases mortality with around 50% when applied&#xD;
      to patients with severe respiratory failure. Applying prone position earlier in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 could have several benefits, but may also carry significant side-effects and an&#xD;
      increased workload for the health-care personnel. It is urgently needed to assess whether&#xD;
      this potential life-saving intervention is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PROVENT-COVID is to determine whether prone position ventilation, initiated&#xD;
      immediately after intubation, lead to more days alive without respiratory support compared to&#xD;
      prone position initiated according to standard indication in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      associated respiratory failure.&#xD;

    <description>Prone position ventilation initiated as soon as possible following intubation. The patients are maintained in a prone position for 12-16 hrs daily for 5 days, unless one of the following criteria are met: Substantial improvement and/or imminent extubation, Worsening oxygenation with prone position, Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) occurring during a prone session and leading to its immediate interruption. Following the five day intervention period, prone position ventilation will be continued according to the intervention in the control group</description>

Until one of the following are met: Substantial improvement and/or imminent extubation, Worsening oxygenation with prone position, Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) occurring during a prone session and leading to its immediate interruption.</description>
