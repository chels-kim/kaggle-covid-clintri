  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that patients who have contracted COVID-19 retain very significant&#xD;
      fatigue after resolving the infectious episode. This fatigue may be explained by low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation. There is more data for patients with COVID-19 who have been hospitalized than&#xD;
      for non-hospitalized patients with milder forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, COVID-19 related fatigue would not only affect elderly people with severe&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary consequences but also young subjects without severities. This notion is not&#xD;
      very widespread and to date, COVID contracted by young subjects is considered to have very&#xD;
      few consequences on their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also known that the prevalence of sleep debt is significant in the general population&#xD;
      and particularly in young people, and it is also known that sleep deprivation increases&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation and facilitates the risk of viral contamination. The association&#xD;
      between sleep deprivation, drowsiness and possibly low-grade inflammation raise questions&#xD;
      about the mechanisms of fatigue in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are also entitled to wonder to what extent the chronic sleep debt suffered by&#xD;
      the French population can explain an increased risk of contamination by COVID 19 but also&#xD;
      significant residual fatigue after COVID infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bordeaux University Hospital screens 2,000 subjects per day at risk of being infected by&#xD;
      COVID, it would be very interesting to measure, in a population of young adults aged 18-45&#xD;
      years, frequently exposed to a sleep debt, sleep hygiene (bedtime and wake-up times, sleep&#xD;
      and wake-up schedules, and overall sleep satisfaction), average sleep duration, level of&#xD;
      fatigue and drowsiness and to compare these thresholds between subjects with or without COVID&#xD;
      19 according to nasopharyngeal PCR.&#xD;
