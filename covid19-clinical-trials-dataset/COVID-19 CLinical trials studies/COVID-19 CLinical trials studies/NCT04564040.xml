  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is being conducted to support the clinical development of acalabrutinib in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients who are unable to swallow acalabrutinib tablet or capsule due to&#xD;
      respiratory failure, eg, they may require endotracheal intubation for ventilator support and&#xD;
      nasogastric (NG) tube placement, and it is important to have a clinically acceptable method&#xD;
      to administer acalabrutinib via NG tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is designed to evaluate relative bioavailability by comparing the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of AT suspension in water administered via NG tube with the PK of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib capsule suspension in flat COCA-COLA administered via NG tube. Additionally,&#xD;
      the PPI effect will be evaluated by comparing the PK of AT suspension in water administered&#xD;
      via NG tube plus rabeprazole with the PK of AT suspension in water administered via NG tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study is designed to evaluate the effect of NG administration on AT by&#xD;
      comparing the PK of AT suspension in water administered via NG tube with the PK of AT orally&#xD;
      administered with water.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit within 7 to 10 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a minimum washout period of 4 days between treatment periods. Up to 20 subjects&#xD;
