      This expanded access program will provide access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma 150 or more&#xD;
      individuals with moderate to severe or life-threatening manifestations of COVID-19, or&#xD;
      documented to be at high risk of developing such manifestations at participating hospitals in&#xD;
      Colorado.COVID-19 convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from&#xD;
      patients who have recovered from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convalescent plasma collected from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 contains&#xD;
      antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary evidence and data collected during other respiratory&#xD;
      virus outbreaks (including the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza virus&#xD;
      pandemic, and the 2012 MERS-CoV epidemic) suggest that the antibodies in convalescent plasma&#xD;
      may be effective in fighting the infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma will be obtained from FDA registered blood banks and will meet&#xD;
      all regulatory requirements for conventional plasma and FDA's additional considerations for&#xD;
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma&#xD;
      (https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemptio&#xD;
      n-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this expanded access program is to provide COVID-19 convalescent&#xD;
      plasma to patients with moderate to severe or life-threatening manifestations of COVID-19, or&#xD;
      documented to be at high risk of developing such manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be the evaluation of safety, as assessed by incidents of adverse&#xD;
      events judged by the treating physician to be potentially related to the administration of&#xD;
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives will include assessments for antibody responses for patients that&#xD;
      receive convalescent plasma. An exploratory analysis may be conducted correlating the level&#xD;
      of neutralizing antibody titers with clinical outcomes observed. Due to the need to&#xD;
      monitoring COVID19 antibody responses following infusion, blood testing at day 1&#xD;
      post-treatment and at discharge will be obtained as part of enrollment.&#xD;
