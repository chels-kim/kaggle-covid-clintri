      Pilot study into low dose naltrexone (LDN) and NAD+ for treatment of patients with&#xD;
      post-COVID-19 syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study will assess the use of low dose naltrexone&#xD;
      (LDN) and NAD+ for the treatment of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (long-COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 1-4 months before enrollment will be included.&#xD;
      Subjects should have self diagnosed post-COVID19 syndrome and experiencing persistent fatigue&#xD;
      since positive test. Patients will be screened using the fatigue survey and cases with a&#xD;
      moderate to severe score will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive LDN and NAD+ treatment or a corresponding placebo tablet and patch&#xD;
      (control group) for 12 weeks. In this study, fatigue and quality of life will be assessed&#xD;
      using validated surveys. Surveys will be conducted at baseline (at the time of enrollments,&#xD;
      before treatment), and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The improvement of scores from baseline&#xD;
      levels will be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Reduction of fatigue score from baseline as measured by the Chalder fatigue scale in post-COVID-19 syndrome by treatment with LDN and NAD+. The Chalder scale has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 33, and the higher the score the more severe the fatigue symptoms are.</description>

    <description>LDN will be used at a dosage of 4.5 mg/day, which will be taken orally in the form of capsules. NAD+ will be administered using the IontoPatch iontophoresis patch containing 400 mg of NAD+ solution which is worn on the skin for 4-6 hours once per week.</description>

    <description>NAD+ will be applied using iontophoresis patches. The patches will be provided by ready-made NAD+ solutions (400 mg) to be applied to the positive electrode of the patch and saline to the negative electrode. The patch is powered by a self-contained battery, producing an electric current to facilitate NAD+ absorption through the skin into the blood. Patches are worn for 4-6 hours once a week.</description>
