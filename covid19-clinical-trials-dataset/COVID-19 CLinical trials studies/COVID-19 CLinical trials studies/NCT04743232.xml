  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the Corona Virus Pandemic health care resources have become scare, and the pandemic&#xD;
      has brought forth the need for risk stratification of patients suffering from COVID19 in&#xD;
      order to allocate resources appropriately. One of scarcest resources is Intensive Care&#xD;
      treatment, mostly related to the need for invasive ventilation or for (post) cardiac arrest&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify patients for whom ICU-treatment is most successful and those for whom it would be&#xD;
      futile, would allow for installing appropriate advanced care directives for escalation or&#xD;
      limitation of treatment.&#xD;

      Disease resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) has a high mortality rate with deaths predominantly caused by respiratory&#xD;
      failure. As of 1 September 2020, over 25 million people had confirmed coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19) worldwide and at least 850 000 people had died from the disease. As hospitals&#xD;
      around the world are faced with an influx of patients with COVID-19, there is an urgent need&#xD;
      for a pragmatic risk stratification tool that will allow the early identification of patients&#xD;
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are at the highest risk of death to guide management and&#xD;
      optimise resource allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As is apparent not only from medical literature, but also from popular media, there is a need&#xD;
      for risk stratification and decision aid. The problem with our current health care capacity&#xD;
      mainly pertains to ICU-admissions. Ideally, clinicians would be able to predict who benefits&#xD;
      from invasive ICU-treatment, and who does not. Subsequently, patients for whom ICU-admission&#xD;
      is futile,doctors can install advanced care directives to refrain from escalation and limit&#xD;
      the curative treatment they receive, and rather focus on palliation. As the investigators of&#xD;
      this study previously discovered, patients are not unwilling to discuss these matters. In&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients, three interventions seem logical to warrant special attention:&#xD;
      ICU-admission, invasive ventilatory support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The latter&#xD;
      because mortality in cardiac arrest patients with concurrent COVID appears higher than in&#xD;
      non-COVID patients and performing CPR in patients with contagious diseases can potentially&#xD;
      bring harm to health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic scores attempt to transform complex clinical pictures into tangible numerical&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutch clinicians in general have been particularly busy identifying and providing prognostic&#xD;
      scores for mortality and ICU-admission. Recent reviews listed many prognostic scores used for&#xD;
      COVID-19, which varied in their setting, predicted outcome measure, and the clinical&#xD;
      parameters included. It also highlights the importance of age, something that has been a&#xD;
      subject to political debate. Therefore, in the past months, two Dutch research groups and one&#xD;
      British group have developed two prognostic scores:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. COVID Outcome Prediction in the Emergency department:&#xD;
&#xD;
           COPE (ErasmusMC, NL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department in Acutely Ill Older Patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISE-UP (MUMC+, NL) 3. The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections&#xD;
      Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium of the World Health Organisation:&#xD;
      4C-score (UK)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-COVID patients, the Good Outcome for Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) score serves as&#xD;
      an acceptable prognostic tool for the prognosis of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). To&#xD;
      date, no prognostic tool has been developed for CPR in COVID-patients. Last April, the Dutch&#xD;
      board of intensive care medicine (NVIC) wrote a handbook to guide clinicians during the phase&#xD;
      of the pandemic where resources would be limited to none (Code Black). In this handbook they&#xD;
      summed up criteria in patients for whom ICU-admission would be futile or not-recommendable.&#xD;
      Among these criteria was cardiac arrest. These criteria have however never been researched.&#xD;
      Furthermore, although this handbook is necessary, there is no guidance for installing&#xD;
      advanced care directives in the current stage of the pandemic, i.e. situations which are not&#xD;
      Code Black - situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to implement a clinical decision tool to aid clinicians in&#xD;
      establishing advanced care directives about escalation and limitation of treatment in&#xD;
      COVID-patients. The decision tool will provide two novelties: 1) A structured approach to&#xD;
      discussing advanced care directives with patients who need to be admitted to hospital, and 2)&#xD;
      A comprehensive oversight of available risk scores. The decision tool will not provide&#xD;
      cut-off values or dichotomous decisions, this will be left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      responsible physician. The secondary goal is to evaluate the use of this decision tool in&#xD;
      terms of ICU-admissions, mortality and health care professionals' satisfaction with the&#xD;
      implemented decision tool.&#xD;
