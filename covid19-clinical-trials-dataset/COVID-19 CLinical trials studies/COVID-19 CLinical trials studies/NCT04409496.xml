      This pilot trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of chat-based instant messaging support&#xD;
      in preventing smoking relapse in recent tobacco abstainers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation is one of the most cost-effective health interventions, which can add up to&#xD;
      10 years of life expectancy (Jha et al., 2013). However, it is very difficult to quit smoking&#xD;
      because of the addictive effect of nicotine presents in tobacco products, and smokers&#xD;
      typically make multiple attempts before successfully quit smoking. Providing evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment could substantially increase the chance of successful quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) provided new opportunities and challenges in&#xD;
      promoting smoking cessation. A growing literature has shown that smoking is linked to poor&#xD;
      progression of COVID-19 (Patanavanich &amp; Glantz, 2020), which can be a new warning for&#xD;
      motivating smokers to quit smoking. However, social distancing measures and increased stress&#xD;
      and anxiety related to fear of contracting COVID-19 may increase the risk of smoking relapse&#xD;
      in people who recently quit smoking (Patwardhan, 2020). There are also misinformation or&#xD;
      unproven claims that smoking can protect against COVID-19. The social distancing measures&#xD;
      also become a barrier for smokers who are interested in quitting to receive treatment from&#xD;
      smoking cessation clinics. Therefore, implementing new interventions that can address the&#xD;
      challenges in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advance in mobile technologies provides a new avenue for delivering smoking cessation&#xD;
      support. A qualitative interview of 21 current smokers in Hong Kong has found that mobile&#xD;
      instant messaging app (e.g., WhatsApp) is an acceptable and feasible platform for providing&#xD;
      chat support for smoking cessation (Luk et al., 2019). Chat-based support allows a registered&#xD;
      nurse or trained counsellor to interact with a smoker individually through mobile instant&#xD;
      messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp and WeChat) and provide real-time, continuous, and&#xD;
      personalized smoking cessation information and advice. A randomised trial of 1185 smokers&#xD;
      found that the chat-based intervention integrated with brief intervention was effective in&#xD;
      increasing smoking cessation (Wang et al., 2019). The trial also provided initial evidence&#xD;
      that the intervention can be delivered as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with use&#xD;
      of existing cessation treatment, to increase the chance of successful quitting. This study&#xD;
      aims to adapt the chat intervention for smoking relapse prevention and evaluate its&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness in recent tobacco abstainers enrolled in a clinic-based smoking&#xD;
      cessation service in Hong Kong.&#xD;
