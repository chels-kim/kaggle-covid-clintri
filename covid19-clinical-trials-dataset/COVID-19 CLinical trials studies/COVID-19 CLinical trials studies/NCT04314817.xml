  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of Covid-19 started several clinical trials and treatment experiments all over&#xD;
      the world in the first months of 2020. This study investigates reports of adverse events&#xD;
      related to used molecules, including but not limited to protease inhibitors&#xD;
      (lopinavir/ritonavir), chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and interferon beta-1a. Analyses&#xD;
      of reports also include the International classification of disease ICD-10 for treatments in&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database&#xD;
      (VigiBase).&#xD;
