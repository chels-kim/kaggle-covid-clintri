    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the associations between vascular parameters and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vascular function and structure of individuals with COVID-19 admitted to the General&#xD;
      Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo will be assessed in the first 72 hours of&#xD;
      hospitalization. Then, participants will be followed up until hospital discharge/death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistical regressions will be run to evaluate if vascular function/structure can predict ICU&#xD;
      admissions, intubation, thrombosis or death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study conducted at the General Hospital of the University of São&#xD;
      Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP). Male and female participants with SARS-CoV-2 and recently&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital (≤ 72 hours) will be recruited at the emergency department and&#xD;
      outpatient clinics at the HCFMUSP. Immediately upon recruitment, participants will perform&#xD;
      the assessment of flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery and the assessment of carotid&#xD;
      intima-media thickness. Subsequently, they will be followed during the entire period of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will employ as primary endpoint a composite of ICU admission, intubation or&#xD;
      mortality during the period of hospitalization. Cardiovascular complications, such as&#xD;
      arterial (AE), deep venous (DVP) or pulmonary embolism (PE) , acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (AMI), stroke, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation and acute kidney injury will be considered&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between the vascular parameters and clinical outcomes will be examined by a&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
