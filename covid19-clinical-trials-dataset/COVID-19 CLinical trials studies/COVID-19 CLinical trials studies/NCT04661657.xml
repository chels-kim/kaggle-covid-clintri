    <textblock>
      COLUMBIA CARDS is a pilot study to understand how COVID-19 affects the heart. It is known&#xD;
      that COVID-19 can affect the heart in different ways. COLUMBIA CARDS is studying why some&#xD;
      COVID-19 survivors develop clinical conditions such as heart inflammation, fluid buildup,&#xD;
      blood clots, and other cardiac problems during or after their COVID-19 illness, and why other&#xD;
      ones do not. In this study, we will use cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the&#xD;
      heart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study aiming to collect preliminary data on cardiac imaging (CMR and TTE) in&#xD;
      outpatients who recovered from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR offers the unique ability to comprehensively characterize myocardial tissue and assess&#xD;
      the heart's structure and function, through a variety of complementary imaging techniques&#xD;
      using different pulse sequences. The investigators propose to provide a multi-sequence CMR&#xD;
      evaluation of a spectrum of convalescent COVID-19 patients, compare COVID-19 survivors to&#xD;
      controls, and study the relationships between myocardial characteristics by CMR and&#xD;
      echocardiography and health outcomes, and how these are modulated through patient&#xD;
      characteristics, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 illness. Broadly, this myocardial&#xD;
      characterization will not just provide diagnosis but serve as a potentially powerful tool for&#xD;
      risk stratification, therapeutic decision making, and monitoring response to therapies in&#xD;
      COVID-19 survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most widely used imaging technique for the&#xD;
      assessment of cardiac morphology and function. While its capability for myocardial tissue&#xD;
      characterization is inferior to that of CMR, TTE provides several advantages that make it an&#xD;
      ideal complement to CMR for the assessment of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients. TTE&#xD;
      offers a rapid noninvasive evaluation of myocardial and valvular function, in addition to the&#xD;
      assessment of other cardiac abnormalities of interest (such as presence and amount of&#xD;
      pericardial effusion) and important hemodynamic variables (noninvasive estimation of&#xD;
      pulmonary pressures is an example). TTE is easily performed and reproducible, and does not&#xD;
      involve the use of radiations or contrast agents, which allows the performance of repeat&#xD;
      evaluations to assess serial changes over time in the cardiac parameters of interest.&#xD;
