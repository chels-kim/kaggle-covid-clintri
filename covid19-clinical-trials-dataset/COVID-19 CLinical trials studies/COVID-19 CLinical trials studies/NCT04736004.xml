      The Hearts of Athletes study is being conducted to determine the heart involvement with&#xD;
      COVID-19 in athletes. This study aims to enroll any Adult (18 years of age or greater)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Athlete is defined as NCAA Collegiate Athlete, Professional Athlete, or Olympic Athlete&#xD;
      will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      • COVID-19 diagnosed via an RT-PCR (nasal or throat swab test) at least 10 days and less than&#xD;
      6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Or without COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Identified as a local Control participant (similar sport) to a participant with COVID-19,&#xD;
      who is willing to undergo a standard cardiovascular evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with and without COVID-19 will use their mobile devices to provide health&#xD;
      information, like symptoms, by answering survey questions daily for 30 days. Also,&#xD;
      participants will allow their de-identified cardiac images to be sent to the Duke Heart&#xD;
      Center for blinded analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No physical risks are associated with this study. One possible risk, although minimal, is&#xD;
      loss of confidentiality.&#xD;
