  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: On December 2019, a new human coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was detected in&#xD;
      China. Its infectivity and virulence characteristics caused a rapid spread, being declared&#xD;
      pandemic on March 2020. The mortality attributed to the infection ranges between 3 and 10%.&#xD;
      Main risk factors are age, male sex, and chronic degenerative comorbidities. Due to the&#xD;
      absence of therapeutic options, potential alternatives such as human immunoglobulin or plasma&#xD;
      from convalescent patients have been administered. Due to the severity of the disease and the&#xD;
      associated mortality, it is urgent to find therapeutic alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of the administration of Convalescent plasma vs&#xD;
      human immunoglobulin in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Randomized Controlled trial of patients diagnosed with respiratory&#xD;
      infection by COVID-19, with severe respiratory failure without indication of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, or those who due to their severity are intubated upon admission. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed 2:1 to receive plasma from convalescent patients or human immunoglobulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be time to discharge from hospital for improvement. The&#xD;
      safety outcomes will be: Kirby index (PaO2/FiO2) evolution and dead.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      I. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In late December 2019, the health authorities of the Popular Republic of China reported&#xD;
      several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On&#xD;
      December 31, 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began etiological&#xD;
      and epidemiological research on this disease. Three samples of bronchoalveolar lavage were&#xD;
      taken from patients from the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan and through various processes they&#xD;
      came to identify a new coronavirus that they initially called on January 7, 2020 as:&#xD;
      2019-nCoV. On January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) made the first&#xD;
      recommendations on the epidemiological surveillance of this new coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On January 22, 2020, the first session of the Emergencies Committee was convened by WHO in&#xD;
      Geneva, Switzerland and on January 30 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance&#xD;
      (ESPII) was declared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On February 11, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy named this new coronavirus as&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and responds to &quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 &quot;(Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2), the WHO proposes that same day to call the disease&#xD;
      caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first case reported in Latin America was in Brazil on February 26 and on the 28th of the&#xD;
      same month, Mexico communicates its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in a&#xD;
      35-year-old patient from a trip to Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19, on March 11, WHO&#xD;
      Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declares the SARS-CoV-2.5 outbreak as a pandemic.&#xD;
      A high percentage of patients especially over 50 y with comorbidities require hospitalization&#xD;
      and intensive care. Mortality of patients with invasive mechanical intubation has been&#xD;
      reported up to 61% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, there are no treatment that has shown clinical efficacy, so the plasma from&#xD;
      convalescent patients and human immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been proposed as alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human immunoglobulin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no controlled studies with the use of IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
      In observational reports it was found in three patients with early forms in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for pneumonia secondary to COVID-19, treated with IVIG at a dose of 0.3 - 0.5 gr&#xD;
      / kg. All three patients showed clinical improvement, so this study justified the start of a&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational experience with important limitations in its report, describes the&#xD;
      experience with 58 patients with severe pneumonia who found differences in mortality at 28&#xD;
      days when they divided the groups according to the IVIG administration time (48 hours),&#xD;
      emphasizing the importance of early application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In similar situations historically diverse scenarios have been found where IVIG has been&#xD;
      administered with apparent success. However, there are no clinical trials supporting its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convalescent patient plasma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of plasma from convalescent patients for the treatment of severe infection by COVID19&#xD;
      has been considered as a first-line therapeutic option since the start of the pandemic. The&#xD;
      seroconversion of the patients during the first months of the outbreak was unknown, being an&#xD;
      obstacle to recommend this type of treatment. Very recently, the serological behavior of 285&#xD;
      patients was published; 100% of the patients have detected antibodies 19 days after detection&#xD;
      of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiences reported so far are only case series without simultaneous comparative groups.&#xD;
      Viral clearance has been effective, in all included patients in a small series of 6 patients.&#xD;
      This viral clearance was not accompanied by mortality benefits, the authors suggesting that&#xD;
      it was probably due to the late administration of plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data supporting the use of convalescent plasma for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&#xD;
      are limited to case reports and case series. Use in case series for severe infections due to&#xD;
      MERS, Ebola and influenza have reported clinical improvement, although none of the studies&#xD;
      were conducted comparatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks associated with plasma transfusion include TRALI, transfusion-associated circulatory&#xD;
      overload, and allergic transfusion reactions. Rare complications include transmission of&#xD;
      infectious diseases and alloimmunization of red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials are underway to evaluate both convalescent plasma and IVIG from SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      for the treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved a national expanded access program for the use of convalescent plasma&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Physicians can refer to the National&#xD;
      Convalescent Plasma Project COVID-19 website for more information. People who have fully&#xD;
      recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks and are interested in donating plasma can&#xD;
      contact their local blood donor or plasma collection center or consult the American Red Cross&#xD;
      website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national transfusion center in Mexico has published guidelines for the use of serum from&#xD;
      convalescent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Definition of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection has had a high rate of spread. In patients with comorbidities and over 50&#xD;
      years, the infection has presented the highest rate of respiratory deterioration and the&#xD;
      requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation. Due to the absence of specific treatment,&#xD;
      various alternatives have been explored. In critically ill patients, the administration of&#xD;
      human immunoglobulin and plasma from convalescent patients have emerged as potential rescue&#xD;
      therapies. The proposed treatments have an adequate margin of safety due to routine clinical&#xD;
      use in other settings. Due to this, in conjunction with the urgent need to seek therapeutic&#xD;
      alternatives, controlled studies are required without assuming efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Justification COVID-19 infection has collapsed health systems in almost all the&#xD;
      countries due to the large number of patients requiring respiratory assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard treatment for the management of this infection and the focus has been on&#xD;
      the already known life support and management of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome in&#xD;
      critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments used empirically have an adequate safety profile due to the experience in&#xD;
      other clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of these empirical alternatives should be based on clinical trials since efficacy and&#xD;
      safety should not be assumed in the group of patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Miguel Hidalgo Centennial Hospital has been designated as a hospitalization center for&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients who do not have Social Security in the state of Aguascalientes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with COVID19 infection with severe respiratory failure or requiring invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, plasma treatment of convalescent patients will be superior to&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of complications: deterioration&#xD;
      of the oxygenation index or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. General objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and efficacy of plasma administration of convalescent patients or&#xD;
      immunoglobulin in patients with severe COVID-19 infection with severe respiratory failure or&#xD;
      requiring mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess viral clearance time using PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial, Included patients will be randomized (2:1) to receive one of two&#xD;
      maneuvers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Plasma donated from convalescent patients will be extracted in strict compliance&#xD;
      with the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of a clinical event with symptoms attributed to COVID-19 and a positive PCR test&#xD;
           for COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further confirmation of a negative PCR test for COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to be eligible plasma donors must complete at least 14 days after the last&#xD;
           negative PCR in the absence of any symptom attributable to COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IgG antibodies for COVID-19 must be confirmed POSITIVE when a qualitative assay is being&#xD;
           used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When quantification of IgG antibodies for COVID-19 is available a title &gt; 1: 640 will be&#xD;
           required for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis will be used as the only method for plasma extraction. Infusion of 400 ml of&#xD;
           Plasma will be infused&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Human immunoglobulin 0.3 gr / kg (5 doses)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Definition of the variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days of hospitalization: Days from admission as a suspected case of COVID with&#xD;
      hospitalization criteria until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital discharge criteria: negative PCR for COVID-19, oxygen saturation in ambient air &gt;&#xD;
      90%, absence of fever and dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen supplementation requirement: This is based on the modality and FiO2 necessary to&#xD;
      maintain a saturation of 90% of ambient air without respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory distress syndrome: Respiratory rate greater than 25 x minute and use of accessory&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory failure: Saturation to ambient air below 90% or PO2 below 60 mmHg. Septic Shock:&#xD;
      Requirement of vasoactive amines to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg, in a&#xD;
      patient previously with adequate water resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFA: Organic failure scale that includes: PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, platelet count, bilirubin,&#xD;
      blood pressure, Glasgow scale and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APACHE 2: Morbidity scale in intensive care. PaO2 / FiO2 Index: Ratio of oxygen pressure to&#xD;
      inspired fraction of oxygen RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2: Quantitative measurement by RT-PCR method&#xD;
      usually performed on blood. It will be evaluated as a start for diagnosis and then a test&#xD;
      will be repeated on days 5, 14 and 21 to assess viral clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory markers: Laboratory studies used as markers of disease severity, consist of&#xD;
      procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, blood cytometry, dimer-D, ferritin.&#xD;
