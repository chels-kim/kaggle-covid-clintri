    <textblock>
      A phase 2/3 study to determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in healthy UK volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 11 study groups and it is anticipated that a total of 12,390 volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Groups 1, 7 &amp; 9 are adults aged 56-69 years; groups 2, 8 &amp; 10 are adults 70 years&#xD;
      and over; groups 4, 5 &amp; 6 are adults aged 18-55 years; group 11 is adults aged 18-55 years&#xD;
      who have previously received a ChAdOx vectored vaccine; group 12 is HIV positive adults aged&#xD;
      18-55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be administered intramuscularly into the deltoid of the non-dominant arm&#xD;
      (preferably).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo follow-up for a total of 1 year post last vaccination. Additional&#xD;
      visits or procedures may be performed at the discretion of the investigators, e.g., further&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, or additional blood tests and other investigations&#xD;
      if clinically relevant&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with&#xD;
             their General Practitioner and access all medical records when relevant to study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females of childbearing potential only, willingness to practice continuous&#xD;
             effective contraception (see below) during the study and a negative pregnancy test on&#xD;
             the day(s) of screening and vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Inclusion criteria to Group 12 (HIV sub-study):&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Receiving antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undetectable HIV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Participation in COVID-19 prophylactic drug trials for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Participation in COVID-19 treatment trials is allowed in the event of hospitalisation&#xD;
        due to COVID-19. The COV002 study team should be informed as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Participation in SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys where participants are informed of their&#xD;
        serostatus for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Disclosure of serostatus post enrolment may accidently unblind participants to group&#xD;
        allocation. Participation in COV002 can only be allowed if volunteers are kept blinded to&#xD;
        their serology results from local/national serological surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vaccine (licensed or investigational) other than the study intervention&#xD;
             within 30 days before and after each study vaccination, with the exception of the&#xD;

             Participants will be encouraged to receive these vaccinations at least 7 days before&#xD;
             or after their study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or planned receipt of an investigational or licensed vaccine or product likely&#xD;
             to impact on interpretation of the trial data (e.g. Adenovirus vectored vaccines, any&#xD;
             coronavirus vaccines). This exclusion criteria will not apply to group 11, as&#xD;
             recruitment will be targeted at those volunteers who previously received a ChAdOx1&#xD;
             vectored vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months&#xD;
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state (except group&#xD;
             12, where HIV infected participants are allowed); asplenia; recurrent severe&#xD;
             infections and use of immunosuppressant medication within the past 6 months, except&#xD;
             topical steroids or short-term oral steroids (course lasting ≤14 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of serious psychiatric condition likely to affect participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding disorder (e.g. factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder), or&#xD;
             prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or&#xD;
             venepuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continuous use of anticoagulants, such as coumarins and related anticoagulants (i.e.&#xD;
             warfarin) or novel oral anticoagulants (i.e. apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and&#xD;
             edoxaban)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected or known current alcohol or drug dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase&#xD;
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of&#xD;
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal disease, endocrine disorder and&#xD;
             neurological illness (mild/moderate well controlled comorbidities are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (except groups 5d, 5e, 5f, 9, 10 and 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 before enrolment (except groups 5d, 5e, 5f, 9, 10 and 11)&#xD;

             paracetamol chronically&#xD;
&#xD;
        Re-vaccination exclusion criteria (two-dose groups only)&#xD;
