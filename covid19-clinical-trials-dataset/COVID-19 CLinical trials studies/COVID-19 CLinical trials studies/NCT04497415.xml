      The overarching goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of a brief video intervention&#xD;
      in reducing stigma and fear, and improving help-seeking behavior, among health care providers&#xD;
      (N=1,200), with pre- post- and follow-up assessments (at day 14 and day 30). Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited via Amazon Turk and randomly assigned to either a) a video-based&#xD;
      intervention (day 1 and a &quot;booster intervention&quot; of the same content on day 14 of the study)&#xD;
      featuring the personal story of a health care provider during COVID-19 pandemic, his/her&#xD;
      struggles and barriers to care, (b) video-based intervention (day 1 only), and a written&#xD;
      description of the same story on day 14 (c) no-intervention control arm (questionnaires&#xD;
      only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invetsigators aim to (1) determine whether video-based intervention reduce stigma and&#xD;
      fear, and increase help-seeking behavior in relation to COVID-19 among health care providers,&#xD;
      and (2) compare high-risk areas (e.g., NY) to low-risk areas (e.g., Montana) on intervention&#xD;
      outcomes, and (3) test whether symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD and Moral Injury&#xD;
      (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7),&#xD;
      the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) and the Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES))&#xD;
      would change over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely and rapidly spread around the world. To&#xD;
      effectively respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, various governments have implemented rapid and&#xD;
      comprehensive public health emergency interventions that include social restrictions and&#xD;
      quarantines, which is the separation and restriction of movement of people who might have&#xD;
      been exposed to the virus. While the physical risk (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory breakdown) is&#xD;
      getting the most scientific and clinical attention, this outbreak also has significant mental&#xD;
      health risks and extreme psychological fear-related responses. Psychological responses to&#xD;
      previous large-scale outbreaks, particularly to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic during&#xD;
      2014-2016, provide insight into the potential impact of rapidly spreading diseases on mental&#xD;
      health problems. During the Ebola outbreak, fear-related behaviors such as stigmatizing&#xD;
      infected survivors and ignoring medical procedures impeded public health efforts and&#xD;
      negatively affected the recovery of survivors. Anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&#xD;
      and depression were found in nearly half of the EVD survivors and their contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 outbreak exceeds the scope and magnitude of most previous disasters over the&#xD;
      last 100 years. It entails a blend of risk factors for both acute and long-term mental health&#xD;
      problems. Data that is started to emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak, suggest that front lines&#xD;
      health workers (doctors; nurses) are particularly at risk. A recent study in 1257 health care&#xD;
      workers from 34 hospitals, conducted between January 29 to February 3, 2020, revealed that&#xD;
      more than half (50.4%) of the health workers were screened positive for depression, 44.6% for&#xD;
      anxiety, and 34.0% for insomnia. Consistent with previous disaster studies a dose-response&#xD;
      relationship was found between the level of exposure and outcomes. Others may develop a moral&#xD;
      injury, profound psychological distress which results in actions, or the lack of them, which&#xD;
      violet one's moral or ethical code. Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak, its risk to&#xD;
      physical and mental health, an effective and timely response is essential to address the&#xD;
      psychosocial needs associated with the ongoing exposure to disease, death, and distress among&#xD;
      health care providers, across low and high risks areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many health care providers reluctant to seek support from friends and family, as well as&#xD;
      mental health care due to stigma and fear (e.g., &quot;it would be too embarrassing&quot;, &quot;I would be&#xD;
      seen as week&quot;). Despite enduring symptoms, they may wait months to years before they seek&#xD;
      help. Among reasons to avoid seeking mental health care, individuals report mistrust in&#xD;
      mental health providers, being seen as weak or stereotyped as &quot;crazy&quot;, and a belief that they&#xD;
      may be responsible for having mental health problems. Applying strategies to reduce stigma&#xD;
      and fear towards mental health care and improve help-seeking behavior may ameliorate impaired&#xD;
      functioning and reduce risks for long-term psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that social contact is the most effective type of intervention to&#xD;
      reduce stigma- related attitudes and to improve help-seeking behavior. Social contact&#xD;
      involves interpersonal contact with members of the stigmatized group: members of the general&#xD;
      public who meet and interact with individuals who suffer from stress, fear, depression, or&#xD;
      anxiety and seek mental health care, are likely to lessen their stigma. Corrigan has&#xD;
      identified the most important ingredients of contact-based programs: an empowered presenter&#xD;
      with lived experience who attains his/her goals (e.g., &quot;I was able to fight the&#xD;
      depression/distress that I had following the COVID-19&quot;). While both direct, in-person social&#xD;
      contact and indirect, video-based social contact have effectively improved attitudes toward&#xD;
      mental issues and care, the latter can be implemented on a larger scale, use a minimal&#xD;
      resource and easily disseminated.&#xD;
