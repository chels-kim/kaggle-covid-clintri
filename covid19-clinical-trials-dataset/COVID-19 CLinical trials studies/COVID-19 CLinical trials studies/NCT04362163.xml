  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to ensuring staff safety during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. Properly designed, formal PPE (fPPE) is in increasingly short supply, and a series&#xD;
      of improvised PPE (iPPE) designs have been widely circulated on the internet, particularly on&#xD;
      social media. Groups have started to publicise these devices through websites and the lay&#xD;
      press. Some are even using crowd-funding to finance the purchase of these systems with the&#xD;
      intention of supplying NHS workers in place of approved systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not clear what degree of testing these systems have undergone. The investigators are&#xD;
      already planning trials formally investigating the quality of seal offered by these&#xD;
      improvised systems. Currently the team are investigating a designed based on a modified&#xD;
      snorkel mask (STRIPE-1). In the current study the investigators wish to extend this&#xD;
      investigation to consider the atmosphere within the mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an important question, as modifications to the snorkel design have changed the way&#xD;
      gases mix within the system. This might increase the risk that the user will rebreathe&#xD;
      expired gases, which will dilute the amount of oxygen available to them, and increase the&#xD;
      carbon dioxide levels to which they are exposed. At extreme deviations, these might pose a&#xD;
      potential health hazard over and above the risks posed by COVID-19 exposure via a poor mask&#xD;
      seal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will therefore recruit a convenience sample of 10, and request they wear two masks&#xD;
      sequentially. These masks will comprise: a formally designed and tested commercial FFP3 mask,&#xD;
      and one design of improvised PPE, based on the snorkel design available on the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each mask will be worn for a total of 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes measurements will&#xD;
      be taken with the user at rest. In the second 20 minutes measurements will be taken while the&#xD;
      user undertakes light exercise.&#xD;
