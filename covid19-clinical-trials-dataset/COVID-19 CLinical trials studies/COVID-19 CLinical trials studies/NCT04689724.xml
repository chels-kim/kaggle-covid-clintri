  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has a retrospective and a prospective component. The retrospective component aims&#xD;
      to review data of all airway management related SAEs in COVID 19 patients (between April and&#xD;
      July 2020); hypoxemia, hypotension and cardiac arrest within 15 min of intubation. The&#xD;
      prospective component aims to assess the incidence of COVID-19 infection in Airway Management&#xD;
      Team members by means of an interview assessing their COVID19 status after participating in&#xD;
      airway management in the period outlined above. This prospective interview component is&#xD;
      starting in December 2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5-10% of all patients affected by COVID-19 develop severe respiratory distress.&#xD;
      This has already involved hundreds of people in Ontario and thousands worldwide. In this&#xD;
      situation, support with a mechanical ventilator is required. The first essential step to&#xD;
      provide this support is to insert a breathing tube in the patent's trachea (windpipe), a&#xD;
      process called 'endotracheal intubation' or more broadly, 'airway management'. While a&#xD;
      fundamental lifesaving resource, endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patents is a highly&#xD;
      specialized procedure that carries risk both to patents and attending healthcare providers as&#xD;
      follows. a) Clinicians involved in airway management for patients with coronaviruses are at&#xD;
      extremely high risk of infection due to aerosol and droplet exposure during the procedure. b)&#xD;
      Rapid administration of drugs that put the patent to sleep is usually required for prompt and&#xD;
      safe endotracheal intubation. However, in physiologically compromised patents,&#xD;
      life-threatening side-effects may occur, such as very low oxygen levels (in as many as 70% of&#xD;
      patients), low blood pressure (18-22% of patients), and cardiac arrest (2%); these can&#xD;
      significantly affect outcomes. No definitive data are presently available to accurately&#xD;
      quantify the risk posed by such procedures to healthcare professionals and patents, nor the&#xD;
      associated factors. We have developed a retrospective study reviewing data all airway&#xD;
      management related SAEs in COVID 19 patients (between April and July 2020); hypoxemia,&#xD;
      hypotension and cardiac arrest within 15 min of intubation. Additionally, we are going to&#xD;
      prospectively interview Airway Management Team members that were involved in the airway&#xD;
      management of COVID19 patients in the period described above, in order to assess whether they&#xD;
      developed signs and symptoms and/or a confirmed COVID19 infection. This prospective interview&#xD;
      component is starting in December 2020.&#xD;

        The study will use exclusively retrospective data from suspected or positive COVID-19 adult&#xD;
        patients who required intubation during their hospital stay and also record the rate of&#xD;
        infection in HCP who perform the intubation.&#xD;
