      This is a multi-center study comparing clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in&#xD;
      subjects hospitalized at Hadassah and other hospitals for PCR or serology confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      and compare the outcomes to the presence of different degrees of a cytokine storm. The&#xD;
      patients will be subdivided into a mild, moderate, and severe course according to NEWS2.&#xD;

      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 100 patients were hospitalized at Hadassah in the recent 2 months with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to summarize the clinical outcomes and their correlation to a cytokine storm at&#xD;
      Hadassah and additional hospitals and additional hospitals in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19, the name given to the clinical syndrome associated with the newly recognized virus&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 has become pandemic with a mortality estimated based on reports from China between&#xD;
      1-3% and complications among hospitalized patients leading to up to 15-25% admissions to the&#xD;
      ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical presentation includes both upper and lower respiratory tract infection, but&#xD;
      patients may also be asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnostic PCR assay was rapidly developed in Hong Kong and Berlin that accurately detects&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in samples from nose and throat swabs or sputum of hospitalized patients and is&#xD;
      used by public-health authorities around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses, the test detects a region of&#xD;
      the gene encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is unique to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all patients need hospitalization but due to the high index of infection spread, all&#xD;
      detected patients are put in isolation to prevent transmission of the infection to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of vaccines is undoubtedly an important step and several MERS vaccines were&#xD;
      already in clinical trials when word of the new outbreak spread. However, developing and&#xD;
      testing the correct viral protein that will be effective (and probably not 100% protective)&#xD;
      will take some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the meantime, anti-viral agents are tested including a combination of two human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antivirals. Lopinavir and ritonavir have been taking center&#xD;
      stage as potential therapies for COVID-19 and there are at least three registered randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial testing the lopinavir-ritonavir combination in Chinese patients infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04255017, NCT04252885 and NCT04251871) with the results of one being negative,&#xD;
      as published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2020. A handful of other HIV&#xD;
      antivirals are currently in clinical testing against SARS-CoV-2, including&#xD;
      darunavir-cobicistat. , donated by the US pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson to the&#xD;
      Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. Nucleoside analogs are being considered too and&#xD;
      Remdesivir was used to treat the first US patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, who recovered. It&#xD;
      is also in phase 3 trials in Wuhan patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, overseen by the&#xD;
      China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656). However, SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      have its own proteases, including its main protease, Mpro, and HIV antivirals design are&#xD;
      tailored specifically to block the activity of HIV proteases to avoid off-target effects on&#xD;
      human cells, which makes them less likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 proteases as well. Chloroquine&#xD;
      was recently suggested as an additional anti-viral medication. In addition, even if&#xD;
      anti-viral therapy will be found to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2, will this be the&#xD;
      treatment of choice in patients admitted to the ICU? Not necessarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot;cytokine storm&quot; calls up vivid images of an immune system gone awry and an&#xD;
      inflammatory response flaring out of control. The term has captured the attention of the&#xD;
      public and the scientific community alike and is increasingly being used in both the popular&#xD;
      media and the scientific literature. Indeed, a few publications have indicated an important&#xD;
      part of the complications in COVID-19 are related to a cytokine storm (Huang et al. Lancet&#xD;
      2020, Mehta et al. Lancet 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, there may be an underlying&#xD;
      immunological mechanism of action that is a hyper-inflammatory pathway associated with&#xD;
      increased death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-center study comparing clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in subjects&#xD;
      hospitalized at Hadassah and other hospitals for PCR or serology confirmed COVID-19 and&#xD;
      compare the outcomes to the presence of different degrees of a cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be subdivided into five severities of COVID-19 illness according to the new&#xD;
      NIH Patient Classification&#xD;
      (www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/management-of-covid-19/):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asymptomatic or Pre-symptomatic Infection: Individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           by virologic testing using a molecular diagnostic (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) or&#xD;
           antigen test, but have no symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild Illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19&#xD;
           (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of&#xD;
           breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate Illness: Individuals who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical&#xD;
           assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SpO2) ≥94% on room air at sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe Illness: Individuals who have respiratory frequency &gt;30 breaths per minute, SpO2&#xD;
           &lt;94% on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction&#xD;
           of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt;300 mmHg, or lung infiltrates &gt;50%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Critical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or&#xD;
           multiple organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytokine storm will be compared to cytokine storm in sepsis and in chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR)-T therapy, associated with Cytokine release Syndrome (CRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood results will be taken from the Hospital clinical evaluation system (MAHAR). Blood&#xD;
      leftover samples obtained from Hadassah biological blood bank, or for serological&#xD;
      confirmation or IL6 level tests (as a rationale for injecting tocilizumab, or from any&#xD;
      routine blood examination, will be used for cytokines/chemokines/hematopoietic growth&#xD;
      factors/ Complement/ DNA methylation measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of hospitalized patients, a total amount of up to 10 ml of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained and handled according to the institutional guidelines and&#xD;
      approvals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be summarized by different clinical outcomes listing the mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, minimum, median, maximum, and number of subjects for continuous data, or in tables&#xD;
      listing count and percentage for categorical and event data, as appropriate. Descriptive&#xD;
      analyses and, where appropriate, statistical testing will compare between each of the&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed, and data appendixes will be created using the&#xD;
      SAS® system (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), Version 9.4, or higher.&#xD;
