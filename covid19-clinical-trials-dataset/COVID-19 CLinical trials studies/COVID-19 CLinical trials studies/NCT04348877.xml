      1. Selection of donor according to the eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full medical history, concurrent medications, demographic data will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete clinical assessment with special emphasis on assessment of resolution of&#xD;
                symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body weight, height.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A confirmatory diagnostic test result (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab) at the time of&#xD;
                illness or serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after recovery will be&#xD;
                collected&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COVID -19 PCR test by nasopharyngeal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete blood count with differential counts&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Viral screening (HBV, HCV, HIV &amp; Syphilis): Conventional testing by&#xD;
                chemiluminescence followed by nucleic acid testing (NAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Donor's written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plasma collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Donor to be connected to microprocessor controlled plasmapheresis machine&#xD;
                containing single use disposable kit for every donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A certain amount of blood is withdrawn by pump from the patient and immediately&#xD;
                anticoagulated then centrifuged in the machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood components are separated into different layers according to the density of&#xD;
                each component.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The plasma layer is collected and diverted into the collection bag while all other&#xD;
                components are infused back to the patient, thus ending the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cycles are repeated until collecting a total of 400 ml of filtered plasma in the&#xD;
                collection bag; that is one complete therapeutic dose for one patient in need.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pathogen reduction/Viral inactivation by the Solvent/Detergent (S/D) method:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SD method is the gold standard for inactivation of enveloped viruses HBV, HCV and&#xD;
                HIV. All these viruses have a lipid outer coat enveloping the nucleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tri-N Butyl Phosphate (TNBP) acts as an organic solvent to remove lipids from the&#xD;
                membranes of pathogens.Tween-20 is a non-ionic detergent that stabilizes TNBP and&#xD;
                disrupts lipid bilayers, thus easing the extraction of lipids. Since the solvent is&#xD;
                toxic, it is removed using a sterile vegetable oil (Castor oil).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measuring remnants of TNBP:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  By chromatography in Ain Shams Toxicology Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concentration should be less than 10 ppm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Screening phase for patients selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Obtaining informed consent: Written signed and dated informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
           from each patient before being entered into the study. The investigator, or a person&#xD;
           designated by the investigator, should fully inform the subject or, if the subject is&#xD;
           unable to provide informed consent, the subject's legally acceptable representative, of&#xD;
           all pertinent aspects of the trial. This will be obtained from each subject in&#xD;
           accordance with the recommendation of the revised Declaration of Helsinki. The&#xD;
           investigator will explain the nature, purpose and risks of the study. It will be clearly&#xD;
           stated that the patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason&#xD;
           without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for&#xD;
           withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case the patient is unable to provide his/her consent the legal guardian will give&#xD;
           verbal approval on behaves of the patient and after he he/she will be well informed by&#xD;
           the study design, procedure, risk and benefits over phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If it is difficult to reach the legal guardian, emergency approval will be obtained by&#xD;
           Professional Legal Representative who will be the head authorities of the isolation&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full medical history, concurrent medications, demographic data will be obtained.&#xD;

           creatinine), Liver function tests (LFTs) (alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate&#xD;
           amino transferase (AST), total and direct bilirubin), Coagulation test; prothrombin time&#xD;
           and INR and D.dimer, HIV Ab, HCV Ab and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), COVID -19 PCR test&#xD;
