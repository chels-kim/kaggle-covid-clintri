      The present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, with the&#xD;
      approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test&#xD;
      confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim Medical Education Center in Tehran. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the two arms of the study and after completing the course of treatment&#xD;
      and collecting and analyzing the necessary information from each patient, the results of the&#xD;
      study will be published both on this site and in the form of an article in a reputable&#xD;

      Umifenovir is a component derived from indole, which has showed positive efficacy in&#xD;
      inhibition of virus-to-host cell attachment in different groups of influenza, and type C&#xD;
      hepatitis virus. Another study in 2008 also corroborated the anti-viral effect of Arbidol on&#xD;
      SARS-CoV in the cell cultures. Recent works of L. Deng and other colleagues in 11th march&#xD;
      2020 revealed that COVID-19 patients under the treatment of Arbidol Combined with LPV/r had a&#xD;
      significant clinical improvement in comparison to patients administrated with LPV/r alone. A&#xD;
      small trial has illustrated that COVID-19 infected cases who were treated by Arbidol had an&#xD;
      impressive reduction in fatality rate along with a better efficacy of treatment, in&#xD;
      comparison with those administrated with Kaletra. Nevertheless, it is still needed to do&#xD;
      further research on the effectivity of Arbidol specifically in much larger populations, so&#xD;
      there can be a more solid conclusion ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous studies, IFN-β, amongst IFN-1s, has strong antiviral activity and also&#xD;
      has an acceptable safety profile. Based on possible therapeutic effects, We decided to lead&#xD;
      An Investigation into Beneficial Effects of Interferon Beta 1a, Compared to Interferon Beta&#xD;
      1b And The Base Therapeutic Regiment in Moderate to Severe COVID-19. In a 2003 study, SARS&#xD;
      was treated with different human interferons and found that IFN-β was 5 to 10 times more&#xD;
      effective than other types of interferons and the strongest antiviral drug possible against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloroquine has been a broadly-utilized anti-malaria agent which back in 2006, had been&#xD;
      proved to be a powerful wide-spectrum antiviral. Moreover, Chloroquine has the&#xD;
      characteristics of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory by inhibiting the production of&#xD;
      TNF-α along with IL-6. In the first half of February, a study illustrated puissant inhibition&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500-mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar&#xD;
      to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. According to the news briefing of a&#xD;
      study, it was indicated that chloroquine phosphate actually outdo the control treatment in&#xD;
      inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation, improving lung imaging findings, and curtailing the&#xD;
      disease course. Another study evaluated the possible doses of CQ and HCQ to find the&#xD;
      optimized dose in treatment of COVID-19. They revealed that while within in-vitro settings&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg&#xD;
      daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day&#xD;
      divided in two separate doses, which was three-fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice&#xD;
      daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days. The new study published in 16th March, pointed&#xD;
      out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the&#xD;
      nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and&#xD;
      even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant&#xD;
      interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID-19. In spite&#xD;
      of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of&#xD;
      chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lopinavir, classified in the drug group of protease inhibitors, is utilized for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients affected prolongedly with HIV-1. The mechanism by which Lopinavir acts is&#xD;
      blocking the main protease of SARS-CoV-1, resulting in inhibition of viral replication.&#xD;
      Real-world information supporting the treatment of COVID-19 with LPV/r keep coming out.&#xD;
      Others have discovered that LPV/r has an anti-SARS-CoV effect within both in-vitro settings&#xD;
      and clinical studies. In disclosed results of Young and colleagues' research on COVID-19&#xD;
      patients in Singapore, 5 cases received LPV/r monotherapy. Among those 5 patients, 3 had&#xD;
      decrease in oxygen requirements after treatment, while the other 2 had their conditions&#xD;
      worsened to the point of respiratory failure. Other published evaluations from Korea and&#xD;
      China made up of a total of 6 patients, show reduced viral load, and clinical improvement&#xD;
      after onset of LPV/r treatment. Latterly, Cao and colleagues illustrated the results of&#xD;
      comparing twice a day use of LPV/r 400/100 mg to standard care, for treating the pneumonia&#xD;
      caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study's upshot, demonstrated no benefit regarding a&#xD;
      lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Considering the currently available data,&#xD;
      it is yet to be determined whether LPV/r could significantly affect the status of COVID-19&#xD;
      patients, either as monotherapy or in combination-therapy. Moreover, close monitoring is&#xD;
      needed during the administration of this drug, because particularly elevated levels of AST or&#xD;
      ALT suggesting the gastrointestinal complications and hepatoxicity may exclude patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 from clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, with the&#xD;
      approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test&#xD;
      confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim Medical Education Center in Tehran. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the two arms of the study and after completing the course of treatment&#xD;
      and collecting and analyzing the necessary information from each patient, the results of the&#xD;
      study will be published both on this site and in the form of an article in a reputable&#xD;
      international journal.&#xD;
