  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID 19 has become a pandemic and has led to high demand on healthcare systems. It can cause&#xD;
      a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV-2) which leads to a long hospital stay,&#xD;
      developing important functional damage and making hospital discharge difficult. Elderly,&#xD;
      obese and people with chronic diseases are more susceptible to contracting the disease, this&#xD;
      profile of patients already has a predisposition for respiratory muscle weakness and in this&#xD;
      context, after clinical stability, it is still necessary in a hospital environment to&#xD;
      approach respiratory and motor physiotherapy. to optimize the recovery of these patients.&#xD;
      Objective: Improved breathing, functionality, exercise capacity and muscle strength in&#xD;
      non-critical patients. Method: Prospective randomized clinical study where one group received&#xD;
      motor and respiratory physiotherapy and the other group performed the same therapy associated&#xD;
      with inspiratory muscle training. Results: The findings will be compared before and after the&#xD;
      approach and will be presented in graphs and tables. Statistical tests will be used&#xD;
      considering a significance level of 5%.&#xD;

      Prospective clinical study in patients with COVID-19 admitted to a non-critical unit of a&#xD;
      tertiary hospital. They were randomized into a group that received motor and respiratory&#xD;
      exercises and another group that received the same exercises associated with respiratory&#xD;
      muscle training.&#xD;
