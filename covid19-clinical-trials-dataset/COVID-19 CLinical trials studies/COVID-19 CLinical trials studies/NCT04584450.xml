  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new type of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic puts great pressure on health systems&#xD;
      around the world. A large number of people are hospitalized in intensive care units due to&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2. Common symptoms seen with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      include fever, cough, and dyspnea, as well as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome, renal failure, and even death. Many patients develop mild to moderate disease&#xD;
      without pneumonia. The respiratory condition of some patients continues to worsen gradually&#xD;
      and develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, which usually requires mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise capacity and health status of individuals who survived severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome are lower than the general population. Persistent physical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      psychosocial disorders can be seen in people who have survived acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the clinical and radiological heterogeneity of COVID-19, it is important to have a&#xD;
      simple tool for the disease to monitor the course of symptoms and the impact of symptoms on&#xD;
      patients' functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Klok FA et al. developed the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale (PCFS). PCFS can be&#xD;
      evaluated for functional sequelae after discharge from the hospital, at 4 and 8 weeks after&#xD;
      discharge, to directly monitor recovery, and at 6 months. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the validity and reliability of PCFS in Turkish population. Research permission&#xD;
      to investigate the validity and reliability of PCFS in the Turkish population was obtained&#xD;
      from the developer of the PCFS.&#xD;

    <description>It has been proposed as a tool to measure the full spectrum of functional outcomes following COVID-19. Post-COVID-19 Functional Status scale was reported to be used to monitor functional status. Scoring varies between 0-4. The expression 0 in PCFS indicates that there is no functional limitation. Grade 4 describes patients with severe functional limitations that require assistance with activities of daily living.</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea will be assessed by the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale. Individuals are asked to choose the expression that best describes their dyspnea level. Scoring in MMRC varies between 0-4 points. &quot;0 points&quot; means that there is no dyspnea; &quot;4 points&quot; indicates that there is a perception of dyspnea during basic daily life activities such as dressing.</description>

    <description>The Barthel index was developed by Mahoney and Barthel in 1965. It is an index that is simple, understandable and includes all parameters of daily life activities. Its Turkish validity and reliability were made by Küçükdeveci et al. It consists of 10 sub-headings: eating, bathing, self-care, dressing, bladder control, bowel control, toilet use, chair / bed transfer, mobility, and use of stairs. Its scoring ranges from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the structural validity of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The London Chest Activities of Daily Living Scale, developed by Garrod et al., will be used to evaluate the structural validity of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale. This questionnaire consists of 15 items and four components: personal care (4 items), housework (6 items), physical (2 items) and leisure (3 items). Each item is scored between 0 and 5. High scores show that the limitation in daily living activities is greater. The total score can reach 75 at most. The validity and reliability study of the questionnaire for the Turkish population has been conducted.</description>
