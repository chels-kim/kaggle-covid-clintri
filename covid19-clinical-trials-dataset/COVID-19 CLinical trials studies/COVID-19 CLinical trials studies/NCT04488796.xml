  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In COVID-19 times, there has been a large increase in number of people working from home;&#xD;
      with limited places to go, an abrupt change to people's lives and lack of knowledge about the&#xD;
      dangers of sedentary behaviour (SB), it is important to help workers develop and effortlessly&#xD;
      incorporate healthy movement routines to optimize daily productivity and health. The combined&#xD;
      lack of knowledge on literature on SB profiles of full time, home-based workers, effects of&#xD;
      framing of SB reduction strategies, and strategy preference uncertainty makes for a novel&#xD;
      study. This will be a 4-week intervention that looks at whether telling a full time,&#xD;
      home-based office worker to do pre-selected strategies using different framing structures to&#xD;
      break up their sedentary behaviour (SB) (i.e. sitting) will change their SB profiles.&#xD;
      Investigators are looking to see whether having the choice (or not) to choose strategies in&#xD;
      an unfamiliar health related selection (preference uncertainty) will create greater changes&#xD;
      in SBs. As well, the researchers are incorporating behavioural economics' by altering choice&#xD;
      structure in relation to behaviour change and program engagement. Workers' work-related SB&#xD;
      will be measured by a device at baseline and on the last week of the intervention. Workers&#xD;
      will be provided with an SB educational video to increase knowledge and motivation for&#xD;
      change. Any SB changes in relation to productivity, mental wellness, behaviour intentions&#xD;
      etc. will also be measured.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regardless of group assignment, participants will receive the same three-minute educational&#xD;
      video at the beginning (week 1) and halfway through (week 3) the intervention. Each group&#xD;
      will also receive two weekly sedentary behaviour reduction strategies that align with the&#xD;
      concept of &quot;moving more often&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be initially randomized into the no choice strategy assignment or choice of&#xD;
      strategy assignment groups, then immediately randomized into one of three choice structure&#xD;
      conditions. The strategy assignment groups (no choice and choice) will receive two&#xD;
      individually randomized (out of the ten &quot;move more&quot; strategies (see Table 2) each week. The&#xD;
      two assigned strategies will be randomized to the participant each week; therefore,&#xD;
      strategies may or may not change week to week. When presented with the two strategies, the&#xD;
      Qualtrics program will state: &quot;These will be your two move more strategies (click next to&#xD;
      acknowledge you have seen your strategies)&quot;, followed by two multiple choice styled&#xD;
      strategies. Regardless of if the person decides to click the boxes beside the strategies or&#xD;
      clicks &quot;next&quot;, the strategies will be inserted into the one of the three choice structure&#xD;
      statements. Those randomized into the &quot;choice of strategy assignment&quot; group will be asked in&#xD;
      their baseline questionnaire whether or not they: &quot;prefer to choose and manage their own&#xD;
      sitting reduction strategies from a list of expert recommended strategies OR prefer to be&#xD;
      assigned with two strategies every week from a list of expert recommended strategies&quot;. Those&#xD;
      opting to be assigned strategies (&quot;Choice Strategy Assignment&quot; group) will be assigned two&#xD;
      random strategies, just like the &quot;No Choice Strategy Assignment&quot; group; however, they remain&#xD;
      different from the &quot;No Choice Strategy Assignment&quot; group because they were given and chose&#xD;
      the option to be given strategies. Those selecting to choose and manage their own strategies&#xD;
      &quot;Choice Strategy Self-Selection&quot; group will be presented the same ten strategies each week,&#xD;
      in random order, and will have the option to choose two strategies. The strategies can remain&#xD;
      the same or change from week to week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three choice structure&#xD;
      conditions: opt-in, Active Choice or Enhanced Active Choice. All three messages will contain&#xD;
      the following introduction: &quot;As you now know, breaking up your sitting every 45 minutes with&#xD;
      2-3 minutes of light activity can significantly reduce negative health risks associated with&#xD;
      prolonged sitting.&quot; This message will end with one of the three choice structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the opt-in condition they will be asked to &quot;Place a check in the box [agree] if you will&#xD;
      breakup your sitting throughout your work hours by [strategy] this week&quot;. The strategy&#xD;
      statement is followed up by; OR, click the next button at the bottom.&quot; Within the opt-in&#xD;
      condition, the default is to not participate (by clicking &quot;next&quot;); participants are not&#xD;
      required to explicitly state they do not want to do the strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Active choice condition, participants will be required to either, &quot;Place a check in&#xD;
      one box: I will break up my sitting throughout my work hours by [strategy] this week or, I&#xD;
      will not break up my sitting throughout my work hours by [strategy] this week&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Enhanced Active Choice condition, participants will to required to choose between two&#xD;
      alternatives: &quot;I will break up my sitting throughout my work hours this week by [strategy] to&#xD;
      reduce my risk of diabetes, mental health issues and other detrimental health outcomes and I&#xD;
      want to win the eGiftcard or, I will not break up my sitting time during my work hours by&#xD;
      [strategy] this week even if it means I increase my risk of developing diabetes, mental&#xD;
      health issues and other detrimental health outcomes and I don't care about winning an&#xD;
      eGiftcard&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assigned or self-selected strategies (depending initial group assignment) will be sent in a&#xD;
      reminder email on the Wednesday morning of each week and participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      self-report their sedentary behaviour patterns on the Friday of each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An &quot;interested&quot; participant will email research personal with their initial &quot;interest&quot; in&#xD;
      which the research personnel will respond by sending them the baseline questionnaire along&#xD;
      with their unique ID code to access it in SoSci. Participants baseline questionnaires will be&#xD;
      randomized to be either, a) assignment of choice strategies or b) choice of assignment vs&#xD;
      self-management of choice strategies. Those assigned to the &quot;Choice of Assigned Strategies&quot;&#xD;
      condition will have an additional question presenting them with the option of having&#xD;
      strategies assigned to them or the option to choose and manage their own strategies. The LOI&#xD;
      will be the first page of the questionnaire for them to review, and at the bottom will state,&#xD;
      &quot;Clicking on the &quot;agree&quot; button below indicates that you have read the above information, you&#xD;
      voluntarily agree to participate and you are at least 18 years of age. If you do not wish to&#xD;
      participate in the research study, please decline participation by clicking on the &quot;disagree&quot;&#xD;
      button and simply exit the browser.&quot; Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire,&#xD;
      participants will be emailed a PDF version of the LOI/informed consent, and will be asked to&#xD;
      sign (digitally) the form and email it back to research personnel. Once consent is received,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into one of 3 choice structure conditions (Opt-in Choice OR&#xD;
      Active Choice OR Enhanced Active Choice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activPAL will be sent by courier (i.e. FedEx) and participants will receive another email&#xD;
      with detailed instructions of how to apply the device [i.e. applied to the mid-thigh using&#xD;
      Tegaderm (3M)] along with how to contact investigators upon any issues with application.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to apply the device on Sunday evening (if possible) and to&#xD;
      wear the device all day for a period of 5 working days (Monday to Friday). Once participants&#xD;
      complete the device measured baseline assessment, they will place the device back in the&#xD;
      package it came in, and using pre-paid postage, the device will be picked up (via courier)&#xD;
      and they will then be randomized into one of the three experimental conditions preceding the&#xD;
      intervention period. Strategies will be pre-randomized for each condition from the longlist&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Week 1. On day one of the intervention (Monday), participants will receive an&#xD;
      email containing, 1) a link to watch a 3-minute whiteboard-styled educational video about&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour (i.e. health consequences, benefits of breaking up or reducing sedentary&#xD;
      behaviour, sedentary behaviour in relation to productivity and mood etc.) and 2) another link&#xD;
      that will lead them to a short questionnaire assessing knowledge on sedentary behaviour&#xD;
      (fidelity check) as well as their behavioural strategies (different based on the condition&#xD;
      assignment; as described earlier). Wednesday morning, they will receive an email reminding&#xD;
      them of their strategies. On the last day of the same workweek (Friday), participants will be&#xD;
      prompted (via email) with a link (Soci) to self-report their sitting habits (i.e. break&#xD;
      frequency and break duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Week 2. On the Monday of week 2, participants will again be assigned or asked to&#xD;
      choose their strategies via email (depending on group allocation) for that week and will&#xD;
      again receive an email Wednesday morning reminding them of their chosen/assigned strategies.&#xD;
      They will again be asked to self-report their sitting habits (via link sent through email)&#xD;
      (i.e. break frequency and break duration) on the last day of the week (Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Week 3. On the Monday of Week 3, strategies will reset as earlier described for&#xD;
      each condition. However, for this week, the participants will be reminded of the video they&#xD;
      watched at the beginning of the intervention and be asked to re-watch the same video. In line&#xD;
      with the same protocol described in the earlier weeks, a reminder email will be sent on&#xD;
      Wednesday morning and self-reported sitting habits will be measured at the end of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Week 4. Week four of the intervention will be the final week. Again, strategies&#xD;
      will reset for all conditions as previously described. Participants again, will wear the&#xD;
      activPAL4's (delivered via FedEx) for a total of five days (Monday to Friday). This will&#xD;
      serve as the follow-up objectively (device) measured sedentary behaviour measurement. The&#xD;
      participants will receive the same reminder email as previous weeks. This last week, however,&#xD;
      the Friday questionnaire will include all secondary outcomes that were initially assessed at&#xD;
      baseline along with a short exit survey asking about participant satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up. Follow-up will occur two weeks post-intervention. Participants will recomplete all&#xD;
      secondary outcomes that were initially assessed at baseline (with exception to the activPAL&#xD;
      measurements).&#xD;

    <description>Questions regarding work productivity, concentration and focus will be measured with questions adapted from The Health and Work Questionnaire (HWQ). The HWQ is a multidimensional tool used to measure various aspects of productivity. The HWQ consists of 24 questions, several items being multi-part questions with internal consistency scores ranging from alpha = 0.72 to 0.96. The questions are designed to assess work quality, quantity, and efficiency, as well as impatience, concentration/focus, work satisfaction and non-work satisfaction. For the current study, 15 items were chosen from this questionnaire that were relevant to &quot;home-based&quot; office workers. Items will be assessed with a ten-point response scale, tailored to each question (e.g., &quot;my worst ever&quot; to &quot;my best ever&quot;).</description>

    <description>The validated three-item modified Occupational Sitting and Physical activity questionnaire (OSPAQ). The OSPAQ is a brief instrument reported to have excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.73-0.90), moderate criterion validity for time spent sitting and standing (r = 0.65 and 0.49, respectively), and lower validity for time spent walking (r = 0.29). At each assessment period (baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4 and follow-up), participants will be asked to record both the number of days they were at work and total number of hours they worked in the last 7 days. Participants will then be asked to record a percentage of time spent sitting, standing, and moving (i.e. walking) (cumulative total of 100%) during work hours on a typical workday in the last 7 days.</description>
