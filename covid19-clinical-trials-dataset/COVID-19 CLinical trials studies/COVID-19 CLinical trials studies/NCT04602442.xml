  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus is an acute viral disease with prevailing upper respiratory tract infections&#xD;
      caused by the RNA-containing virus of the genus Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family.&#xD;
      Most patients with severe COVID-19 develop pneumonia in the first week of the disease. As the&#xD;
      infection progresses, the infiltration increases, and the affected areas increases. Excessive&#xD;
      and uncontrolled immune system response with rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm plays&#xD;
      the main role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to available data, exosomes can regulate inflammation and regenerative processes&#xD;
      due to the change in the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and switch the immune&#xD;
      cell to regenerative secretome. Inhalation of exosomes may reduce inflammation and damage to&#xD;
      the lung tissue and stimulate the regenerative processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has been developed based on the literature, information about the ongoing tests&#xD;
      NCT04276987 (A Pilot Clinical Study on Inhalation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exosomes Treating&#xD;
      Severe Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia) and NCT04384445 (Organicell Flow for Patients With&#xD;
      COVID-19), Patent No 271036826 of 2019. &quot;A method for obtaining and concentrating&#xD;
      microRNA-containing exosomal multi-potent mesenchymal-stromal cells for use in cosmetic and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical products to stimulate regenerative processes and slow down aging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This&#xD;
      new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December&#xD;
      2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries worldwide. Globally, as of 1:09 pm&#xD;
      CEST, 27 July 2020, there have been 16 096 741 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 646 384&#xD;
      deaths, reported to WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main and rapidly achievable target of SARS-CoV-2 is lung type II alveolar cells (AT2),&#xD;
      which determines the development of diffuse alveolar damage. In the pathogenesis of ARDS due&#xD;
      to COVID-19, the main role is played by an over-response of the immune system with rapidly&#xD;
      developing severe life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm). Cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome threatens the emergence and progression of ARDS. The key components of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of ARDS also include disruption of cell cytotoxicity mechanisms, excessive&#xD;
      activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and macrophages with a massive release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (FNO-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), granulocytic colony-stimulating factor,&#xD;
      monocytic chemoattractive protein 1), and inflammatory markers (CRP, serum ferritin),&#xD;
      infiltration of internal organs and tissues by activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages,&#xD;
      resulting in a hyperinflammatory reaction. Such severe lesions can lead to death or severe&#xD;
      lung damage, including long rehabilitation after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may significantly&#xD;
      reduce lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung&#xD;
      injury. Many researchers connect the anti-inflammatory effect of MSC with their secretome&#xD;
      which includes MSC derived exosomes. It is highly likely that MSC exosomes have the same&#xD;
      therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves. Moreover, exosomes show a&#xD;
      strong effect of regenerative stimulation on different wounds so the regenerative effect can&#xD;
      be extended on patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of&#xD;
      the exosomes in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus&#xD;
      pneumonia (NCP).&#xD;
