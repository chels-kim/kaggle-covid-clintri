    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, dose-response study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of UB 612 in 2 age groups, adults 18 to 59 and ≥60&#xD;
      years of age with or without comorbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2/3 trial will enroll a total of 7320 male and female subjects randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner to receive either UB-612 or placebo. Assignment will be stratified by age&#xD;
      (18 to 59 years and ≥60 years) and by presence/absence of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive 2 doses of the study vaccine, separated by 28 days, as an&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 and Phase 3 will start simultaneously; Phase 2 will enroll all Strata #1 to #4; Phase&#xD;
      3 will enroll Stratum #1 until the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has reviewed Phase&#xD;
      2 data through Day 43 and endorsed enrolment of Strata #2 to #4. All subjects in Phase 2 and&#xD;
      Phase 3 will be followed for safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2/3 study also contains a Safety and Immunogenicity Cohort (N=1300) consisting of&#xD;
      1000 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative subjects (320 subjects enrolled in Phase 2 and 680 subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase 3) and 300 SARS-CoV-2 seropositive subjects enrolled in Phase 3.&#xD;
