      Passive immunization involves the administration of antibodies against a given agent to a&#xD;
      susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to&#xD;
      that agent. A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when&#xD;
      used for prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most&#xD;
      effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms&#xD;

      Passive immunization involves the administration of antibodies against a given agent to a&#xD;
      susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to&#xD;
      that agent. A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when&#xD;
      used for prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most&#xD;
      effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal&#xD;
      variation in efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by&#xD;
      neutralizing the initial inoculums, which is likely to be much smaller than that of&#xD;
      established disease . As an example, passive antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was&#xD;
      most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms, and there was no&#xD;
      benefit if antibody administration was delayed past the third day of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic and prophylactic significance was explored in influenza and measles . Transfusion&#xD;
      of immune plasma is a standard treatment modality for various viral hemorrhagic fevers . Its&#xD;
      efficacy in treating Ebola Virus Disease is also well established . Studies have reported&#xD;
      reduction viral load in patients with H1N1 influenza .Efficacy of convalescent plasma has&#xD;
      been anecdotally reported in SARS-CoV-2 infections .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest study involved the treatment of 80 patients with SARS in Hong Kong. Patients&#xD;
      treated before day 14 had improved prognosis defined by discharge from hospital before day&#xD;
      22, consistent with the notion that earlier administration is more likely to be effective .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody&#xD;
      therapy mediated protection is viral neutralization. However, other mechanisms may be&#xD;
      possible, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. The only&#xD;
      antibody type that is currently available for immediate use SARS-CoV-2 is that found in human&#xD;
      convalescent sera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China for SARS-CoV-2 disease, it has been found that the convalescent plasma therapy is&#xD;
      effective for patients with a disease course exceeding three weeks and whose virus nucleic&#xD;
      acid tests continuously to show positive from respiratory tracts specimen. It can speed up&#xD;
      virus clearance, increase the numbers of the plasma lymphocytes and NK cells, reduce the&#xD;
      level of plasma lactic acid, and improve renal functions.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients tested positive in respiratory tract test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The COVID-19 patients who are not severe or critically ill, but in a state of immunity&#xD;
             suppression;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  or have low CT values in the virus nucleic acid testing but with a rapid disease&#xD;
             progression in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe or immediately life-threatening COVID-19, for example,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe disease is defined as one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  shortness of breath (dyspnea),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt; 300,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  lung infiltrates &gt; 50% within 24 to 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 3 to 21 days from onset of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Life-threatening disease is defined as one or more of the following: respiratory failure,&#xD;
        septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction or failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Critically ill COVID-19 patients will not considered suitable for being transfusion as&#xD;
        inflammatory pathway is already set in, so antibodies will not make that much of&#xD;
        difference.&#xD;
