    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of a novel therapeutic agent, Novaferon, in hospitalized adult&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is comprised of two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: This is a blinded safety lead-in comprising two arms. 40 patients will be&#xD;
           randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either Novaferon or matched placebo via a&#xD;
           commercial nebulizer, plus Standard of Care (SOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: This is the main portion of the study, which comprises two arms. Up to 874&#xD;
           patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either Novaferon or matched&#xD;
           placebo via a commercial nebulizer, plus SOC&#xD;
