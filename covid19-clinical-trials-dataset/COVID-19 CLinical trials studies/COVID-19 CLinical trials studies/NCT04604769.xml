      Well-being of caregivers and stress management in intensive care units are essential keys to&#xD;
      an adequate quality of care, especially during the anxious context of coronavirus pandemic.&#xD;
      Taking care of numerous patients, the increasing work and mental charges, facing death, the&#xD;
      need of material and changes in work organization are all elements that can influence stress&#xD;
      among medical workers. Considering real causes of stress and what are the needs of the&#xD;
      medical team is fundamental for developing concrete actions to ease the workloads. A few&#xD;
      studies were conducted in China on psychological distress of medical staff during COVID-19.&#xD;
      According to these few studies about psychological distress in ICU, investigators think that&#xD;
      stress scores during COVID-19 could be increased among nurses during pandemic. The second&#xD;
      hypothesis is that causes of stress would be not so different from normal care but could be&#xD;
      amplified by the actual situation. One point to take into consideration is that most of the&#xD;
      studies were conducted in China and medical policy and hospital organization are different in&#xD;
      Belgium. The objective of the study is to compare psychological distress and needs of nurses&#xD;
      in ICU before and during coronavirus pandemic.&#xD;
