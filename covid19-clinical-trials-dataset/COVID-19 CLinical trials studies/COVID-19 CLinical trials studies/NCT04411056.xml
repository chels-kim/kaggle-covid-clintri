  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who will be having surgery and will have a breathing tube placed&#xD;
      during intubation. The purpose of the research is to study the time it takes to use a barrier&#xD;
      box for placement of a breathing tube. A barrier box is a clear box that sits over the head&#xD;
      and shoulders of a patient as a breathing tube is placed. The box is used to protect the&#xD;
      healthcare provider's exposure to coronavirus in patients who have COVID-19. The study will&#xD;
      not include patients who test positive for COVID-19 or who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
      The researchers want to learn how long it takes to use the barrier box before it is used&#xD;
      routinely in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have two groups of 39 patients in each group. Some patients will have a&#xD;
      barrier box and some patients will not have a barrier box. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the barrier box or no barrier box group. The study will measure the time it takes to place&#xD;
      the breathing tube.&#xD;
