      Background: Patients with COVID-19 have a range of clinical spectrum from asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection, mild illness, moderate infection requiring supplemental oxygen and severe&#xD;
      infection requiring intensive care support. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy and&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may offer respiratory support to patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure if conventional oxygen therapy (COT) fails&#xD;
      to maintain satisfactory oxygenation but whether these respiratory therapies would lead to&#xD;
      airborne viral transmission is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This study examines whether SARS-2 virus can be detected in small particles in the&#xD;
      hospital isolation rooms in patients who receive a) HFNC, b) NIV via oronasal masks and c)&#xD;
      conventional nasal cannula for respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A field test to be performed at the Prince of Wales hospital ward 12C single bed&#xD;
      isolation room with 12 air changes/hr on patients (n=5 for each category of respiratory&#xD;
      therapy) with confirmed COVID-19 who require treatment for respiratory failure with a) HFNC&#xD;
      up to 60L/min, b) NIV via oronasal masks and c) conventional nasal cannula up to 5L/min of&#xD;
      oxygen. While the patient is on respiratory support, we would position 3 stationary devices&#xD;
      in the isolation room (one next to each side of the bed and another at the end of the bed) of&#xD;
      the patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and sample the air for four hours&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results &amp; implications: If air sampling RTPCR and viral culture is positive, this would&#xD;
      objectively confirm that HFNC and NIV require airborne precaution by healthcare workers&#xD;
      during application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel coronavirus, subsequently named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged as the cause of atypical&#xD;
      pneumonia linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019. Since then, SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      related-disease (named COVID-19 by the WHO), has spread internationally to the scale of a&#xD;
      global pandemic. Although most patients present with mild respiratory symptoms, some have&#xD;
      severe pneumonia and a small proportion may become critically ill. Severe COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      often progresses to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high fractional&#xD;
      concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and consideration for non-invasive ventilation (NIV)&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has emerged as a non-invasive strategy improving oxygenation&#xD;
      and carbon dioxide clearance by, in comparisons to other NIV strategies, better matching&#xD;
      patients' inspiratory demands by delivering up to 60 L/min of gas flow and FiO2 up to 1.0. A&#xD;
      systematic review found low certainty evidence suggesting benefit of HFNC in reducing the&#xD;
      need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or escalation of oxygen therapy compared to&#xD;
      conventional oxygen therapy (COT), and moderate certainty evidence suggesting no large&#xD;
      difference in mortality. HFNC may reduce the need for IMV and associated complications such&#xD;
      as ventilator-associated pneumonias, and alleviate the strain on healthcare systems during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 spreads predominantly through respiratory droplets and fomites. There is concern,&#xD;
      however, that airborne transmission may occur during respiratory procedures that generate&#xD;
      aerosols. Airborne transmission involves smaller particles, typically &lt;5μm in diameter, which&#xD;
      may remain suspended in the air for extended periods of time, transmitted over distances&#xD;
      greater than 1m, and inhaled into the lower airways. Reduction of respiratory particles to &lt;5&#xD;
      µm involves evaporation of larger droplets and their contained organisms, and rehydration&#xD;
      after deposition into the airway; therefore, airborne transmission is organism-specific, and&#xD;
      requires the organism to survive a process of desiccation and aerosolization in sufficient&#xD;
      numbers to cause infection. SARS-CoV2 has been shown to survive in air for 3 hrs after&#xD;
      deliberate aerolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) COVID-19 guidelines provide a weak recommendation for the&#xD;
      preferential use of HFNC over other NIV strategies in patients refractory to COT for type 1&#xD;
      respiratory failure.10 The use of high flow rates raises concerns that HFNC may cause&#xD;
      aerosolization of infectious particles. Using a human patient simulator and smoke particles&#xD;
      as markers visualized by a laser light sheet, HFNC with humidification may disperse exhaled&#xD;
      air up to 172mm upward and 620mm laterally when the nasal cannula is clipped on properly and&#xD;
      loosely respectively. Using the same methodology, NIV via the old generation oronasal masks&#xD;
      could disperse exhaled air diffusely but there is limited exhaled air dispersion through the&#xD;
      new generation masks with better design of the exhalation ports. In contrast, exhaled air&#xD;
      dispersion from conventional nasal cannula delivering oxygen at 5L/min without humidification&#xD;
      may disperse exhaled air to 1m towards the end of the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of field data on the use of these respiratory therapies in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      complicated by respiratory failure, the role of fine particle aerosols in transmission of&#xD;
      viral infection during application of HFNC and NIV is unknown. Because of uncertainty around&#xD;
      the potential for aerosolization, the WHO has recommended that HFNC, NIV, including bubble&#xD;
      CPAP, should be used with airborne precautions until further evaluation of safety can be&#xD;
      completed. To alleviate concern by the healthcare workers in delivering these respiratory&#xD;
      therapies to patients with COVID-19 complicated by respiratory failure, it is important to&#xD;
      conduct a field test using viral samplers in patients with COVID-19 who require these&#xD;
      therapies for respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives This study aims to detect whether SARS-2 virus can be detected in small&#xD;
      particles in the hospital isolation rooms in patients who receive a) HFNC up to 60L/min, b)&#xD;
      NIV via oronasal masks and c) conventional nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and indications of respiratory therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a field test to be performed at the Prince of Wales hospital ward 12C single bed&#xD;
      isolation room with 12 air changes per hr on patients (n=5 for each category of respiratory&#xD;
      therapy) with confirmed COVID-19 who require treatment for respiratory failure with a) HFNC&#xD;
      up to 60L/min, b) NIV via oronasal masks and c) conventional nasal cannula up to 5L/min of&#xD;
      oxygen. Five patients in each treatment category will be recruited as the majority (80%) of&#xD;
      confirmed cases in HK have been mild without respiratory failure. For example, among the 974&#xD;
      cases as of 10 April 2020, 23 and 25 patients respectively have ever required supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen at least 3L/min on the isolation wards and ICU support (for IMV, ECMO or shock).&#xD;
      Different respiratory therapy will be decided by the physician on duty for patients with&#xD;
      different degree of respiratory failure. In general, conventional nasal cannula is used for&#xD;
      mild respiratory failure while HFNC is required to those who remain hypoxic. NIV is usually&#xD;
      applied for those with type 2 respiratory failure. In adults with COVID-19, the SSC&#xD;
      Guidelines suggest starting supplemental oxygen if the peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2) is&#xD;
      &lt; 92% (weak recommendation, low quality evidence), and recommend starting supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      if SpO2 is &lt; 90% (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence) to achieve SpO2 not&#xD;
      higher than 96%. For adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite&#xD;
      COT, the SSC guidelines suggest using HFNC over NIV (weak recommendation, low quality&#xD;
      evidence). In adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, if HFNC is not&#xD;
      available and there is no urgent indication for endotracheal intubation, the SSC guidelines&#xD;
      suggest a trial of NIV with close monitoring and short-interval assessment for worsening of&#xD;
      respiratory failure (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory therapy: COT with nasal cannula 1-5L/min of oxygen will be used to maintain SpO2&#xD;
      around 95% for patients with type 1 respiratory failure. If this is not achievable despite&#xD;
      5L/min of oxygen, HFNC at 50-60L/min with humidification at 37C (Airvo 2, Fisher &amp; Paykel,&#xD;
      Auckland, New Zealand) will be applied while NIV (Respironics V60) via oronasal mask&#xD;
      (Quattro, ResMed) will be reserved for patients with type 2 respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air samplings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each air sampling period while the patient is on respiratory support, we would position 3&#xD;
      stationary devices in the isolation room (one next to each side of the bed and another at the&#xD;
      end of the bed) of the patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and sample the air for four&#xD;
      hours continuously. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) device&#xD;
      consists of a three-stage cyclone air samplers set at height 1.5m and 1.0m, which represent&#xD;
      the mouth heights of a standing and sitting adult respectively and a meter that records&#xD;
      temperature and relative humidity (at height 1.3m) every four minutes. The NIOSH samplers are&#xD;
      located around the sampling bed ('Centre'), on the side of the sampling bed ('Side'), or&#xD;
      relocated during the period of the sampling. The NIOSH samplers are placed in the range of&#xD;
      0.5-1m (when placed next to the sampling bed) to 2-2.5m from the patient's head when placed&#xD;
      at the end of the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air is collected at 3.5L/minute into three size fractions: &gt;4μm (collected in a 15ml tube),&#xD;
      1-4μm (1.5ml tube) and &lt;1μm (by a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter with 3.0μm&#xD;
      pore size). For five sampling runs, an extra air sampler (set at height 0.8m) unconnected to&#xD;
      a pump will be added to the device as a negative control. After each collection, the 15ml and&#xD;
      1.5ml tubes are detached and 1 ml of viral transport medium (VTM) are added. The filter is&#xD;
      removed and immersed in 1mL of VTM inside a 5ml tube. All the tubes are then transported to&#xD;
      the laboratory at 4°C, vortexed, and the VTM is aliquoted and stored at -80°C for subsequent&#xD;
      laboratory analysis by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). New sampling&#xD;
      tubes and filters are used and the samplers and other equipment are disinfected between uses.&#xD;
      The tripod, air tubing, sound-proof box and the meter are disinfected with Med-Clean (M&amp;W&#xD;
      International Ltd., Hong Kong), the NIOSH air samplers with 1% Virkon and 2% Citranox&#xD;
      (Alconox Inc, NY, USA), and the filter cassettes are autoclaved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral loads:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral loads will be measured from the patient's upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      flocked swab and throat swab) on admission and serially second daily during hospitalization&#xD;
      by means of quantitative RT-PCR assay with primers and probes targeting the N and Orf1b genes&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Dependent variables are identified as the nasopharyngeal flocked swab&#xD;
      and throat swab viral load (log10 copies/mL) and detection of viral RNA from one or more&#xD;
      participant air samples (positive) vs. all negative air samples. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney,&#xD;
      Kruskal Wallis tests and Spearman correlation are used to assess the presence of&#xD;
      statistically significant correlations or distributions between independent variables and the&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract swab viral load, while the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact&#xD;
      tests are used for air samples. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS University&#xD;
      Edition (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;
