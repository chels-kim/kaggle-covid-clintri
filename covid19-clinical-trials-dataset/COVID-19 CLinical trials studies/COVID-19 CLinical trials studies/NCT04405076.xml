&#xD;
          1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older at the time of consent (Screening Visit, Day&#xD;
             0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Understands and agrees to comply with the study procedures and provides written&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. According to the assessment of the investigator, is in good general health and can&#xD;
             comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 kilograms/meter (kg/m)^2 to 30 kg/m^2 (inclusive) at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participants of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
             Nonchildbearing potential is defined as surgically sterile (history of bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;
             amenorrhea for ≥12 consecutive months prior to Screening (Day 0) without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause). A follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be measured&#xD;
             at the discretion of the investigator to confirm postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the&#xD;
             participant fulfills all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a negative pregnancy test at Screening (Day 0) and on the day of the first&#xD;
                  injection (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that&#xD;
                  could result in pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first injection (Day&#xD;
                  1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has agreed to continue adequate contraception through 3 months following the&#xD;
                  second injection (Day 29).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is not currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of a Food and&#xD;
             Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive method in accordance with the product&#xD;
             label. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction&#xD;
                  with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Sterilization of a female participant's monogamous male partner prior to entry&#xD;
                  into the study Note: periodic abstinence (for example, calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
                  of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male participants engaging in activity that could result in pregnancy of sexual&#xD;
             partners must agree to practice adequate contraception from the time of the first&#xD;
             injection and through 3 months after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate contraception for male participants is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monogamous relationship with a female partner using an intrauterine device or hormonal&#xD;
             contraception (described above)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of barrier methods and spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of surgical sterilization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants with partners who have become pregnant prior to Screening are&#xD;
