  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Expansion Control (MAGEC) growth rods are used in the surgical treatment of children&#xD;
      with scoliosis; the primary constituent metal alloy in these is titanium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since June 2019, the manufacturer has released two Urgent Field Safety Notices (FSN) relating&#xD;
      to known issues with the function of the rods that increase the risk of early failure and&#xD;
      unplanned revisions. The UK MHRA has issued two similar Medical Device Alerts (MDA) with the&#xD;
      most recent MDA issued on 1st April 2020, stating that (1) MAGEC rods must not be implanted&#xD;
      in the UK until further notice and (2) all patients already implanted with this device should&#xD;
      be followed up as soon as is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of writing, hospitals across the world are facing incredible challenges in&#xD;
      dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to this, virtually all planned clinic visits for&#xD;
      MAGEC rod patients and X-ray appointments have been postponed to help reduce the risk of the&#xD;
      virus spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent retrieval studies have shown that mechanical wear and corrosion of these rods is&#xD;
      common, with a risk that the debris generated is released into surrounding tissue. This wear&#xD;
      and corrosion is thought to be the primary cause of implant failures and the underlying&#xD;
      implant factors leading to the issuing of FSNs and MDAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst titanium is known to be highly biocompatible, the baseline and toxic levels of this&#xD;
      alloy in biological fluids are poorly understood. Additionally, a better understanding of&#xD;
      blood titanium levels in patients with MAGEC rods may enable this to become a biomarker of&#xD;
      wear and corrosion of the rods. This may help surgeons identify earlier those patients who&#xD;
      may develop implant related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the current COVID-19 environment, a blood test to measure titanium levels may&#xD;
      be one of the most suitable ways in which to continue patient monitoring (and identify those&#xD;
      at greatest risk of implant related issues), in the absence of regular clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work from the RNOH involved a similar study investigating patients with titanium hip&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
