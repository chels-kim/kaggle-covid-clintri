  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2-related severe ARDS is high despite treatment with&#xD;
      antivirals, glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, and ventilation. Preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      evidence indicate that MSCs migrate to the lung and respond to the pro-inflammatory lung&#xD;
      environment by releasing anti-inflammatory factors reducing the proliferation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines while modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages to promote&#xD;
      resolution of inflammation. Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in&#xD;
      management of COVID-19 induced ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared&#xD;
      to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      due to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of MSCs on inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized (1:1 ratio), double blind, parallel design, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial. Randomization will be stratified by clinical center and by moderate versus severe&#xD;
      ARDS. The study is designed to have three interim analyses for stopping accrual early for&#xD;
      efficacy and futility when 30%, 45% and 60% of the 300 patients have reached the primary&#xD;
      endpoint using Bayesian predictive probabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to intravenous infusion of MSCs&#xD;
      (remestemcel-L) plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care for the treatment&#xD;
      of COVID-19 related ARDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 2x10^6 MSC/kg of body weight plus standard of care, administered twice during&#xD;
           the first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1&#xD;
           day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Placebo (Plasma-Lyte) plus standard of care, administered twice during the&#xD;
           first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1 day)&#xD;
           (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs and placebo will initially be administered intravenously in the dose defined above at&#xD;
      randomization. The rate of infusion may be tailored to the patient's respiratory status and&#xD;
      fluid status, but the duration of infusion should not exceed 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 90 days post randomization, with assessment of pulmonary&#xD;
      symptoms at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
