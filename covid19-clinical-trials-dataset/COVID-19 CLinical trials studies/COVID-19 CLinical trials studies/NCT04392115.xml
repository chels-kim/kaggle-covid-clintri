  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of home-based exercises versus control for older adults during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis is that participation in a home-based program will reduce&#xD;
      the risk of adverse effects of physical distancing by decreasing patient-reported disability,&#xD;
      improving mental health and avoiding hospitalization or institutionalization for vulnerable&#xD;
      older people&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:More than 6.5 million Canadians are &gt; 65 years of age. Over half of older&#xD;
      Canadians live with multiple comorbidities, leaving them at high risk of adverse outcomes of&#xD;
      COVID-19. Social isolation and physical distancing orders are especially important to protect&#xD;
      the health of this high-risk population. Vulnerable older Canadians are also at high risk of&#xD;
      physical and mental health deterioration caused by the physical distancing meant to protect&#xD;
      them from COVID-19. Effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences will&#xD;
      require evidence-based strategies to support isolated vulnerable older Canadians. Exercise&#xD;
      interventions can reduce the adverse health effects of social isolation and demonstrate&#xD;
      larger effect sizes in older people with comorbidities. However, no exercise interventions&#xD;
      have been tested in an acute isolation scenario such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which also&#xD;
      requires that exercise interventions be home-based and remotely supported, presenting unique&#xD;
      challenges to participation and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team is uniquely positioned re-orient proven and robust programming, supported by a&#xD;
      national network of investigators and existing infrastructure. We can immediately launch a&#xD;
      large-scale trial to test the effectiveness of a remotely supported home exercise program&#xD;
      (designed in partnership with vulnerable older Canadians) to mitigate the negative&#xD;
      consequences of physical distancing to keep older Canadians healthy and safe from COVID-19.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that participation in the PREPARE program will decrease the individual, health&#xD;
      system and population health impacts of COVID19 induced physical distancing and social&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aims:Estimate the effectiveness of a remotely supported, home-based multimodal&#xD;
      exercise program for older people with multiple comorbidities to improve our primary outcome:&#xD;
      patient-reported disability 90-days after enrollment; secondary outcomes: patient-centered&#xD;
      (depression, anxiety, quality of life, frailty, survival, 1-year disability scores, COVID19&#xD;
      severity) and system-relevant (admissions, emergency visits, institutionalization, costs,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Design, setting and participants: Parallel-arm multicenter randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial at 3 Canadian hospitals. People &gt;65 years old recently discharged home with &gt;2&#xD;
      comorbidities will be included. Intervention: Three month supported home-based exercise&#xD;
      program with demonstrated efficacy, feasibility and acceptability for vulnerable older&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and sample size: We will have 90% power to detect a clinically important difference&#xD;
      of in our primary outcome (validated WHODAS tool, 90-days post-enrollment) with 372&#xD;
      participants (186/arm)&#xD;
