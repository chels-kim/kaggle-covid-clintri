  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a food-specific Go/No-Go (GNG)&#xD;
      computerized training task on weight loss, food evaluation, and disinhibition in a population&#xD;
      of overweight and obese individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the current obesogenic environment, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has&#xD;
      dramatically increased over the past 40 years. As a result, approximately 40% of Americans&#xD;
      attest to being on a diet, with most of these efforts being unsuccessful. Most weight loss&#xD;
      diets rely on self-control and reflective thinking (e.g., making conscious food choices&#xD;
      multiple times per day), despite the fact that responses to appetitive foods often occur&#xD;
      through implicit (unconscious) processes. The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      for weight loss that targets these implicit processes through the use of a computerized,&#xD;
      food-specific, go/no-go task. This task has previously resulted in reduced food consumption&#xD;
      in laboratory settings, and small but significant weight loss in two brief intervention&#xD;
      studies. The purpose of this study is to replicate one prior study and to compare different&#xD;
      doses of the intervention. Participants will be assigned to one of three groups: high&#xD;
      intensity, low intensity, or active control, and will be assessed on a number of variables&#xD;
      pre- and post-intervention. Changes in body weight, food evaluation, frequency of&#xD;
      self-reported food consumption, and eating disinhibition scores will be evaluated. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that individuals receiving the food-specific go/no-go training (high intensity&#xD;
      and low intensity groups) will experience greater weight loss, decreased disinhibition with&#xD;
      food, and reduced snacking of the targeted foods than those in the active control group. It&#xD;
      is also hypothesized that the high intensity intervention will be more effective than the low&#xD;
      intensity intervention across these variables. Moderators (e.g., dietary restraint,&#xD;
      disinhibition) will also be explored throughout this study, along with the mechanism of&#xD;
      devaluation of specific foods.&#xD;
