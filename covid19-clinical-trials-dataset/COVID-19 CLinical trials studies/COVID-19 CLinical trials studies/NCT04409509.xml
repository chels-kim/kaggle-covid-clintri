          -  Positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as&#xD;
             determined using a molecular diagnostic test (reverse transcription polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction [RT-PCR] or equivalent) approved by regulatory authorities (including Food&#xD;
             and Drug Administration or Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) or allowed under an&#xD;
             emergency use authorization within 14 days before Screening. If a false negative&#xD;
             result is suspected, the SARS-CoV-2 test may be repeated within the Screening Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chest CT scan or X ray results confirming interstitial pneumonia&#xD;

          -  Severe COVID 19 disease as evidenced by ≥ 1 of the following criteria at Screening&#xD;
             including within 24 hours before Screening:&#xD;

                  (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 300&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ratio of Arterial oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2&#xD;
                  ratio) &lt; 218 (if PaO2/FiO2 ratio is not available)&#xD;

             intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding peptic ulcer within the last 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular event within 3&#xD;
             months, or a prothrombotic disorder (eg, antithrombin III, protein C or protein S&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction or hypersensitivity (per&#xD;
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) to monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             therapy, or hypersensitivity to the IMP or any excipients of the IMP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving a therapy not permitted during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any clinical or laboratory abnormality or other underlying conditions (eg,&#xD;
             psychological disorders, substance abuse) that would render the subject unsuitable for&#xD;
