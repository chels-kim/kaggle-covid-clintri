  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since initial reports of a novel coronavirus emerged from Hubei province, China, the world&#xD;
      has been engulfed by a pandemic with over 3 million cases and 225,000 deaths by 30th April&#xD;
      2020. Health care systems around the world have struggled to cope with the number of patients&#xD;
      presenting with COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Although the majority&#xD;
      of people infected with the virus have a mild disease, around 20% experience a more severe&#xD;
      illness leading to hospital admission and sometimes require treatment in intensive care.&#xD;
      People that survive severe COVID-19 are likely to have persistent health problems that would&#xD;
      benefit from rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a multidisciplinary program which is designed to improve&#xD;
      physical and social performance and is typically provided for people with chronic lung&#xD;
      conditions. PR courses typically last 6-12 weeks with patients attending classes once or&#xD;
      twice weekly and consist of exercise and education components. PR is known to improve&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g. breathlessness), quality of life and ability to exercise in those with lung&#xD;
      conditions. Breathlessness is a very common symptom reported by people presenting to hospital&#xD;
      with COVID-19 and loss of physical fitness will be very common. Using existing pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation programmes as a model, we have developed a tele-rehabilitation programme (a&#xD;
      programme that will be delivered using video link to overcome the challenges faced by social&#xD;
      distancing and shielding advice) for people that have been critically ill with COVID-19. In&#xD;
      order to prove whether people benefit from this tele-rehabilitation programme after being&#xD;
      admitted to hospital following COVID-19 we would need to perform a large clinical trial.&#xD;
      However, before doing this it is important for us to answer some key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many people that have been admitted to hospital and needed intensive care treatment&#xD;
           for COVID-19 still report breathlessness, fatigue, cough and limitation of activities&#xD;
           after being discharged from hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is it possible to recruit these people to a trial of tele-rehabilitation after hospital&#xD;
           discharge?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are people willing and able to perform tele-rehabilitation in their own home using&#xD;
           video-link to connect with their therapist?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there other rehabilitation needs that are commonly encountered by people requiring&#xD;
           intensive care treatment for COVID-19 that could be addressed by tele-rehabilitation&#xD;
           that the programme doesn't currently address? Investigators will perform a small study&#xD;
           called a feasibility trial to answer these questions and gather some early information&#xD;
           about possible benefits of tele-rehabilitation. Based on our understanding of other&#xD;
           similar diseases, doctors and therapists think that people will benefit from&#xD;
           rehabilitation after COVID-19. The investigators therefore want to test a trial design&#xD;
           that makes sure that everyone gets the treatment. This type of trial is called a&#xD;
           feasibility, wait-list design randomised controlled trial. People with breathlessness&#xD;
           and some limitation of activities will be selected at random to receive&#xD;
           tele-rehabilitation within 2 weeks or to wait 6-8 weeks before starting. how many people&#xD;
           were eligible to take part, how many agreed to take part and the symptoms and&#xD;
           rehabilitation needs that they have will be assessed. Investigators will then monitor&#xD;
           symptoms and ability to exercise at the start and end of the trial and before and after&#xD;
           tele-rehabilitation.&#xD;

      STUDY AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aim: To address the uncertainties relating to the design and&#xD;
      conduct of a tele-rehabilitation programme and substantive phase 3 randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate its effectiveness for people that have been hospitalised with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      required additional respiratory support (non-invasive and / or invasive ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Specific study objectives will address uncertainties in four areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment: To identify contact:consent ratio, screen failure rate, recruitment and&#xD;
           participant retention rate. This will inform the number of sites needed to enrol&#xD;
           sufficient participants within an acceptable timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention: To assess the acceptability and fidelity of the intervention by measuring&#xD;
           adherence in delivery and uptake. Identify additional rehabilitation needs that are not&#xD;
           addressed by the tele-rehabilitation programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data quality: To assess the amount and pattern of missing data for study measures. Data&#xD;
           variability across the range of outcome measures will also be assessed. These findings&#xD;
           will inform the choice of primary and secondary outcomes for a definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcome: To assess the best primary outcome and agree other study measures for a&#xD;
           definitive trial by identifying i) data completion (objective 3), ii) data variability&#xD;
           for potential primary outcome measures to inform sample size calculation for the&#xD;
           definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above feasibility study objectives changes in symptoms, quality of life&#xD;
      and measures of functional capacity over time to provide preliminary insights into the&#xD;
      natural history of recovery post COVID-19 and potential effect of tele-rehabilitation will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . STUDY DESIGN Single centre, fast-track (wait-list), randomised controlled feasibility trial&#xD;
      of tele-rehabilitation for patients that have been hospitalised with COVID-19 and required&#xD;
      non-invasive and/or invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to&#xD;
      fast-track or wait-list groups using random permuted blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY The tele-rehabilitation programme will be delivered by trained therapists and will be&#xD;
      structured using conventional pulmonary rehabilitation principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to fast-track or wait-list groups. All participants will&#xD;
      receive the intervention during the course of the trial. Participants randomised to the&#xD;
      fast-track group will receive the intervention 14 ± 7 days after randomisation. Participants&#xD;
      randomised to the wait-list group will receive the intervention 56 ± 7 days after&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TELE-REHABILITATION INTERVENTION The tele-rehabilitation programme will be delivered via an&#xD;
      NHSX / NHS Digital approved commercial video conferencing application. It will comprise an&#xD;
      initial assessment followed by 12 classes delivered by video link over a 6 week period.&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to undertake exercises on 5 days each week Participants will be&#xD;
      contacted by the interventional physiotherapists prior to commencing the intervention and&#xD;
      undertake a virtual (telephone or video) consultation to check eligibility, accessibility and&#xD;
      safety to exercise with remote supervision. At this consultation they will be provided with&#xD;
      the exercise programme based on their current level of exercise tolerance and functional&#xD;
      activity level. Twice a week they will be invited to join a virtual exercise and education&#xD;
      group during which the therapists can observe the participants undertaking the exercises.&#xD;
      This will allow for safety checks, progression or modifications to be made to the exercises&#xD;
      by the therapists. Participants will be taken through a warm up and cool down plus exercise,&#xD;
      after which they will be invited to stay to receive educational advice on relevant topics&#xD;
      such as managing breathlessness; managing fatigue; diet and hydration; the importance of&#xD;
      exercise; returning to the workplace etc. Participants will also be allowed time to share&#xD;
      experiences with each other to engender a sense of community and peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARRANGING THE INTERVENTION Site staff will be trained in local procedures for referral for&#xD;
      the intervention. Referral will be undertaken immediately following randomisation and&#xD;
      participants informed of their group allocation and start date of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Fidelity Training in the tele-rehabilitation programme will be provided for the&#xD;
      therapists involved in intervention delivery. The tele-rehabilitation being delivered has&#xD;
      been developed locally as the standard clinical care. For the purpose of the trial, training&#xD;
      will be delivered by local therapist familiar with the intervention. A record of staff&#xD;
      training in the intervention should be retained in the site file and only those that have&#xD;
      received training should be involved in intervention delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the intervention should be documented by the delivering therapist within the&#xD;
      participant's medical record and CRF. If any components of the intervention are not delivered&#xD;
      then the reason for this must be documented in the participant's medical record and CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This is a feasibility trial and therefore the primary outcome measures&#xD;
      address areas of uncertainty relating to design and delivery of tele-rehabilitation and a&#xD;
      Phase 3 randomised controlled trial. These outcomes are termed feasibility outcomes. As part&#xD;
      of this trial a number of clinical outcomes will be evaluated with the aim of identifying the&#xD;
      most appropriate primary outcome for a subsequent trial and evaluating acceptability and&#xD;
      suitability of these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following feasibility outcomes will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment: Contact to consent ratio; screen failure rate; recruitment rate;&#xD;
           retention/follow-up rates at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data quality: completion of clinical outcomes (questionnaires and other assessments) at&#xD;
           each time point and patterns of missing data for the study measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: Adherence in delivery and uptake documented in the clinical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be measured and data synthesized to inform the sample size of a&#xD;
      definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traffic light system will be used for feasibility outcomes Clinical Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The modified Medical research Council Dyspnoea Scale (mMRC) will be used to assess&#xD;
                the effect of breathlessness on participants' daily activities. This 5 stage scale&#xD;
                measures perceived respiratory disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Numerical rating scales (NRS, scored 0-10 where 0 = no breathlessness and 10 =&#xD;
                worst possible breathlessness) will be used to assess the following aspects of&#xD;
                breathlessness over the past 24 hours: best breathlessness / past 24 hours, worst&#xD;
                breathlessness / past 24 hours, distress caused by breathlessness / past 24 hours,&#xD;
                coping with breathlessness / past 24 hours. The NRS or visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
                is recommended as a unidimensional measure of breathlessness in palliative care&#xD;
                studies [1]. The NRS is preferable to the 0-100mm VAS [2]. It is highly correlated&#xD;
                with VAS scores, but has better test-retest reliability [3, 4], utility [5] and&#xD;
                research in pain shows that patients find them easier to use than VAS scales [6].&#xD;
                Although average NRS is often used, we will only use best and worst intensity NRS&#xD;
                as &quot;average&quot; has been shown to be prone to &quot;Peak-end&quot; bias [7]. Distress has been&#xD;
                used as primary outcomes in trials of breathlessness complex intervention services&#xD;
                [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cough VAS will be used to assess participants cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Modified FACIT-F Scale (version 4) will be used to measure fatigue. This tool&#xD;
                has been demonstrated to a valid and reliable tool in a range of malignant and&#xD;
                non-malignant diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseae (COPD) [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of Life The EQ-5D-5L and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) will be used to&#xD;
           measure participants quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L measures 5 dimensions of health state&#xD;
           (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pan/discomfort and anxiety/depression) using 5&#xD;
           levels (no problem, slight problem, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme&#xD;
           problems). The EQ VAS asks patients to self-rate their health on a vertical VAS from&#xD;
           'the best health you can imagine' to 'the worst health you can imagine'[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mood The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) [11]. The HADS is a short well&#xD;
           validated screening assessment tool which will not add unnecessarily to a participant's&#xD;
           burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The EQ-5D-5L anxiety and depression domain will also provide insight into participants'&#xD;
           mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exercise Capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The One-Minute Sit-to-Stand Test (STST) assesses the number of times a participant can&#xD;
      transition between the sitting and standing positions in a 1 minute period. The STST has&#xD;
      shown good correlation with other well validated measures of functional capacity in people&#xD;
      with chronic respiratory disease [12] and is suitable for an elderly population [13].&#xD;
      Participants will undertake this assessment in their own homes while observed over a video&#xD;
      link. The requirement for specific equipment and space precludes the use of other measures of&#xD;
      functional capacity (for example, the 6-minute walk test or incremental shuttle walk test).&#xD;
      Other than a chair, the STST requires no specialised equipment and therefore can be&#xD;
      undertaken by participants in their own homes.&#xD;
