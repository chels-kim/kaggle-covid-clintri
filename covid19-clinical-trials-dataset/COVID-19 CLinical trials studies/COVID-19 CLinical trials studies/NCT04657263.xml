  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vaccination policy is drawn up in France by the French Minister of Health, who makes&#xD;
      public the vaccination schedule after the opinion of the High Authority of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently according to the 2019 immunization schedule, the dTP vaccine is the only mandatory&#xD;
      in the general population with recalls in adults aged 25, 45, 65 and every 10 years. In 2011,&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health estimated that only 50.5% of the general population was up to date&#xD;
      against dTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two vaccines are recommended for person at risk of infection according to the current vaccine&#xD;
      schedule: the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine. In fact, influenza and pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease are more frequent and more serious in patients with chronic diseases (diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiac insufficiency..) compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccination coverage rate of at-risk populations is dramatically below the vaccination&#xD;
      coverage targets set by the Ministry of Health. Indeed, there are many barriers to&#xD;
      vaccination, medical and para-medical barriers, but also individual barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current COVID-19 pandemic has identified people at risk of severe infection and death&#xD;
      risk, particularly those with co-morbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.). Thus,&#xD;
      this pandemic may have contributed to change in patients' perceptions regarding both the risk&#xD;
      of infection and the potential interest and benefit of vaccination.&#xD;
