      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial disease is a rare disorder. It can cause poor growth, developmental delays,&#xD;
      muscle weakness, and other symptoms. The disease is usually inherited. It can be present at&#xD;
      birth or develop later in life. Infection is a major cause of disease and death in people&#xD;
      with this disease. Researchers want to learn more about how infection and the declining&#xD;
      health of people who have this disease may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this,&#xD;
      researchers will study the DNA of people who become ill with suspected or confirmed&#xD;
      coronavirus. Their DNA will be compared to the DNA of their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how genes may play a role in how COVID-19 affects people with&#xD;
      mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 2 months and older with mitochondrial disease and a suspected or confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of COVID-19.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire about their health history. Their medical records&#xD;
      may be reviewed. They will give a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant becomes ill, they may have a videoconference with a doctor or nurse at the&#xD;
      NIH to perform a physical exam. They may be contacted after their illness to give updates on&#xD;
      their health. They may be asked to give extra blood samples or complete extra questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants genetic data will be put into a database. The data will be labeled with a code&#xD;
      and not their name. The data will be shared with other researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts about 1 year. This may be extended if the participant is very ill.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality individuals with mitochondrial disease,&#xD;
      frequently triggering metabolic decompensation, multiorgan dysfunction, and neurologic&#xD;
      deterioration. In the context of the recent COVID19 pandemic, people with mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease are at increased risk for severe disease and poor outcomes if infected. However, the&#xD;
      mechanisms for this link between infection and clinical decline are incompletely understood.&#xD;
      Given that people with mitochondrial disease are particularly susceptible to infection and&#xD;
      may experience delayed recovery, we hypothesize that this is in part due to immune factors&#xD;
      that influence host-pathogen interactions. The purpose of this protocol is to collect&#xD;
      biological specimens to identify immune signatures that contribute to the phenotype of&#xD;
      infection and outcomes in patients with mitochondrial disease who become ill during the&#xD;
      COVID19 pandemic. In order to compare these cases with others of similar genetic backgrounds&#xD;
      and environmental exposures, we will also collect specimens from family members. We will then&#xD;
      examine how these signatures correlate with comprehensive quantifiable clinical measures&#xD;
      throughout the course of disease, from presenting symptoms, through acute decompensation,&#xD;
      stabilization and convalescence. While this protocol is developed during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic with a focus on a specific infectious pathogen, we hope that this study will extend&#xD;
      beyond the pandemic in an effort to more broadly understand acute infectious illness in&#xD;
      patients with mitochondrial disease. Additionally, it will serve as a remote adjunct to the&#xD;
      NIH MINI Study, a natural history study focused on the immunophenotype of mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease that is conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

        Two study populations will be recruited. (Group 1) Participants with mitochondrial disease&#xD;
        in any location who are two months of age or older and become acutely ill during the&#xD;
        COVID19 pandemic; (Group 2) Family members of group 1 to serve as controls. We anticipate&#xD;
        approximately 50 participants in group 1 and up to 150 participants in Group 2.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 1a&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be two months of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must have a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based on a determination&#xD;
             by a physician with expertise in genetics and/or neurology. Supportive evidence may&#xD;
             include genetic testing, muscle biopsy, biochemical testing, neuroimaging or enzyme&#xD;
             analysis consistent with mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At the time of enrollment, participants must have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as&#xD;
             defined by&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. New onset of any of the following symptoms after January 2020 without an&#xD;
                  alternative diagnosis: fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat,&#xD;
                  rhinorrhea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, neurologic&#xD;
                  decline;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  AND report that testing for COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 is clinically indicated based on&#xD;
                  evaluation by a healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Laboratory confirmed positive testing for COVID-19/SARS-Cov-2 performed at a&#xD;
                  local healthcare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: It is well recognized at the time of this protocol that testing for&#xD;
        COVID-19/SARS-Cov-2 is not consistently available or efficient throughout the United&#xD;
        States, particularly in low healthcare resource settings. In order to avoid bias by&#xD;
        limiting recruitment to only those individuals with access to these healthcare resources,&#xD;
        inclusion criteria for participants with acute illness have intentionally been kept&#xD;
&#xD;
        broad. Participants in Group 1 who are initially suspected to have COVID-19 but are later&#xD;
        found to have an alternative infectious illness will be used for comparison studies. Please&#xD;
        also note that there is no minimum weight requirement for Group 1. However, there is a&#xD;
        minimum weight requirement for phlebotomy procedures (See Sections 1.2 and 7.3.1). Group 1&#xD;
        participants who do not meet minimum weight requirements may enroll for records and&#xD;
        questionnaires only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 1b&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be two months of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must have a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based on a determination&#xD;
             by a physician with expertise in genetics and/or neurology. Supportive evidence may&#xD;
             include genetic testing, muscle biopsy, biochemical testing, neuroimaging or enzyme&#xD;
             analysis consistent with mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At the time of enrollment, participants may not have evidence of any acute infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be two months of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must weigh greater than 4 kilograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be genetically related family member of a participant in Group 1&#xD;
             above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
