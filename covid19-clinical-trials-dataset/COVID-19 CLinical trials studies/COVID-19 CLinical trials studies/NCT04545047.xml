    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether convalescent plasma therapy is associated with&#xD;
      reduced 30-day all-cause mortality in a population of Veteran inpatients with non-severe&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The convalescent plasma (CP) of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may help reduce&#xD;
      symptoms and mortality when given to ill patients infected with severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical trials are needed to provide definitive&#xD;
      evidence of the benefits and harms of CP in the treatment of COVID-19. While clinical trials&#xD;
      are underway, observational research plays a critical role in providing preliminary&#xD;
      scientific evidence to guide clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to estimate the association between CP therapy and mortality&#xD;
      after 30 days in a sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with non-severe illness. Patients&#xD;
      include those hospitalized at a facility within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of&#xD;
      the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the&#xD;
      United States. Using VA electronic health record data, the study is designed to emulate a&#xD;
      target trial of convalescent plasma transfusion and mortality. The primary exposure of&#xD;
      interest is the use or non-use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, and the primary outcome is&#xD;
      30-day all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nested trial design will be used, in which patients will be followed from each day in which&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are met (while hospitalized and after date of first positive SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      test) for 30 days. The association between CP therapy and mortality will be assessed using&#xD;
      pooled logistic models to estimate 30-day cumulative incidence curves, risk differences, and&#xD;
      hazard ratios. Inverse probability weighting derived from propensity scores will be employed&#xD;
      to minimize confounding by indication and other biases.&#xD;
