      This study aims to examine the tolerability of high dose of leflunomide in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 who are being managed in the outpatient setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single are and single-center tolerability study of high dose leflunomide therapy in&#xD;
      outpatient adult participants with mild COVID-19. In vitro studies have shown antiviral&#xD;
      effects of leflunomide against SARS CoV-2, but the clinical outcomes in the disease have been&#xD;
      variable. Our hypothesis is that targeting high risk patients earlier in the disease course&#xD;
      and with a higher dose regimen are both required to see improvement in disease outcome&#xD;
      measures in COVID-19. This study aims to prove the tolerability of high dose leflunomide in&#xD;
      this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are selected based on identification of mild COVID-19 symptoms. Investigators will&#xD;
      enroll twenty patients and perform a detailed Tele-helath interview to ensure they meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and provide informed consent. 100 mg leflunomide daily for three days&#xD;
      followed by 30 mg day will be prescribed. The subjects will be required to monitor their&#xD;
      temperatures twice daily and a daily telephone call with an investigatory will review&#xD;
      symptoms of disease and potential side effects of the drug. Subjects can discontinue the drug&#xD;
      after five days if they no longer have fever, or take the drug for up to ten days if required&#xD;
      for fever resolution.&#xD;
