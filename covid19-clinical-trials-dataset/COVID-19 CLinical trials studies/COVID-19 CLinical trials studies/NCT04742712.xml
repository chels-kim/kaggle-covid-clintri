  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point of care testing is urgently required to enable the immediate detection of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection to allow effective transmission prevention precautions to succeed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Coronacheck device is a hand-held, portable, point-of-care device which will allow the&#xD;
      safe collection of EBC. It provides an automated platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      using an existing sensor repurposed with immobilised recombinant ACE-2 to bind the virus.&#xD;
      This produces a measurable signal indicating whether SARS-CoV-2 is present or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBC is collected by the CoronaCheck device during tidal breathing, making this investigation&#xD;
      non-invasive, repeatable and easy to perform. Previous studies using Inflammacheck™ in people&#xD;
      with respiratory conditions have shown it is well tolerated, even in people with severe lung&#xD;
      disease. The full test cycle including sample collection and test assay typically occurs in&#xD;
      less than 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the risk of infection, this CoronaCheck™ device has an integrated sensor and breath&#xD;
      collection system combined in a fully enclosed, disposable unit to mitigate the risk of&#xD;
      cross-infections between users and also reduces any exposure risk to healthcare staff. It is&#xD;
      appreciated that disposable plastic has a negative environmental impact, however due to the&#xD;
      highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 it is felt unavoidable at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the CoronaCheck does not require laboratory equipment or expertise, and is a quick,&#xD;
      easy-to-use point-of-care investigation which provides an immediate result. This could&#xD;
      potentially be applied to screening for SARS-CoV-2 in a wide variety of environments for&#xD;
      example: GP practices, drive-thru centres, colleges, universities, airports and sports&#xD;
      arenas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any person undergoing a swab for a possible SARS CoV-2 infection is eligible for inclusion,&#xD;
      participants will not be assigned an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will breathe into the CoronaCheck device. This involves breathing for up to&#xD;
      6 minutes into a single use, fully sealed unit attached to the hand-held device. This&#xD;
      disposable unit has a bacterial-viral filter attached to both the breathing inlet and the&#xD;
      exhale outlet to eliminate any risk of contamination. The CoronaCheck device then provides a&#xD;
      reading reflecting EBC ACE2 binding which will be documented on the eCRF. This result will&#xD;
      not be recorded in the clinical notes as it is not intended to inform patient management&#xD;
      decisions in this study.&#xD;

        A cross-sectional study including four groups at different stages of the diagnostic and&#xD;
        screening process for potential SARS-CoV-2 infection, utilising RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal&#xD;
        swab as the current gold standard:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 confirmed with a positive RT-PCR&#xD;
             swab (inpatient or outpatient testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 but a negative RT-PCR swab&#xD;
             (inpatient or outpatient testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Asymptomatic participants with a low clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 but a positive&#xD;
             RT-PCR swab&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Asymptomatic participants with a low clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 and a negative&#xD;
             RT-PCR swab&#xD;
