      The paediatric population present mild or asymptomatic form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This&#xD;
      study asses the frequency of patients with SARS-CoV2 Antibodies (Ab) (seroprevalence) and the&#xD;
      neutralizing typology of those Ab (immunoprotection) in children from 7 days to 18 years of&#xD;
      age hospitalized for no more than 4 days and whose clinical status requires blood sample&#xD;
      regardless of the symptoms Patients are included on a given day, after information, before&#xD;
      blood sampling performed as part of the care. 500 µL of sera, normally discarded will be kept&#xD;
      to perform SARS-Cov2 serology.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fraction of undiagnosed cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates&#xD;
      the epidemic potential of SARS-CoV-2 emerging respiratory virus. These subjects most often&#xD;
      present themselves in benign or totally asymptomatic form, although they are likely to spread&#xD;
      the virus in the general population. The containment strategy was implemented in France to&#xD;
      reverse the exponential epidemic growth of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crucial issue is the specific study of the paediatric population because the prevalence of&#xD;
      symptomatic infections is low and children are mostly mild and under-diagnosed. Children&#xD;
      could frequently be asymptomatic carriers and act as a real reservoir for the spread of the&#xD;
      virus. In these &quot;sub-symptomatic&quot; carriers, the viral load may be low, and it is possible&#xD;
      that PCR nasal tests may be defective. The serological study is therefore essential because&#xD;
      it will inform us about the speed and effectiveness of seroconversion and therefore about the&#xD;
      immunoprotection of this subpopulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the study is that the proportion of children who have developed&#xD;
      immunoprotection is decisive in defining measures to control the epidemic. It is essential to&#xD;
      assess the prevalence and typology of antibody responses in this population and to follow&#xD;
      kinetics over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The many emerging atypical forms and in particular the post-infectious kawasaki-like forms&#xD;
      have a very particular immunopathological profile that provides information on the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives of the study to assess the prevalence of seroconversion (seroprevalence) in a&#xD;
      pediatric population sample to study the immunopathological profile of clinical forms&#xD;
      attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study Patients are included on a given day, after information, before blood&#xD;
      sampling performed as part of the care. 500 µL of sera, normally discarded will be kept to&#xD;
      perform SARS-Cov2 serology. According to data currently collected in France, 5% of children&#xD;
      taken from symptoms are infected. Given that nasopharyngeal testing is lacking in this&#xD;
      pediatric population, we anticipate an increase in the number of subjects who have been&#xD;
      infected or have an ongoing infection at least 10%. A sample of 800 subjects will therefore&#xD;
      include at least 80 children with infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire will extract relevant variables to this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any symptoms of the index case or his family since December 2019 consistent with&#xD;
           COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reason for hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of contact case&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical signs on the day of collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Result of RT-PCT SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal if made in the index case&#xD;
