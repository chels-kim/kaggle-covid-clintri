    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, two arms, placebo controlled, clinical trial to study to&#xD;
      evaluate the the safety and efficacy of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      versus placebo with standard of care for preventing the progression of COVID-19 disease and&#xD;
      for reduction in transfer to ICU in COVID-19 infected patients admitted to the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 480 hospitalized adult eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      either Mw+SOC or placebo+SOC for first 3 days post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily clinical evaluation of patient will be performed till discharge from hospital or till&#xD;
      ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration for each patient will be approximately up to 28 days, or discharge from&#xD;
      hospital or transfer to ICU, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
