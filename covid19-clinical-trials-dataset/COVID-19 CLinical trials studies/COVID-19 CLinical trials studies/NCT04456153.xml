      The purpose of the current study is to accelerate the use of a clinically available&#xD;
      therapeutic already FDA-approved for other indications in the setting of pandemic COVID-19&#xD;
      addressing a serious and emergent unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind study of atovaquone therapy in adult participants&#xD;
      hospitalized with COVID-19. Approximately 60 participants who meet all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      may be randomized in a 2:1 atovaquone/placebo ratio into one of the following treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1: continued standard of care therapy together with an oral dose of 1500 mg&#xD;
      atovaquone twice daily (administered with a meal or snack) for up to 10 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2: continued standard of care therapy together with matching placebo&#xD;

      Design of the ATaQ COVID-19 Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to accelerate the use of a clinically available&#xD;
      therapeutic already FDA-approved for other indications in the setting of pandemic COVID-19&#xD;
      addressing a serious and emergent unmet medical need. In consideration of the information&#xD;
      included in this protocol, the overall risks to participants are outweighed by the potential&#xD;
      benefits of atovaquone experimental therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. The benefit-risk&#xD;
      balance for this study is considered positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosis of COVID-19 by positive RT-PCR requiring hospitalization within 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age ≥18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Able to provide informed consent, or (as allowed by IRB), immediate availability of&#xD;
           designated legally authorized representative to provide consent by proxy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anticipated hospitalization for &gt;48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participation in any other clinical trial with antiviral activity against COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Known hypersensitivity to atovaquone or formulation excipient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Active treatment with rifampin&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. HIV patients with AIDS requiring treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii or Toxoplasma&#xD;
           gondii&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Not expected to survive for 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. &gt;14 days from symptom onset&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who meet eligibility criteria and volunteer to participate will be randomized&#xD;
           in a 2:1 ratio to atovaquone or placebo on Day 1 using computerized randomization. An&#xD;
           unblinded investigational pharmacist not otherwise involved in the trial will know&#xD;
           treatment assignment and dispense investigational product. As GI absorption of&#xD;
           atovaquone increased when taken with food, so we will administer with a meal or snack.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Double blinding of treatment assignments will be performed in this study, with the study&#xD;
           team and patients blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The list of concomitant medications will be assessed only from Day 1 prior to enrollment&#xD;
           to Day 15 or discharge, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient Enrollment and Treatment Assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Entry into screening does not guarantee enrollment into the study. In order to manage&#xD;
           the total study enrollment, the study researchers may suspend screening and/or&#xD;
           enrollment at any at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pretreatment Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be screened within 2 days before randomization and dosing to determine&#xD;
           eligibility for participation in the study. Screening will occur under approved HIPAA&#xD;
           waiver for research to identify and screen all hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients&#xD;
           on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After informed consent has been negotiated and the form signed, the following&#xD;
           assessments will be performed to determine eligibility requirements as specified in the&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Review of focused medical history including the following information (e.g., date&#xD;
                of first symptoms, overall symptoms, exposure source, demographics, baseline&#xD;
                characteristics), allergies and past medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Review and record medications and therapies for the current illness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording of vital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure), body weight,&#xD;
                and height&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of respiratory support: Respiratory Rate, Oxygen supplementation:&#xD;
                room air, nasal canula, face mask, non-rebreather, high-flow device, mechanical&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  SpO2 at rest or PaO2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiographic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study patients who qualify and volunteer to participate should be immediately consented&#xD;
           and randomized. Randomization and initiation of dosing should occur on the same day if&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline/Day 1 Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following evaluations are to be completed at the Day 1 visit. The investigator must&#xD;
           have confirmed eligibility and signing of consent before proceeding with randomization&#xD;
           on the Day 1 visit, followed immediately by first dose of investigational product. The&#xD;
           assessments can be completed by the patient care team and do not need to be repeated by&#xD;
           research personnel. The following assessments must be documented before administering&#xD;
           investigational product, using the most recent data available at the time of&#xD;
           randomization:&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Additional blood draws for biobanking (Day 3, and 5 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical Laboratory Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical laboratory assessments will be conducted as clinically indicated and all&#xD;
           laboratory testing will be completed by local laboratories. Clinical laboratory data to&#xD;
           be captured in the trial database will include serum chemistries, liver function tests,&#xD;
           complete blood counts including absolute neutrophil count, hs-CRP, D-dimer, ferritin,&#xD;

           and last day of hospitalization or Day 15 if still hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pretreatment and posttreatment samples with detectable SARS-CoV-2 may be sequenced for&#xD;
           resistance monitoring of the viral polymerase gene. For all clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
           except those at Day 1, when more than 1 result is available in a calendar day, the value&#xD;
           closest to 12:00 noon should be captured in the eCRF. For Day 1 tests, the most recent&#xD;
           result before dosing should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physical Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           No physical examination is mandated by the study protocol beyond the capture of vital&#xD;
           signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, SpO2 at rest or PaO2)&#xD;
           as documented clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-treatment Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment will continue to complete a 10 Day course or until viral clearance is&#xD;
           documented, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Telephone call on Day 15 and 29 for those discharged. The phone call will include a&#xD;
           brief survey on symptoms and information on any re-hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Final review of AEs and concomitant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vital signs will be captured if still inpatient and the ordinal scale will be assessed.&#xD;
