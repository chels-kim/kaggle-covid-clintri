  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early inhibition of entry and replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very promising therapeutic approach. Polyclonal neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunt an&#xD;
      early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because a suboptimal endogenous early antibody response with regard to SARS-CoV-2 replication&#xD;
      in severe cases is observed, neutralising antibody treatment can be very interesting for&#xD;
      patient with COVID-19 induced moderate pneumonia4,5. Convalescent plasma to treat infected&#xD;
      patients is therefore an interesting therapeutic option currently under evaluation. However,&#xD;
      the difficulties of collecting plasma and its safety aspects are not adapted to many&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) is being developed by&#xD;
      Xenothera, which can be administered as intravenous treatment. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine&#xD;
      glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      inhibiting infection of ACE-2 positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates and a&#xD;
      First In Human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in&#xD;
      volunteer patients recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive&#xD;
      administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this 2-steps phase 2 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study is 1)&#xD;
      to define the optimal and safety XAV-19 dose to administrate in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      induced moderate pneumonia ; 2) to show the clinical benefit of selected dose of XAV-19 when&#xD;
      administered to patients with COVID-19 induced moderate pneumonia.&#xD;
