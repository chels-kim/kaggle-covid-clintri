      Participants will be assigned into 3 groups equal in number (group A, group B, group C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (Respiratory Training Group) : It will include 30 patients of both sexes, recovered&#xD;
      from COVID-19 infection. In addition to medical drugs, they will receive respiratory training&#xD;
      for 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>patient will be instructed to walk as fast as long as possible, in a 30 meters obstacle- free corridor, limited by turnaround cones. Standardized verbal encouragement will be given every minute. After 6 min, patient will be instructed to stop, and the total distance will be measured, rounding to the nearest meter.</description>

    <description>aerobic exercises are customized according to the patient's underlying disease and residual dysfunction. These exercises will include walking on treadmill. After an initial, 5-minute warm-up phase performed on the treadmill at a low load, each endurance training session lasted 30 minutes and ended with 5-minute recovery and relaxation phase. A total of 3-5 sessions are carried out per week. Patients who are prone to fatigue should perform intermittent exercises</description>
