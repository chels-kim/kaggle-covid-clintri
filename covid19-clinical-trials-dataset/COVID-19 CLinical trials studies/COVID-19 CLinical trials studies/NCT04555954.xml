      Abstract Background: With Covid-19 pandemic, online education, remote and flexible working&#xD;
      were introduced. Thus the process of stay-at-home began.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The aim of the study is to determine level of physical activity of healthy adults in&#xD;
      the pandemic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a descriptive survey study which was applied via internet. The physical&#xD;
      activity level was evaluated with International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form.&#xD;
      Healthy adults aged 18-65 years who live in Turkey were included in the study.&#xD;

      Study design This study, which was planned as a prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey study, had online-based questions. The participants answered the questions via the&#xD;
      internet between April-July 2020. Ethical approval of the study was obtained from the&#xD;
      Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Afyonkarahisar Health Science&#xD;
      University (Date/issue:2020/318) and the study follows the principles of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. All individuals were informed through written online documents and they were&#xD;
      permitted to answer the questions after the informed consent approval button was clicked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Communication with the participants of the study was conducted via online survey&#xD;
      software (Google Forms) and social media communication application (WhatsApp). The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the participants were as follows; to be between the age of 18-65, healthy&#xD;
      (physically, psychologically and cognitively) and to live in Turkey. Individuals with&#xD;
      pregnancy, with a history of any surgery in the last 6 months, and with the presence of any&#xD;
      acute or chronic diseases (infection-related, neurological, rheumatological, cardiovascular,&#xD;
      orthopedic… etc.) were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The demographic data of the participants and the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaires-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) were recorded using the internet. Participants&#xD;
      needed approximately 10 minutes to answer the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaires-Short Form (IPAQ-SF): In our study, we used&#xD;
      IPAQ-SF which was developed for international screening studies with the support of the WHO.&#xD;
      The validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the questionnaire were performed by&#xD;
      Sağlam et al. (2010). The short form of the questionnaire (7 questions) provides information&#xD;
      about walking, moderate and vigorous activities and time spent sitting. Total score&#xD;
      calculation of the short form included the sum of frequency (days) and duration (minutes) of&#xD;
      walking, moderate and vigorous activities. The energy required for the activities was&#xD;
      calculated with the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)-minute score. The sitting score&#xD;
      (sedentary behavior level) was calculated separately. A score as &quot;MET-minute / week&quot; was&#xD;
      obtained by multiplying the minute, day and MET value (multiples of resting oxygen&#xD;
      consumption). Walking time (minutes) was multiplied by 3.3 MET for the calculation of the&#xD;
      walking score. During the calculation, 4 MET values for a moderate activities, and 8 MET&#xD;
      values for vigorous activities were used. Following the calculation, a MET score under 600&#xD;
      was regarded as physically inactive; a score between 600 and 3000 was regarded as minimally&#xD;
      active and a score of over 3000 was regarded as sufficiently active or Health-Enhancing&#xD;
      Physical Activity.&#xD;
