      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will prospectively evaluate and analyze changes in the appearance of&#xD;
           the lungs and heart through serial acquisition of focused point-of-care ultrasound&#xD;
           images in a cohort of patients with or under investigation for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will correlate changes noted in ultrasound with clinical course and&#xD;
           diagnostic evaluation to ascertain whether changes on ultrasound could improve care&#xD;
           through earlier diagnosis or identification of patients at high risk of disease&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a descriptive study aimed at identifying the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      ultrasound features in patients with or under investigation for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at two sites: University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC) and&#xD;
      Bethesda Hospital. At UMMC, a tertiary care center, clinicians will recruit and evaluate&#xD;
      patients with or under investigation for COVID-19. At Bethesda clinicians will recruit and&#xD;
      evaluate patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 as demonstrated by a positive&#xD;
      PT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POCUS exams will be performed in a cohort of 200-500 patients with or under investigation for&#xD;
      COVID-19. Serial ultrasound examinations will be performed every 48-72 hours until discharge,&#xD;
      death, or study completion. Participants will undergo POCUS at enrollment by their treating&#xD;
      physicians. Inquiry into study enrollment will be performed over the phone rather than in&#xD;
      person, given the current scarcity of PPE and the added use that would occur with in-person&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
