    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of ibrutinib in treating patients with B-cell&#xD;
      malignancies who are infected with COVID-19. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Ibrutinib is a first in class Bruton&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. This study is&#xD;
      being done to determine if taking ibrutinib after contracting COVID-19 will make symptoms&#xD;
      better or worse.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize and describe the patterns of temporary interruption vs. continuation of&#xD;
      ibrutinib after their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis and their corresponding&#xD;
      rates of hospitalization and/or death by day 28 in an observational cohort of COVID-19&#xD;
      infected patients treated with ibrutinib therapy as their standard of care. (Cohort 1) II. To&#xD;
      determine if continuation of ibrutinib during COVID-19 infection among patients who are&#xD;
      hospitalized can result in decreased need for mechanical ventilation and decreased mortality&#xD;
      by day 28 compared to patients who suspend temporarily ibrutinib treatment after their&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To determine the average length of time from diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection to need for hospitalization due to worsening disease. (Cohort 1) II. To determine&#xD;
      the rate of viral clearance on days 15, 28, 42, and 56 after registration. (Cohort 1) III. To&#xD;
      evaluate coagulation parameters at baseline, and on days 15 and 28 after registration.&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) IV. To determine the incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis as well as&#xD;
      bleeding complications. (Cohort 1) V. To evaluate patient-reported health status and quality&#xD;
      of life using the patient reported outcome (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE). (Cohort 1) VI. To determine if patients develop a &quot;flare phenomenon&quot; if&#xD;
      ibrutinib is stopped. (Cohort 1) VII. To evaluate the patterns and timing of restarting&#xD;
      ibrutinib in those patients who suspended their ibrutinib treatment after their COVID-19&#xD;
      diagnosis. (Cohort 1) VIII. To evaluate the association of patient outcomes stratified by the&#xD;
      Charlson Co-morbidity index (CCI). (Cohort 1) IX. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      continuation of ibrutinib. (Cohort 1) X. To evaluate if continued treatment with ibrutinib&#xD;
      can reduce the proportion of patients who die due to any cause in the 28 days after&#xD;
      randomization compared to patients who stop ibrutinib in COVID-19 positive patients who are&#xD;
      hospitalized at the time of study enrollment. (Cohort 2) XI. To evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients, and whether continued ibrutinib therapy&#xD;
      reduces this incidence compared to stopping ibrutinib. (Cohort 2) XII. To determine whether&#xD;
      continued ibrutinib can significantly improve the viral clearance rate at baseline, and on&#xD;
      days 8, 15, 28, 42 and 56 days after randomization compared to those who temporarily&#xD;
      interrupt ibrutinib. (Cohort 2) XIII. To evaluate coagulation parameters at baseline, and on&#xD;
      days 8, 15, and 28 after randomization among patients who continue ibrutinib compared to&#xD;
      those who discontinue ibrutinib. (Cohort 2) XIV. To determine the incidence of arterial and&#xD;
      venous thrombosis as well as bleeding complications in patients who continue ibrutinib&#xD;
      compared to those who stop it. (Cohort 2) XV. To determine if patients who are randomized to&#xD;
      stopping ibrutinib develop &quot;flare phenomenon&quot;. (Cohort 2) XVI. To evaluate the association of&#xD;
      patient outcomes stratified by the Charlson Co-morbidity index (CCI). (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the association of inflammatory status with COVID severity. II. To determine&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who develop antibodies to SARS-CoV2, especially given that&#xD;
      patients with B cell malignancies tend to have inadequate responses to vaccines and often&#xD;
      suffer from hypogammaglobulinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine changes in the immune profile by advanced flow cytometry given that the&#xD;
      status of the immune system , both innate and adaptive , may dictate ultimate host management&#xD;
      and clearance of COVID infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients may continue to receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily or stop ibrutinib per&#xD;
      provider's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2A: Patients continue to receive ibrutinib PO daily in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2B: Patients undergo temporary interruption of ibrutinib for up to 28 days unless they&#xD;
      are discharged home and are thought to be medically fit by the primary caregiver to resume&#xD;
      therapy according to their primary treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 42, 56, and 84 days.&#xD;

    <description>We will evaluate and characterize baseline status and changes in 8 primary COVID-19 related symptoms in these outpatient subjects: fever, loss of smell, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, aching muscles, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. These will be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).
