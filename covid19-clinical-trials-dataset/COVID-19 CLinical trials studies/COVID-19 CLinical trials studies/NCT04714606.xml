    <textblock>
      A Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of an eight-session group intervention for&#xD;
      siblings of children who have an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited from a multi-academy trust of nine schools. They will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated by school (due to COVID-19 restrictions) to the two research arms. Half will&#xD;
      receive a tailored booklet to complete at home and the other half will attend a tailored&#xD;
      support group for siblings of children who have an ASD. Pre and post outcome measures will be&#xD;
      completed by children and their parents in both research arms.&#xD;
