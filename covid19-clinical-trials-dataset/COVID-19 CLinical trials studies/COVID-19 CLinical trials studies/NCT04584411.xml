  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization and is&#xD;
      responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early reports from China suggested an overall cardiac arrhythmia incidence of 17% in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for COVID-19. A higher arrhythmia rate (44%) was observed in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, details of the type and burden&#xD;
      of arrhythmias in this population have not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial injury is common in patients with COVID-19, accounting for 7%-23% of reported&#xD;
      cases in Wuhan, China. Among COVID-related myocardial injury, etiologies vary and can include&#xD;
      myocarditis, myocardial infarction, sepsis-related myocardial injury, and/or stress induced&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Myocardial injury is associated with high risk of developing all types of&#xD;
      arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and variable degrees of heart block. Sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death was also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is a combination of direct viral injury&#xD;
      and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. Although the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      arrhythmias is still speculative, clinicians should provide prompt monitoring and treatment.&#xD;
      The long term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis remains unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is an integral test in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      myocardial injury. It can safely be used as a first-line diagnostic tool in the workup of&#xD;
      myocardial injury associated with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe that proper diagnosis and management of COVID 19 related arrhythmias&#xD;
      and their etiology can lead to both in-hospital and long term reduction of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of this dangerous presentation of the disease.&#xD;

Tissue characterization imaging, T1 and T2.&#xD;

T2-weighted: any of the following standard T2 sequences: regional high signal standard T2 sequences: global signal intensity ratio (myocardium/skeletal muscle) â‰¥2 T2 mapping: increased T2 relaxation times T1-weighted: any of the following late enhancement imaging: non-ischemic (subepicardial or mid myocardial) late enhancement native T1 mapping: increased T1 relaxation times or extracellular volume supportive criteria: signs of pericarditis: effusion or pericardial late enhancement regional or global wall motion abnormalities[5]</description>
