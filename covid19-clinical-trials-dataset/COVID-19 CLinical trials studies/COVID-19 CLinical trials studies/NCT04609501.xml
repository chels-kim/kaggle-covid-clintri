  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about unprecedented social, economic and&#xD;
      mental-health challenges, especially for vulnerable populations such as pregnant and&#xD;
      post-partum females. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relations between the fear of&#xD;
      COVID-19 and postnatal depression symptoms.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter prospective cohort study of childbearing women during COVID-19.&#xD;
      Participants completed a comprehensive online questionnaire including demographic,&#xD;
      socioeconomic, obstetric, and postnatal mental-health questionnaires. Data were verified with&#xD;
      each center's perinatal database and information regarding physiological stress during&#xD;
      pregnancy/birth was also collected. Fear of COVID-19 was evaluated using the validated Fear&#xD;
      of COVID-19 Scale and postnatal depression was evaluated using the EPDS. Pre-existing&#xD;
      maternal disability was defined as prior physiological or psychological chronic health&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
