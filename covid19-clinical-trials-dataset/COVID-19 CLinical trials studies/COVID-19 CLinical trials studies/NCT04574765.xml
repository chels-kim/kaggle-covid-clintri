  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that some individuals may be asymptomatic but continue to shed the&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus. These individuals may represent a population that can unknowingly transmit&#xD;
      the virus. Healthcare workers (HCW) may acquire COVID-19 from the community or from possibly&#xD;
      infected patients. It is important to gather data with respect to this to further understand&#xD;
      the prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in individuals who work in research facilities,&#xD;
      offices and clinical areas of hospitals and research facilities/institutes since this has&#xD;
      important implications for infection control, as well as staff and patient safety. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to test whether a proportion of these individuals may be&#xD;
      asymptomatic shedders of the COVID-19 virus.&#xD;

      Healthcare workers of participating institutions who agree to be participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out some information about participants into a database portal system. Participants&#xD;
           will have the ability to check their COVID-19 test results via the portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs done for COVID-19 testing. This can be done about once a&#xD;
           week for up to 8 weeks (about 1-8 swabs total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide optional blood samples to look for COVID-19 specific antibodies and/or proteins&#xD;
           at the time of enrollment and after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out questionnaires about participant exposures and travel history, occupation&#xD;
           category, any symptoms in the past 21 days, whether they have provided any face-to-face&#xD;
           care of a known COVID-19 positive patients in past 14 days or if participants have any&#xD;
           children at home who are less than 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out an optional questionnaire about their mental health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be contacted by telephone if participants are tested positive, to determine whether&#xD;
           participants have symptoms of COVID-19, and for the results of any follow-up COVID-19&#xD;
           testing that may have been done.&#xD;
