  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is surge in COVID infected patients in New York City with a shortage of hospital beds,&#xD;
      ICU beds and ventilators. Strategies to reduce the need for all of the above are immediately&#xD;
      needed. Further, few interventions are targeted in COVID infected patients early in the&#xD;
      course of their disease and especially in the community/home settings. Respiratory&#xD;
      decompensation appears to occur later in the disease process (i.e. 7-10 days after becoming&#xD;
      symptomatic) therefore many patients are sent home from the Emergency Room and they&#xD;
      subsequently decompensate later at home. Some patients die at home and others are returning&#xD;
      to the Emergency Room with hypoxemic respiratory failure. There is no treatment offered to&#xD;
      this population of patients, i.e. COVID suspected or confirmed and with respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      or abnormal chest x-ray at the time of presentation. Based on experience across the globe,&#xD;
      these patients are likely to worsen at home. The study team therefore proposes a prospective,&#xD;
      single-center, parallel group, open-label, randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of fixed low continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) (FDA approved and often used&#xD;
      for treatment of sleep apnea) in COVID confirmed or suspected patients with abnormal chest&#xD;
      x-ray or respiratory symptoms who do not require hospital admission and are discharged home&#xD;
      from the emergency room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes a randomized controlled trial of CPAP (n=100) vs. control (n=100) in&#xD;
      COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients with pneumonia or respiratory illness. The&#xD;
      overarching aim of this proposal is to determine if early use of CPAP at home will reduce&#xD;
      hypoxemic events or reduce the need for hospital admission or death in COVID-19 suspected or&#xD;
      confirmed patients. The study team will include adult patients (age&gt;18) who live alone or&#xD;
      have more than one bedroom at home, with serologically confirmed or suspected COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, who have one or more of the following: fever (&gt;38ÂºC), sore throat, myalgia or&#xD;
      flu-like illness AND have one or more of the following additional symptom or diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria: abnormal chest x-ray, new onset cough, mild hypoxemia at rest (saturation less than&#xD;
      96%), abnormal lung exam, chest tightness or shortness of breath AND who are without need for&#xD;
      hospital admission. Patients with preexisting pulmonary diseases such as advanced COPD,&#xD;
      advanced parenchymal lung disease, history of pneumothorax etc. will be excluded.&#xD;
      Participants in both arms will be shipped a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation and a&#xD;
      disposable home sleep apnea monitor (WatchPAT) to track blood oxygen level continuously for&#xD;
      12 hours with data feed into a cloud based platform. Additionally, 100 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive CPAP at fixed pressure (8-10cm H20) for 72 hours continuously (except&#xD;
      for daily activities such as eating, personal activities and breaks for ambulation etc). The&#xD;
      CPAP pressure will be adjusted based on patient's comfort but will not deviate from the range&#xD;
      of 8-10cm. While the study protocol will end at 72 hours, patients who wish to continue CPAP&#xD;
      will be allowed to do so for symptomatic benefit up to 7 days from randomization. All CPAP&#xD;
      recipients will be given a full-face mask and will be asked to stay in quarantine for the&#xD;
      duration of the protocol to avoid risk of infecting family members with aerosol (separate&#xD;
      consent to be obtained from household members who are elderly or with comorbidities.) The&#xD;
      study team hypothesizes that early low-grade fixed CPAP in COVID infected patients who have&#xD;
      respiratory abnormalities will reduce hypoxemic events and decrease the risk of subsequent&#xD;
      hospitalization or death in 14 days from randomization. The study will also address whether&#xD;
      use of CPAP in the home increases the risk of infecting household family members.&#xD;
