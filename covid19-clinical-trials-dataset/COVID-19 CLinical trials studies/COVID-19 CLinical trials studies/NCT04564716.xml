      Randomized, double-blind (blinded for the trial subject and the study physician), placebo&#xD;
      controlled, multi-center clinical trial in parallel assignment of efficacy, immunogenicity,&#xD;

      coronavirus infection in adults in the SARS-СoV-2 infection prophylactic treatment.&#xD;

      Overall of 110 volunteers aged 18 to 60 should be screened taking into account possible early&#xD;
      departure from the study. It is supposed that 100 subjects will complete all screening&#xD;
      procedures and will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio into two groups: a control group (using&#xD;
      placebo, 25 subjects) and a study group (using Gam-COVID-Vac Combined Vector Vaccine to&#xD;
      Prevent Coronavirus Infection Caused by SARS-CoV-2&quot;, 75 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation in the study for one subject will be 180±14 days after the&#xD;
      first dose of IMP/placebo, during which each subject will undergo a screening visit and five&#xD;
      face-to-face visits to the doctor-researcher. Intramuscular injection of IMP or placebo will&#xD;
      be carried out on vaccination visits N 1 and N 2 (Day 0 and Day 21±2). Further observation&#xD;
      visits No 3, 4, 5 will be conducted on days 28±2, 42±2 and 180±14 respectively. It is allowed&#xD;
      to conduct observation visits No. 3, 4 via telephone contact (TC). During the monitoring&#xD;
      visits, all subjects of the study will be assessed on key vital indicators and data will be&#xD;
      collected on changes in the status and well-being of the subjects since the previous visit.&#xD;
