      The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting the ability and willingness of&#xD;
      dentists to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of this situation on&#xD;
      occupational burnout. A 51-question survey, including demographic and pandemic questions and&#xD;
      the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), was used as a data collection method and administered to&#xD;
      dentists in Turkey via the internet in two stages. A link to the survey (onlineanketler.com)&#xD;
      was sent to the participants by e-mail or social media (WhatsApp©). A total of 706&#xD;
      participants were included in the study. The second stage of the survey only applied to&#xD;
      dentists who are assigned within the scope of COVID-19 measures in Turkey.&#xD;
