  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal depression is an important problematic in French population with approximatively 10&#xD;
      -20% of women who suffer from postnatal depression. This pathology may have strong negative&#xD;
      impact on both women and neonate's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women's satisfaction degree in front of childbirth is an important factor associated with&#xD;
      postnatal depression since women unsatisfied of their childbirth and/or women with a&#xD;
      complicated childbirth are more encline to suffer from postnatal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that the actual context of Covid 19 pandemia and the change in obstetrical cares&#xD;
      organization may have a negative impact on women's satisfaction about their childbirth and so&#xD;
      a negative impact on the risk of postnatal depression.&#xD;

        Women who deliver of a single baby, at term and in cephalic presentation whatever is the&#xD;
        modalities of delivery (instrumental, cesarean, spontaneous delivery) will be included&#xD;
        after their delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Premature and non cephalic birth will be excluded because they are specific deliveries that&#xD;
        may be assoictaed with a specific maternal anxietey. Women with psychiatric disorders are&#xD;
        excluded since we investigated the occurrence of postnatal depression which is a&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women without any internet access are excluded because women will have to fill online&#xD;
        questionnaires. Finally women will be informed, as well as their doctors, in case of&#xD;
        postnatal depression with an advice of planning a medical consultation.&#xD;
