  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two recent studies have suggested that in patients with Covid19, treatment with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine may shorten the duration of symptoms and improve viral clearance, an&#xD;
      effect that appears most pronounce when combined with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      treatment may inhibit viral nucleic acid-mediated activation of various innate immune&#xD;
      pathways, as well as blockade of lysosomal functions in cell types relevant for viral entry&#xD;
      and antigen presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine if oral hydroxychloroquine monotherapy, or in&#xD;
      combination with azithromycin results in clinical benefit in patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      COVID19 pneumonia.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection confirmed by&#xD;

             of study drug (There might be a patient who cannot be admitted to the ICU, even if the&#xD;
             patient's condition is severe enough, due to administrative reasons under the current&#xD;
