  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the fight against COVID-19, the UK government has announced its most comprehensive&#xD;
      flu campaign to date&#xD;
      (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/most-comprehensive-flu-programme-in-uk-history-will-be-ro&#xD;
      lled-out-this-winter). This should not be surpising: every year NHS hospitals experience an&#xD;
      overwhelming number of influenza cases, and COVID-19 increases this concern. As in previous&#xD;
      years, the flu vaccine is free at the point of care for people 65 and over. New this year is&#xD;
      that later in the season the vaccine will be made available free at the point of care for&#xD;
      people 50 and over. However, if people refuse to take the vaccine this comprehensive program&#xD;
      cannot benefit public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree to which vaccine hesitancy is expressed varies across characteristics of the&#xD;
      vaccine considered and the time and place it is offered, and across characteristics of the&#xD;
      person's perceptions of complacency, convenience, confidence, calculations, and communal&#xD;
      responsibility, i.e. the &quot;5Cs&quot;. Information campaigns can be used to influence all 5Cs, and&#xD;
      public facing information is often a necessary component of public health campaigns that may&#xD;
      also include structural components. Largely, information campaigns can be viewed as a type of&#xD;
      educational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational interventions may fall short of what is needed to alter people's intentions to&#xD;
      vaccinate where they focus on system 1 rational thinking processes and neglect system 2&#xD;
      automatic thinking processes. To be more effective, public health messages must be tailored&#xD;
      to align with the &quot;beliefs, attitudes, and motivations&quot; of the very people they intend to&#xD;
      influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fact-led educational interventions to increase parents' intentions to vaccinate their&#xD;
      children are particularly ineffective where more subtle content opposes the recipient's&#xD;
      deep-seated values. In a different context, recycling behaviour, previous research&#xD;
      demonstrated that messages aligned with people's deep-seated values (i.e. the moral&#xD;
      foundations that underlie political ideologies) are more likely to promote desired&#xD;
      behavioural intentions than unaligned messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research expands the scope of previous research in two ways. First, rather than&#xD;
      investigating parental attitudes towards vaccination, the investigators will look at people's&#xD;
      intentions to self-vaccinate. Second, the investigators will explore the effectiveness of&#xD;
      messages aligned with the moral foundations that underlie individual's political ideologies&#xD;
      on their intentions to be vaccinated.&#xD;
