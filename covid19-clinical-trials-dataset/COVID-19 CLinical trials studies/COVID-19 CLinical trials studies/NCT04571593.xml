  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this application is to collect survey data indicating the effects of a digital&#xD;
      Yoga Nidra practice on anxiety and sleep during COVID-19. We will explore effects on&#xD;
      momentary anxiousness, as well as on sleep. Participants will be consented through REDCap&#xD;
      during the Yoga Nidra class, then asked to complete an intake form, a sleep questionnaire&#xD;
      (composed of questions from the Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ)) and a pre/post State Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety (STAI) Index, surrounding the practice. Participants will receive an email the next&#xD;
      morning, inquiring about their sleep (~2 min survey), and again the following week, the&#xD;
      morning of the Yoga Nidra class, in order to remind them about the weekly class offering and&#xD;
      also to collect sleep data for a night that did not include pre-bed Yoga Nidra. We will&#xD;
      additionally report feasibility measures including enrollment, retention, qualitative&#xD;
      feedback, and challenges of using the digital platform. Using this data, we will gain&#xD;
      valuable feasibility data for implementation of this type of mind-body practice using digital&#xD;
      platforms. We will also gain important data on the effects of this practice on anxiety and&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will voluntarily complete a ~30-minute remote Yoga Nidra practice, synchronously (through Zoom Wednesdays at 10 pm ET) or asynchronously (through YouTube, using the Zoom recording, any time they like).&#xD;
They may voluntarily repeat this practice as often as they like. Recordings are updated weekly, to reflect the ongoing Zoom class. Yoga Nidra scripts from Satyananda Saraswati's &quot;Yoga Nidra&quot; book (1976) are used for this class.</description>
