  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the epidemiological and clinical features of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with COVID-19 in Kazakhstan at the onset of the pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of data available on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kazakhstan. While a global effort in search for&#xD;
      effective treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 is in effect, it is important that high&#xD;
      quality and up-to-date information be available from a broad variety of populations on the&#xD;
      dynamics of infection. This is especially important in regions where, due to resource&#xD;
      shortage, epidemiologic surveillance may have gaps. To address the current gaps, medical&#xD;
      records will be obtained for patients with confirmed COVID-19 during the first months of the&#xD;
      pandemic (February-April 2020). The epidemiologic and clinical features including the&#xD;
      demographics, clinical manifestation, laboratory parameters, radiologic assessments and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will be analyzed. The results of this study will facilitate the clinical&#xD;
      management of COVID-19 patients in Kazakhstan and ultimately inform the ongoing efforts to&#xD;
      curb the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the&#xD;
      region.&#xD;

        Medical records will be obtained for all subjects, who presented with COVID-19-like&#xD;
        symptoms or had a suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between Feb 20 and April 30, 2020 as&#xD;
        reported to the Republican Centre for Health Development by regional hospitals. Only those&#xD;
        patients who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result will be included in the analysis of&#xD;
        primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
