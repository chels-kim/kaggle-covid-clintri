    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational retrospective cohort study that aims to study the&#xD;
      morphological characteristics of the lung parenchyma of SARS-CoV2 positive patients&#xD;
      identifiable in patterns through artificial intelligence techniques and their impact on&#xD;
      patient outcome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In February, the first case of SARS-CoV2 positive patient was recorded in Lombardy (Italy), a&#xD;
      virus capable of causing a severe form of acute respiratory failure called Coronavirus&#xD;
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative assessments of lung morphology have been identified to describe macroscopic&#xD;
      characteristics of this infection upon admission and during the hospitalization of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment, there are no studies that have exhaustively described the parenchymal lung&#xD;
      damage induced by SARS-CoV2 by quantitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that specific morphological and quantitative alterations of&#xD;
      the lung parenchyma assessed by means of CT scan in patients suffering from severe&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency induced by SARS-CoV2 may have an impact on the severity of the&#xD;
      degree of alteration of the respiratory exchanges (oxygenation and clearance of the CO2) and&#xD;
      have an impact on patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of characteristic lung morphological patterns assessed by CT scan could allow&#xD;
      the recognition of specific patient clusters who can benefit from intensive treatment&#xD;
      differently, making a significant contribution to stratifying the severity of patients and&#xD;
      their risk of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory clinical descriptive study of lung CT images in a completely new&#xD;
      patient population who are nucleic acid amplification test confirmed SARS-CoV2 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE (n. patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect all patients with the inclusion criteria; a total of 500 patients are&#xD;
      expected to be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 80 patients will be enrolled for each local experimental center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following patient data will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood gas analytical data assigned to the CT scan, checks performed upon entering the&#xD;
           hospital, at the time of performing the CT scan, admission to intensive care and 7 days&#xD;
           after entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient characteristics such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of organ dysfunction with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory data relating to hospital admission and symptoms prior to hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ventilator and hemodynamic parameters upon entering the hospital, at the time of&#xD;
           carrying out the CT scan, upon admission to intensive care and 7 days after entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The machine learning approach of lung CT scan analysis will aim at evaluating:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative and qualitative lung alterations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The stratification of such morphological characteristics in specific morphological lung&#xD;
           clusters identified by the means of artificial intelligence using deep learning&#xD;
           algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung CT scan images will be collected and anonymized. Images will be subsequently sent by&#xD;
      University of Milano-Bicocca Institutional google drive account to the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and the Department of Radiology&#xD;
      in a deidentified format for advanced quantitative analysis taking advantage of artificial&#xD;
      intelligence using deep learning algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected in a pseudo-anonymous way through paper Case Report Form (CRF) and&#xD;
      analyzed by the scientific coordinator of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the retrospective nature of the study and in the presence of technical difficult in&#xD;
      obtaining an informed consent of patients in this period of pandemic emergency, informed&#xD;
      consent will be waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median and interquartile&#xD;
      range, according to data distribution that will be evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be expressed as proportions (frequency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep learning segmentation algorithm will segment the lung parenchyma from the entire CT&#xD;
      lung. Lung volume, lung weight and opacity intensity distribution analysis will be applied.&#xD;
      Second, clustering analysis to stratify the patients will be performed. Both an intensity and&#xD;
      a spatial clustering algorithm will be tested. Third, a model will be trained to predict the&#xD;
      injury progression using the images and all other patient data. Statistical significance will&#xD;
      be considered in the presence of a p&lt;0.05 (two-tailed).&#xD;
