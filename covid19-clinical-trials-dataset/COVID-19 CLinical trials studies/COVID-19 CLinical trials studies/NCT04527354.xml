    <textblock>
      The innovative drug Treamid is planned for use in the rehabilitation of patients after&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia in a pilot, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Phase II clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of Treamid, tablets, 50 mg in&#xD;
      patients with fibrotic changes in the lungs after COVID-19 pneumonia during a 28-day&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Treamid tablet, 50 mg in&#xD;
      change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and/or diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide&#xD;
      (DLCO) at Week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of Treamid tablet, 50 mg and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      12-15 Russian centers are planned for participation in this pilot study. The study consists&#xD;
      of three periods: screening (2 weeks), treatment period (4 weeks) and follow-up period (2&#xD;
      weeks after completion of treatment with Treamid / Placebo). The duration of participation in&#xD;
      the study for each patient is no more than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients with fibrotic changes in the lungs after COVID-19 pneumonia are planned to be&#xD;
      randomized. All patients will undergo a qualitative determination of coronavirus severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated using the Modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale,&#xD;
      chest computed tomography (CT), spirometry and body plethysmography with determination of&#xD;
      DLCO. This examination should be conducted as close as possible to the expected randomization&#xD;
      date (no earlier than 5 days before). All eligible patients will be randomized into 2 groups&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio: Treamid 50 mg daily (30 patients); Placebo (30 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period (4 weeks), patients will receive 1 tablet Treamid / Placebo once&#xD;
      a day. Patients will be advised to continue the standard program of medical rehabilitation&#xD;
      under day inpatient or outpatient conditions (stage 3 according to the Interim Guidelines for&#xD;
      Medical Rehabilitation after New Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19), 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will visit the study center once a week. At the Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3 visits,&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant therapy, investigational drug registration, body weight,&#xD;
      vital signs and Oxygen saturation (SpO2) scores, mMRC dyspnea score and spirometry will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Week 2 visit, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC) and biochemical blood test, PK study, common urine analysis, bodyplethysmography&#xD;
      with DLCO will also be conducted. Patients will complete the KBILD questionnaire. Also, the&#xD;
      patients will undergo a 6-minute walk test to measure the distance the patient walks for 6&#xD;
      minutes and evaluate using the Borg Scale. At the Week 4 visit (the end of the therapy),&#xD;
      registration of AEs and concomitant therapy, physical examination, measurement of height,&#xD;
      body weight, vital signs and SpO2, ECG, CBC and biochemical blood tests, PK study and common&#xD;
      urine analysis will be conducted. Patients will be evaluated using the mMRC Dyspnea Scale,&#xD;
      chest CT, spirometry and body plethysmography with determination of DLCO. Patients will&#xD;
      complete the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire (KBILD) followed by a&#xD;
      6-minute walk test to measure the distance the patient walks for 6 minutes and evaluate using&#xD;
      the Borg Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up will continue for another 2 weeks. At the Week 6 visit, registration of AEs&#xD;
      and concomitant therapy, physical examination, measurement of height, body weight, vital&#xD;
      signs and SpO2, ECG, mMRC dyspnea score, CBC and biochemical blood tests, and common urine&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
