  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of May 26, 2020, 5,508,904 confirmed cases (145,279 in France) of COVID-19 and 346,508&#xD;
      deaths (28,457 in France) have been reported since December 8, 2019 worldwide. The rapid&#xD;
      increase in the number of cases in our territory caused France to pass to level 3 of the&#xD;
      epidemic on March 14, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of this disease is still poorly understood, particularly in patients&#xD;
      infected with HIV, patients considered to be at higher risk for severe forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the seroprevalence in the population of people living with HIV will make it possible&#xD;
      to better understand the Covid infection in immunocompromised patients, know the percentage&#xD;
      of immunization and the persistence or not of the antibodies over time, specify the&#xD;
      protective nature or not of these antibodies detected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, very little data is available in HIV-infected patients with Sars-Cov-2 infection.&#xD;
      Only 11 cases of HIV patients with confirmed Sars-Cov-2 infection have been described in the&#xD;
      literature. These patients are under 50 years of age, HIV infection with a controlled viral&#xD;
      load in 8/11, 2 patients with a severe course requiring administration of tociluzumab,&#xD;
      including one patient who died. In addition, the management of these HIV patients is not&#xD;
      codified. Some authors have changed antiretroviral therapy to a protease inhibitor such as&#xD;
      lopinavir or darunavir because of encouraging results in vitro but debated in patients. This&#xD;
      clearly illustrates the disparity of approaches and the lack of data in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the seroprevalence in the population of people living with HIV will allow us to&#xD;
      better understand the Covid-19 infection in immunocompromised patients, know the percentage&#xD;
      of immunization and the persistence or not of the antibodies over time as well as their&#xD;
      unknown neutralizing effect. until now. No data exist on seroprevalence in the HIV&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological tests can detect the immune response to COVID-19 in serum. Studies to date have&#xD;
      shown seroconversion typically within two weeks of symptom onset, with notable differences&#xD;
      depending on the studies, techniques and epitopes of the antigens chosen to detect the&#xD;
      antibodies. A study which showed that the seropositivity rate reached 50% on the 11th day and&#xD;
      100% on the 39th day with a seroconversion time of 11, 12 and 14 days in median for the total&#xD;
      antibodies, IgM and IgG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major public health issue. Serological tests are&#xD;
      currently being developed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, performed on blood samples, can&#xD;
      be performed in an automated manner and provide an estimate of the level of circulating&#xD;
      antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These serological tests could identify patients who have developed immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and&#xD;
      be useful in the collection of epidemiological data related to COVID-19 or to know the&#xD;
      serological status of exposed persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus and the antibody response (quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative) in COVID-19 patients is largely unknown and that of patients of HIV patients&#xD;
      completely unknown to date. The relevance of the use of serological tests in clinical&#xD;
      practice will indeed depend on the prior availability of physiopathological and clinical&#xD;
      knowledge allowing their interpretation and ensuring adequate indications such as those&#xD;
      recently proposed by the Haute Autorité de Santé ((https: //www.has&#xD;
      -sante.fr/jcms/p_3182370/fr/premieres-indications-pour-les-tests-serologiques-du-covid-19, #&#xD;
      9268)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies to date have shown seroconversion typically within two weeks of symptom onset, with&#xD;
      notable differences depending on the studies, techniques and epitopes of the antigens chosen&#xD;
      to detect the antibodies. A study which showed that the seropositivity rate reached 50% on&#xD;
      the 11th day and 100% on the 39th day with a seroconversion time of 11, 12 and 14 days in&#xD;
      median for the total antibodies, IgM and IgG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the immune response does not always mean protective immunization against further&#xD;
      infection with the same virus. Only so-called neutralizing antibodies can obtain such&#xD;
      protection. But the titer of neutralizing antibody needed to provide protection is still&#xD;
      unknown for SARS-CoV-2. To date, the target epitopes of neutralizing antibodies have not yet&#xD;
      been identified. In addition, data demonstrating protective immunity against COVID-19 induced&#xD;
      by antibodies produced against SARS-CoV-2 are currently very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Chinese study that studied the antibody response in 175 patients with mild forms of&#xD;
      COVID-19 found that 30% of them had low neutralizing antibody titer at the end of&#xD;
      hospitalization. Differences in the titer of neutralizing antibodies were observed depending&#xD;
      on the age of the patients, the oldest (40-59 and 60-85 years) having higher titers than the&#xD;
      youngest (15-39 years). The titers remained stable on a control two weeks later (47/175&#xD;
      patients). This study raises the question of the protection of the duration of this&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why it is essential to characterize in depth the prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 infection&#xD;
      in patients infected with HIV, patients considered to be at high risk of severe forms, and&#xD;
      the evolution of antibody production according to the evolution of the epidemic and their&#xD;
      protective role over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no specific treatment or therapeutic strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness for&#xD;
      COVID-19. Some antiretrovirals such as lopinavir / ritonavir, with in vitro activity on&#xD;
      Sars-Cov-2, have been tested in real life with discordant results. It will be interesting to&#xD;
      look at the antiretroviral treatments of patients who have had a Covid compared to those&#xD;
      seronegative in serology.&#xD;
