      This study is an observational study (Non-interventional study) to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of favipiravir in patients older than 15 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      initiated treatment with favipiravir before enrollment to the study. Patients who have&#xD;
      already had a routine favipiravir treatment decision or alternatively favipiravir treatment&#xD;
      started at the time of enrollment, will be included in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The clinical picture of 2019-nCoV disease is in a broad spectrum, which includes asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, and even severe&#xD;
      viral pneumonia with death. Although the mortality rate is not yet clear, the reported&#xD;
      case-fatality risk was 11-14% during the initial studies which included patients with severe&#xD;
      disease. The overall case fatality rate was reported as approximately 2%. In addition, most&#xD;
      cases have resulted in a pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy and ventilator&#xD;
      support. The alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19 caused a global emergency and&#xD;
      this outbreak has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested that investigational product favipiravir can improve the recovery of&#xD;
      patients with mild disease and reduce the treatment duration from less than 11 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety data for favipiravir use in&#xD;
      the Turkish patient cohort diagnosed with COVID-19 and decided to be treated with&#xD;
      &quot;Favipiravir&quot; before enrollment to this observational study. This study is designed as an&#xD;
      observational drug study which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in&#xD;
      patients and diagnosed with COVID-19 and older than 15 years of age.&#xD;

      This study is designed as an observational drug study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      favipiravir in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and older than 15 years of age with a&#xD;
      favipiravir treatment decision. Patients who have already had a routine favipiravir treatment&#xD;
      decision or favipiravir treatment started will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1000 female and male patients aged 15 years or older will be included in the&#xD;
      study. The planned observation duration for each patient is 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 14 sites.&#xD;
