      This is a Phase 1/2, single-center, randomized, open-label, non-controlled trial.&#xD;

      the following three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Vaccination twice at 2-week intervals (n = 10) Group B: Vaccination twice at 4-week&#xD;
      intervals (n = 10) Group C: Vaccination 3 times at 2-week intervals (n = 10)&#xD;
