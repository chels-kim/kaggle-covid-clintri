  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of a multi-faceted,&#xD;
      multi-modal hand hygiene strategy (Five Moments for Hand Hygiene) to improve hand hygiene&#xD;
      compliance among healthcare staff. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has&#xD;
      rapidly spread globally. The novel coronavirus is characterized by rapid human-to-human&#xD;
      transmission. Hand washing is a part of measures recommended by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19.The purpose of this study was to use adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (ATP) testing and direct observation for improving hand hygiene and compliance&#xD;
      in nurse.&#xD;

    <description>The 3M™ Clean-Trace™ Surface ATP test is a single-use test device that contains a swab for the collection of a sample from a surface. The swab is pre-moistened with a cationic agent to aid in the collection of soil and the release of Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP) from intact cells.Upon activation of the test, reagent in the cuvette of the test device reacts with ATP collected on the swab to produce light.The intensity of the light is proportional to the amount of ATP and therefore the degree of contamination. Measurement of the light requires the use of a 3M™ Clean-Trace™ NG Luminometer and the results are displayed in Relative Light Units (RLU).ATP is an indicator of organic residues and microorganisms. Detection of ATP is used to rapidly assess the standards of hygiene and sanitation procedures for surfaces and equipment.</description>
