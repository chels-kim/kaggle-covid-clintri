    <textblock>
      A prospective, controlled, randomized, multicenter study whose goal is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of an autophagy inhibitor (GNS561), an anti-NKG2A (monalizumab) and an anti-C5aR&#xD;
      (avdoralimab) versus standard of care in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have&#xD;
      Sars-CoV-2 infection not eligible to a resuscitation unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to their severity level at the time of enrolment, eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 different cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COHORT 1 (mild symptoms or asymptomatic): GNS561 vs anti-NKG2A vs standard of care&#xD;
           (randomization ratio 1:1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COHORT 2 (moderate/severe symptoms): anti-C5aR vs standard of care (randomization ratio&#xD;
           1:1).&#xD;
