  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a double arm, randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial of&#xD;
      oxaloacetate for treatment of fatigue in women with a history of COVID-19 infection,&#xD;
      resolution of the infection, and remaining fatigue that interfere with everyday activities,&#xD;
      based on use of a standardized questionnaire to screen for impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a 6-week supply of the active or placebo and will be asked to take&#xD;
      one capsule twice a day with water and food. They will be contacted weekly for two weeks by&#xD;
      the study coordinator to assess for any side effects or difficulty taking the medication.&#xD;
      They will be asked to again to complete the standardized questionnaire to screen for&#xD;
      impairment after 2 weeks, and again at the end of the study at 6 weeks. Finally, any adverse&#xD;
      reactions and symptoms will be evaluated once again four weeks later to ensure that any&#xD;
      symptoms that may have been present during treatment have resolved.&#xD;

      We will conduct a double arm, randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial of&#xD;
      oxaloacetate for treatment of fatigue in women with a history of COVID-19 infection,&#xD;
      resolution of the infection, and remaining fatigue that interfere with everyday activities,&#xD;
      based on use of a standardized questionnaire to screen for impairment. Women will be&#xD;
      recruited from a variety of settings including clinics affiliated with our existing doctor&#xD;
      base, outreach through social media and notification of community organizations that serve&#xD;
      this patient population. The study will take place at the residences of the participants,&#xD;
      being performed virtually after receipt of informed consent paperwork, COVID-19 positive test&#xD;
      data, and COVID -19 negative resolution data by us, and by receipt of the test product by the&#xD;
      participant. Efforts will be made to conduct as much of this trial virtually as possible due&#xD;
      to the Covid-19 pandemic. Women who could potentially be pregnant will undergo pregnancy&#xD;
      testing and determination of menopausal status, if appropriate. Participants will complete&#xD;
      baseline questionnaires that assess fatigue and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the participants will receive a 6-week supply of the active or placebo and will&#xD;
      be asked to take one capsule twice a day with water and food. They will be contacted weekly&#xD;
      for two weeks by the study coordinator to assess for any side effects or difficulty taking&#xD;
      the medication. They will be asked to again to complete the standardized questionnaire to&#xD;
      screen for impairment after 2 weeks, and again at the end of the study at 6 weeks. Finally,&#xD;
      any adverse reactions and symptoms will be evaluated once again four weeks later to ensure&#xD;
      that any symptoms that may have been present during treatment have resolved.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.1 Women with an initial infection diagnosis COVID-19 that has been resolved, as&#xD;
             measured by rRT PCR, who are at least 2 months after proven viral resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.2 No evidence of active/recurrent COVID-19 or other serious chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.3 Have significant fatigue complaints, defined as a bimodal score of 4 or greater&#xD;
             on the Fatigue Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.4 Is geographically accessible, or can fill out forms virtually, and able to&#xD;
             participate in a study of 6-10 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.5 Age &gt;18 years and less than 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.6 Ability to complete evaluation surveys in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.7 The effects of oxaloacetate on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; IUD; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of any age who&#xD;
             have had their ovaries and/or uterus removed will not be at risk for pregnancy and&#xD;
             will not require contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Menopausal status will be established as follows: Women who are 55 years or older&#xD;
                  and who are not menstruating will be considered postmenopausal and not at risk&#xD;
                  for pregnancy. Women who are less than 55 years old who are menstruating will be&#xD;
                  considered premenopausal and will require contraception. Women who are less than&#xD;
                  55 years with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not menstruating and have not&#xD;
                  had a menstrual period within the past 2 years will have an FSH and estradiol&#xD;
                  measured. If the values are in postmenopausal range the woman will be considered&#xD;
                  postmenopausal and she will not be considered at risk for pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.8 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.9 No diagnosis of Clinical Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.1.10 Is not taking an oxaloacetate supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.2.1 Has another serious or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that contributes&#xD;
             to substantial physical or emotional disability that would detract from participating&#xD;
             in the planned study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.2.2 Taking chronic medications that would interfere with cognitive functioning such&#xD;
             as medications for sleep, anxiety, narcotics for pain, use of illicit medical foods or&#xD;
             cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.2.3 Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.2.4 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to oxaloacetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.2.5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection of Covid-19 or other virus, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4.2.6 Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because the safety&#xD;
             of oxaloacetate in this setting is unknown. A pregnancy test will be performed on all&#xD;
             women with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not determined to be postmenopausal,&#xD;
             as described in section 4.1.7.&#xD;
