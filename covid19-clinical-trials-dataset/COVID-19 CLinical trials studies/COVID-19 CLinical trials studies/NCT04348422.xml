      The 2019-20 coronavirus disease, caused by COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic. The measures in&#xD;
      which public health officials quarantine confirmed and isolate symptomatic cases in order to&#xD;
      reduce the spread COVID-19 is the common practice used in most countries. However, a&#xD;
      significant question remains in regards to the asymptomatically infected individuals, which&#xD;
      may propagate the virus and impede infection control. The other question to consider is&#xD;
      whether these asymptomatic carriers develop an immune response or continue viral shedding.&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is the evaluate the immune response, i.e developing&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the asymptomatic cases, in a household study design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2019-20 coronavirus disease, caused by COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic. The outbreak&#xD;
      started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Up to Apr 9. 2020 there are more than 1.4&#xD;
      million confirmed cases, and over 82,000 deaths 1. In Israel, COVID-19 was confirmed in more&#xD;
      9,000 cases and took the life of 70 victims (09.04.2020) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the extensive outbreak of COVID-19, a mass of studies with a large population have been&#xD;
      reported. Wu et al. found that the mean R0 of COVID-19 was approximately 2.68(95% CI:&#xD;
      2.47-2.86) . The measures in which public health officials quarantine confirmed and isolate&#xD;
      symptomatic cases in order to reduce the spread COVID-19 is the common practice used in most&#xD;
      countries. However, a significant question remains in regards to the asymptomatically&#xD;
      infected individuals, which may propagate the virus and impede infection control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem To date, initial surveillance has focused primarily on patients with severe&#xD;
      disease, and, as such, the full spectrum of the disease. The extent of asymptomatic disease&#xD;
      is not clear. Mizumoto et al. mathematical model suggested 17.9-33.3% are asymptomatic&#xD;
      carriers. The other question to consider is whether these asymptomatic carriers develop an&#xD;
      immune response or continue viral shedding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the causative viral agent of the disease COVID-19, is a coronavirus which bears&#xD;
      the transmembrane glycoprotein spikes (S protein) typical of viruses in its clade. The spikes&#xD;
      on SARS-CoV-2 allows the virus to enter host cells through the human receptor angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), present in alveolar epithelial cells. These spikes are a&#xD;
      prominent target of human immune responses and have been found to be highly immunogenic and&#xD;
      induce antibody production. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein is&#xD;
      particularly targeted by neutralizing antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic test in symptomatic patients is based on real time polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (RT-PCR), which tests the existence of specific COVID-19 genes in the sample. However, there&#xD;
      are growing numbers of reports of false negative results due to improper sample collection,&#xD;
      low viral load or technical instability of the PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology test aims to detect antibodies (immunoglobulin M - IgM, immunoglobulin G- IgG,&#xD;
      immunoglobulin A - IgA) in the patient's' blood, i.e. the patient's immune response. The IgM&#xD;
      antibodies usually show within 3-7 days from symptoms, whereas IgG antibodies follow within&#xD;
      10-14 days. Diseases which involve the respiratory tract usually cause elevation of IgA as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zhao et al. have recently published data indicating that COVID-19 patients show typical&#xD;
      antibody production times in response to acute viral infection with SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the&#xD;
      data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection follows a seroconversion timeline similar to other&#xD;
      viral infections. In their sample of 173 of hospitalized symptomatic confirmed patients,&#xD;
      93.1% (161/173) developed antibodies, where 82.7% developed IgM antibodies and 64.7%&#xD;
      developed IgG antibodies. Importantly, all of these patients suffered from symptoms. The&#xD;
      association between symptoms level, viral load and the immune response is yet to be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed settings, such as households, have a defined population that may not mix readily with&#xD;
      the larger surrounding community, and therefore such settings can provide a strategic way to&#xD;
      track emerging respiratory infections and characterize virus transmission patterns because&#xD;
      the denominator can be well defined. Also, exposure is within the setting, and follow-up of&#xD;
      household contacts is generally more feasible in this well-defined setting as compared to an&#xD;
      undefined one. Following close contacts with similar levels of exposure to infection from&#xD;
      primary cases can also permit identification of the asymptomatic fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our solution The purpose of the current study is the evaluate the immune response, i.e&#xD;
      developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the asymptomatic cases, in a household study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to evaluate over 1000 patients with positive COVID-19 results and their households.&#xD;
      The plan includes evaluation of their symptoms, viral load and immune response every 10 days&#xD;
      in a period of 12 weeks. Next, Analysis of the cause of the immune response differences&#xD;
      between subjects by sequencing their DNA and most importantly of the ACE2 gene - the receptor&#xD;
      the virus attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will shed the needed light on the connection between symptoms, viral load and immune&#xD;
      response. The association between viral load, symptoms and immune response will enable:&#xD;
      monitor disease progress, predict patients who are at high risk to develop severe symptoms,&#xD;
      determine immunity to the virus and most importantly locate the chronic carriers which do not&#xD;
      develop immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Following a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR result in the Shamir medical center lab, the&#xD;
      subject will be contacted by telephone and will be offered to participate in the study. Upon&#xD;
      consent, medical staff will arrive to the subject's house and further explain the details of&#xD;
      the study and ask for an informed consent of the subject and any of the households over 18&#xD;
      years old. Upon signing an informed consent, each of the subject will fill a symptoms report&#xD;
      and provide an oropharyngeal swab and blood sample (10-20cc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 10 days within 12 weeks, a researcher will visit the subjects house, and repeat the&#xD;
      procedure (symptoms questionnaire, blood withdrawal and oropharyngeal swab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the last evaluation (12th week), every 4-8 weeks within 1 year, a researcher will&#xD;
      visit the subjects hosue and perform filling of symptoms questionnaire and blood withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology kits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NADAL COVID-19 IgG/Igm (Nal Von Minden)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. COVID-19 IgM/IgG (DIA PRO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA (IBL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2019-NCoV IgM/IgG (MAGLUMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immunocomb (BioGal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (EuroImmun) Rt-PCR kit RT-PCR will be performed using 3 primers and 3&#xD;
           probes in addition to one human RNase primer and probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arrival to the subjects house&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical staff will use appropriate protective medical gear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood withdrawal for 3 blood tubes (15-20cc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Oropharyngeal swab&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Samples will be kept at 2-8c degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Samples will be returned to Shamir Medical Center lab in 2-8c degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. RT-PCR will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Serology will be performed using the available kits. Each subject will be sampled 9&#xD;
           times (every 10 days within 12 weeks in addition to the first contact).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term evaluation will include Blood sample and questionnaires every 4-8 weeks for 1 year&#xD;
      from the final evaluation (12th week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first evaluation will be completed for both the patient and his/her households&#xD;
           within 1-7 days of receiving the RT-PCR positive result&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Following the first evaluation, each participant will be evaluated every 10 days (±2&#xD;
           days) for 100 days. In total 10 additional times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In summary, each participant will be evaluated 11 times (first evaluation + 10&#xD;
           additional evaluations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following the last evaluation, each participant will be evaluated every 4-8 weeks for 1&#xD;
           year. In total 6-12 times.&#xD;
