  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study of the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (BNT162b2) in Chinese healthy&#xD;
      population. After randomization, the trial for each participant will last for approximately&#xD;
      13 months. Screening period is 2 weeks prior to randomization (Day -14 to Day 0), and two&#xD;
      doses of either SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2) or placebo will be given intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
      separated by 21 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female participants between the ages of 18 and 85 years, inclusive, at&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;

             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy participants who are determined by medical history, physical examination (if&#xD;
             required), and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
             the study. Note: Healthy participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as&#xD;
             disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening&#xD;
             disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving personal signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form and this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SARS-CoV-2 antibody test screening is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative SARS-CoV-2 test in throat swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction (RT-PCR) (only for the first approximately 150 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal in chest computed tomography (CT) scans (no imaging features of coronavirus&#xD;
             disease 2019 (COVID-19), only for the first approximately 150 subjects).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic&#xD;

             administered short term (&lt;14 days) for treatment of an acute illness, participants&#xD;
             should not be enrolled into the study until corticosteroid therapy has been&#xD;
             discontinued for at least 28 days before study intervention administration.&#xD;
             Inhaled/nebulized, intra-articular, intrabursal, or topical (skin or eyes)&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted.&#xD;

             nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or persons tested positive for&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2 within the 30 days prior to Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Travel or live in any country or region with a high SARS-CoV-2 infection risk (as&#xD;
             defined at Screening Visit) within the 14 days prior to Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of COVID-19, e.g., respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath&#xD;
             and breathing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever, defined as axillary temperature â‰¥37.3ÂºC or oral temperature â‰¥38ÂºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of SARS, SARS-CoV-2 or middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) infection.&#xD;
             Suspected SARS patients should be screened for SARS antibodies.&#xD;
