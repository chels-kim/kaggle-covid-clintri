  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of one IM dose&#xD;
      of AZD1222 followed by one IM dose of rAd26-S in adults ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical study, designed to provide data on&#xD;
      the heterologous prime-boost use of AZD1222 and rAd26-S, to be administered one after the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be healthy adults ≥ 18 years of age. They will receive 1 intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) injection of 5×10^10 viral particles (vp) (nominal) of AZD1222 on Day 1 followed by&#xD;
      rAd26-S 1×10^11 viral particles (vp) (nominal) on Day 29 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will remain on study for 6 months (180 days) following the first&#xD;
      vaccination. Safety will be assessed for the duration of the study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Solicited adverse events (AEs; local and systemic) will be assessed for 7 days following&#xD;
           each vaccination (ie, until Day 8 following the first administration and Day 36&#xD;
           following the second administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsolicited AEs will be recorded for 28 days following each vaccination (ie, until Day&#xD;
           29 following the first administration and Day 57 following the second administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from signing of the informed consent form&#xD;
           through Day 180&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity will also be assessed for the duration of the study, including serologic&#xD;
      quantification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      antigen-specific antibody levels and antibody seroconversion rate, neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow to explore the safety and immunogenicity of two different adenovirus&#xD;
      vector vaccines combination, thereby complementing data from other pivotal controlled vaccine&#xD;
      trials in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is going to be conducted in the Republic of Azerbaijan. It is expected that&#xD;
      approximately 100 participants will be included in the study and receive the vaccine.&#xD;
