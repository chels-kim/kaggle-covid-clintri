      This study aims to understand the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress amongst&#xD;
      migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, there are an estimated 164 million migrant workers. Although studies have&#xD;
      documented how migrant workers have an increased risk of adverse mental and physical health&#xD;
      outcomes, little is known about their vulnerability during a health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current COVID-19 outbreak, nearly 30,000 migrant workers have been infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore. This represents 9 in 10 of the local cases, and 25 dormitories have&#xD;
      been gazetted to contain the spread of the virus. Correspondingly, these measures have placed&#xD;
      a spotlight on the mental well-being of migrant workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research protocol, the investigators propose to administer a survey to understand the&#xD;
      prevalence and predictors of psychological distress amongst migrant workers in Singapore.&#xD;
      This will allow the investigators to capture the base rate of depression, anxiety, and stress&#xD;
      symptoms in the population, and will also help to identify risk factors of psychological&#xD;
      distress within this population.&#xD;
