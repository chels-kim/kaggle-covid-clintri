  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT-P59 is a monoclonal antibody targeted against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a treatment for SARS&#xD;
      CoV 2 infection. CT-P59 is currently being developed by the Sponsor as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, safety, tolerability and virology of CT-P59 will be&#xD;
      evaluated in patient with mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.&#xD;
