  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national multicenter prospective observational study led by the GIMEMA. The&#xD;
      GIMEMA-ALLIANCE Platform is also an online monitoring system for patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies aiming at helping hematologists in the early recognition and timely management&#xD;
      of problems of their patients. Based on patient's rating of specific items (i.e. on the&#xD;
      presence of clinically relevant problems or problems with adherence to therapy or risk of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection), the Platform will automatically send alerts to the treating&#xD;
      hematologist (and/or appointed members of the local Team). Physicians will be free to make&#xD;
      any action they feel appropriate for the best care of their patients.&#xD;
