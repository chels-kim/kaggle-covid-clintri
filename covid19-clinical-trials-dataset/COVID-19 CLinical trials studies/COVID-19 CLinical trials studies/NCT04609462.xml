  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label randomized controlled multicenter phase II trial will evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      impact of the use of HFNC vs. conventional oxygen therapy in patients with moderate and&#xD;
      severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition in which rapid-onset impairment in gas&#xD;
      exchange between the lungs and the blood, lead to hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia.&#xD;
      Usual management of this condition relies on oxygen supplementation throughout different&#xD;
      respiratory support modalities (i.e., low flow oxygen devices, high-flow nasal cannulas,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, ECMO, etc.) aiming to restore gas exchange and to support respiratory&#xD;
      effort. In most cases, initial management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure might be&#xD;
      provided through low-flow oxygen systems, but more severe cases will require more advanced&#xD;
      life-supporting strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory compromise by SARS-CoV-2 infection widely varies between subjects. Thus,&#xD;
      respiratory system elastance, intrapulmonary shunt, pulmonary perfusion/ventilation&#xD;
      inequalities and lung weight can range between almost normal up to very high values.&#xD;
      Consequently, modalities to provide initial support in acute severe hypoxemic respiratory&#xD;
      failure in SARS-CoV-2 infection should not be limited to immediate invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation support as such respiratory support modalities should be adapted to individual&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, similar values of initial PaO2/FiO2 ratios (especially when PaO2/FiO2 ratio is&#xD;
      &lt; 200) are not clearly related with more or less severe lung affectation, high or low&#xD;
      respiratory system elastance patterns, high or low adaptive hypoxic vasoconstriction, and far&#xD;
      beyond clinical signs, there are no widely available methods able to rapidly decide which&#xD;
      patients would be more benefit from a relative &quot;conservative&quot; management or on the contrary,&#xD;
      which patient would benefit from immediate invasive respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from different&#xD;
      etiologies has rapidly increased during the last years. Certainly, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials suggest that HFNC might prevent intubation and the need for invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in patients with moderate and severe hypoxemia. Nevertheless, impact of HFNC on&#xD;
      mortality rates and other important clinical outcomes in this condition remains&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial observational reports of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection subjected to&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation showed a consistent and very high mortality. Indeed, some&#xD;
      experts claimed for using such non-invasive respiratory support devices in patients with&#xD;
      moderate or even high pulmonary shunt values arguing about possible harm induced by&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation especially in patients with a relative normal respiratory system&#xD;
      elastance. Nevertheless, others recommended against HFNC use because safety concerns for&#xD;
      health care workers, which clearly limited its use at the initial phases of the pandemic.&#xD;
      Thus, the impact and safety of using HFNC at very early stages of acute hypoxemic respiratory&#xD;
      failure induced by severe SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. This is how the&#xD;
      HiFlo-COVID trial propose to assess the impact HFNC vs. conventional oxygen therapy on the&#xD;
      need for intubation / invasive mechanical ventilation support and the clinical status (at&#xD;
      days-14 and -28) as assessed by a modified 7-point ordinal scale in patients with moderate /&#xD;
      severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
