      The hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 are related with disease progression, severity and&#xD;
      mortality. The Objective of our study is to evaluate the role of hematological parameters in&#xD;
      determination of COVID-19 disease severity.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus involves respiratory as well as other body systems including cardiovascular,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, neurological, immunological and hematopoietic system. Patient of covid-19&#xD;
      pneumonia presents with wide range of hemostatic abnormalities. These hemostatic&#xD;
      abnormalities in COVID-19 are related with disease progression, severity and mortality. The&#xD;
      Objective of our study is to evaluate the role of hematological parameters in determination&#xD;
      of COVID-19 disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a retrospective study, conducted in Department of Pathology and Department of&#xD;
      medicine, FMH college of Medicine and Dentistry from May 2020 to July 2020. Total of 101,&#xD;
      confirmed cases of covid-19 disease, both genders between 17 to 75-year age were included.&#xD;
      Hematological parameters were compared in mild, moderate, severe and critical disease group.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were analyzed by using non parametric, Kruskal Wallis test while&#xD;
      categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test.&#xD;
