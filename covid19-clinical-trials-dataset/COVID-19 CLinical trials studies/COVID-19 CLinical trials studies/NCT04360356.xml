      Research Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province,&#xD;
      China. An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due&#xD;
      to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred and the disease, now&#xD;
      termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China and all over the world.&#xD;
      A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV,&#xD;
      was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease.&#xD;
      The causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded&#xD;
      positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV).&#xD;

      Selected Drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin has anti-parasitic effect along with anti-viral activity against a broad range of&#xD;
      viruses in vitro. Ivermectin was identified as an inhibitor of interaction between the human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) α/β1&#xD;
      heterodimer responsible for IN nuclear import. Ivermectin has since been confirmed to inhibit&#xD;
      HIV-1 replication. Importantly, Ivermectin has been demonstrated to limit infection by RNA&#xD;
      viruses such as West Nile Virus and influenza. This broad-spectrum activity is believed to be&#xD;
      due to the reliance by many different RNA viruses on IMPα/β1 during infection. Ivermectin has&#xD;
      similarly been shown to be effective against the DNA virus pseudorabies virus (PRV) both in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo. Finally, Ivermectin was the focus of a phase III clinical trial in&#xD;
      Thailand against DENV infection, in which a single daily oral dose was observed to be safe&#xD;
      and resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of viral NS1 protein, but no change&#xD;
      in viremia or clinical benefit was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded&#xD;
      positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies on SARS-CoV proteins have revealed a potential role for&#xD;
      IMPα/β1 during infection in signal-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shutting of the SARS-CoV&#xD;
      nucleocapsid protein that may impact host cell division. In addition, the SARS-CoV accessory&#xD;
      protein ORF6 has been shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of the STAT1 transcription&#xD;
      factor by sequestering IMPα/β1 on the rough ER/Golgi membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these reports suggested that Ivermectin's nuclear transport inhibitory&#xD;
      activity may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, it has been postulated that the&#xD;
      FDA-approved drug Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro whereas a single&#xD;
      treatment was able to provoke approximately 5000-fold reduction in viral load within 48h.&#xD;
      Ivermectin has an established safety profile for human use. Recent reviews and meta-analysis&#xD;
      indicate that high dose Ivermectin has comparable safety as the standard low-dose treatment,&#xD;
      although there is not enough evidence to make conclusion about the safety profile in&#xD;
      pregnancy. In clinical setting, Ivermectin was the focus of a phase III clinical trial on&#xD;
      patients with dengue viral infection in Thailand, in which a single daily dose (200 - 400&#xD;
      µg/kg once daily for 2 days in one arm and 200-400 µg/kg once daily for 3 days in the other&#xD;
      arm) was found to be safe but did not produce any clinical benefit. In previous clinical&#xD;
      study, one dose of Ivermectin 200 μg/kg or four doses of Ivermectin 200 μg/kg (given on days&#xD;
      1, 2, 15, and 16) for the treatment of non-disseminated strongyloidiasis were implicated. The&#xD;
      author proposed that, multiple doses of Ivermectin did not show higher efficacy and was&#xD;
      tolerated less than a single dose. A single dose should, therefore, be preferred for the&#xD;
      treatment of non-disseminated strongyloidiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide is originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent and has a broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antiviral activity undergoing development for the treatment of influenza and other viral&#xD;
      respiratory infections. In addition to its antiviral activity, Nitazoxanide inhibits the&#xD;
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nitazoxanide could improve outcomes in patients infected&#xD;
      with MERS-CoV by suppressing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6.&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide has been tested in clinical setting for the treatment of acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      influenza, where the subjects received either 600 or 300 mg of Nitazoxanide or placebo orally&#xD;
      twice daily for five days and were followed for 28 days. Subjects who received Nitazoxanide&#xD;
      600 mg twice daily experienced shorter times to alleviation of symptoms compared with&#xD;
      subjects who received 300 mg Nitazoxanide twice daily, which in turn, was shorter than&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, there is lack&#xD;
      of effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Nearly all patients who suffered from&#xD;
      COVID-19-associated pneumonia accepted oxygen therapy and WHO recommended extracorporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to patients with refractory hypoxemia. Rescue treatment with&#xD;
      convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G are delivered to some critical cases according to&#xD;
      their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the use of Ivermectin and Nitazoxanide combination for treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
      infected patients is based on the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of the selected&#xD;
      drugs. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in&#xD;
      containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its morphology through&#xD;
      electron microscopy. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID-19 is nucleic acid&#xD;
      detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by&#xD;
      real-time PCR and further confirmation by next-generation sequencing.&#xD;

      Drug interactions of Ivermectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Warfarin and Coumarin Ivermectin may decrease the anticoagulant activities of warfarin&#xD;
           and 4-hydroxycoumarin&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Albendazole The metabolism of Albendazole can be increased when combined with Ivermectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Doxycyline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additive pharmacodynamic effect&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindication of Ivermectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergies towards Ivermectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of Nitazoxanide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most common adverse effects are GIT as nausea and occasional stomach cramps with&#xD;
           mild diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting. Nervous system side effects as headache,&#xD;
           dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, tremor, and hypesthesia have been reported in less than&#xD;
           1% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications of Nitazoxanide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no data on the excretion of Nitazoxanide into human milk. The manufacturer&#xD;
           recommends that caution should be used when administering Nitazoxanide to nursing women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions of Nitazoxanide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tizoxanide (the active metabolite of Nitazoxanide) is highly bound to plasma protein (&gt;&#xD;
           99.9%). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor for adverse reactions when administering&#xD;
           Nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow&#xD;
           therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitazoxanide should be used with caution in patients with significant renal and hepatic&#xD;
           impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic disease COVID-19 is particularly of major importance in Egypt where a heavy&#xD;
      population lives. There is an acute need for comprehensive, continuous, and cost-effective&#xD;
      health care delivery for infected people. Early detection and strategies for prevention of&#xD;
      progression of COVID-19 would make a major difference for these patients and would also be&#xD;
      economically beneficial for a resource-constrained country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug&#xD;
      combination for possible treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This drug combination may&#xD;
      help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through&#xD;
      different goals as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on&#xD;
           its possible activity against COVID-19 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Providing cost-effective and easy-to-implement treatment strategy for infected patients&#xD;
           and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, this clinical strategy remains an important goal in improving Egyptian health&#xD;
           state which can save people life and save a lot of money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of Work&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of work will be conducted through&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of new drug combination of Ivermectin and Nitazoxanide for treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
           infected people. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of&#xD;
           value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the&#xD;
           pathophysiology of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the effect of new drug combination on the symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
           COVID-19 patients according to WHO (Clinical management of severe acute respiratory&#xD;
           infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected) interim guidance published at 13&#xD;
           March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigating the impact of new drug combination on the prevention of severe&#xD;
           compilations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
