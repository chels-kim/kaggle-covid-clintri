    <textblock>
      This expanded access protocol will enroll subjects with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      confirmed by laboratory testing and who are in critical condition as indicated by life&#xD;
      support measurements. Eligible subjects will receive open-label intravenous administration of&#xD;
      investigational product (CAP-1002) containing 150 million allogeneic Cardiosphere-Derived&#xD;
      Cells (CDCs). CAP-1002 administration will be conducted at the investigative site on Day 1&#xD;
      and weekly up to a maximum of 4 doses, based on clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete protocol assessments at Screening; Day 1; Weeks 1-3; and Follow-up by&#xD;
      phone 30 and 90 days after the last infusion. Baseline assessments will be conducted prior to&#xD;
      first infusion on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be observed during the lengths of hospitalization and monitored for outcome&#xD;
      and safety. Safety and outcome data will be collected and reported at the conclusion of&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol that will enroll subjects with clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection confirmed by laboratory testing and who are in critical condition as&#xD;
      indicated by life support measurements. Prior to protocol procedures, informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative. Subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      screening evaluation to determine eligibility based on the protocol inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive open-label intravenous administration of investigational&#xD;
      product (CAP-1002) containing 150 million allogeneic Cardiosphere-Derived Cells (CDCs).&#xD;
      CAP-1002 administration will be conducted at the investigative site on Day 1 and weekly up to&#xD;
      a maximum of 4 doses, based on clinical course. Starting at the second CAP-1002&#xD;
      administration and at all subsequent administrations, medications may be administered to the&#xD;
      subject at the Investigator's discretion based on the pre-treatment guidelines provided by&#xD;
      Capricor and/or institutional protocols to minimize the risk of potential severe allergic&#xD;
      reactions such as anaphylaxis. Final decisions regarding the pre-treatment medication(s),&#xD;
      dose(s) administered, and route(s) of administration will be determined by the Investigator&#xD;
      taking into consideration the subject's medical status, COVID-19, related conditions,&#xD;
      concomitant medications, and medical history. For any pre-treatment medication administered,&#xD;
      the FDA approved label will be reviewed for information on potential side effects and/or drug&#xD;
      interactions and followed for detailed instructions on weight-based dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete protocol assessments at Screening; Day 1; Weeks 1-3; and Follow-up by&#xD;
      phone 30 and 90 days after the last infusion. Baseline assessments will be conducted prior to&#xD;
      first infusion on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be observed during the lengths of hospitalization and monitored for outcome&#xD;
      and safety with vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, PFTs, clinical laboratory testing&#xD;
      (including CBC, BMP, BNP, CRP, ESR, hsCRP, cytokine assay, viral load/nasal swab), troponin&#xD;
      I/troponin T and transthoracic echocardiogram. Additional CT and/or cardiac MRI imaging may&#xD;
      be performed, as appropriate. Safety and outcome data (including mortality, need for&#xD;
      additional levels of supportive care, length of stay) will be collected and reported at the&#xD;
      conclusion of treatment and follow-up. Additional samples of blood may be collected for&#xD;
      proteomic analysis.&#xD;
