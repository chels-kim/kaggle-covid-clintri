    <textblock>
      An observational study of consecutive patients testing positive for COVID-19 who require&#xD;
      admission to hospital to determine the degree of myocardial injury through biomarkers and&#xD;
      echocardiography and the impact of this on cardiovascular outcomes. The COVID-19 disease and&#xD;
      CARdiac Events study (COVICARE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the prevalence of myocardial injury/impairment in patients hospitalised&#xD;
           with COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the predictive value of baseline biomarkers in identifying patients at high&#xD;
           risk of significant morbidity/mortality due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Novel Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), first&#xD;
      recorded in Hubei Province of Wuhan China in December 2019 has now swept the globe and has&#xD;
      been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest published registry from the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) describes a disease with a broad range of acuity but found from a cohort of 72314&#xD;
      confirmed or suspected cases (72314) 14% of those affected required hospitalisation and 5%&#xD;
      required critical care. Thus far treatment has focused on quarantine and supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting outcomes in COVID disease requires risk stratifying infected patients. Data so far&#xD;
      have mainly come from small studies in China but the consistent risk factors appear to be&#xD;
      advanced age, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The CDC report a 10.5% risk&#xD;
      of death associated with underlying cardiovascular disease, surprisingly more than those with&#xD;
      respiratory disease, especially given that lung involvement is the dominant clinical&#xD;
      presentation. The reason for poor outcome in cardiovascular disease is unknown but is likely&#xD;
      to be multifactorial. A literature search of nine observational studies reported myocardial&#xD;
      injury based on high sensitivity troponin, abnormal ECG, abnormal echocardiogram or a&#xD;
      combination of the three. The reported rate of myocardial injury ranged from 7-28% and in all&#xD;
      groups was associated with higher rates of requirement for critical care. Mortality was&#xD;
      increased compared to those without myocardial injury- 51.2% vs 4.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to University Hospital Hairmyres (UHH) with confirmed COVID-19 will have 3&#xD;
      biomarkers - high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), N-terminal (NT)-proBNP and ferritin - added&#xD;
      on retrospectively to their admission blood samples, and an additional sample will be taken&#xD;
      for cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ECG and echocardiogram will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be observed during the remainder of the hospitalisation and for up to 30 days&#xD;
      from admission for major adverse cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of echocardiographic abnormalities in the cohort will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker levels will be compared between patients who require intensive treatment unit (ITU)&#xD;
      admission or not, ventilation or not or who die or survive up to 30 days using independent&#xD;
      samples t-tests if the data are normally distributed or Mann-Whitney-U tests if non normally&#xD;
      distributed.&#xD;

        We plan to enrol all consecutive admissions with COVID-19 disease admitted to UHH up until&#xD;
        a maximal target of 100 patients have been recruited. Patients will have a positive real&#xD;
        time reverse transcription (rt)PCR for SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab and/or chest X-ray or&#xD;
        CT imaging showing classical COVID-19 disease abnormalities ('classic/probable COVID-19,&#xD;
        mild/mod or severe' according to current British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidance, and&#xD;
        be within 5 days of admission (so as to enable us to retrospectively add on biomarkers to&#xD;
        blood samples sent on admission to hospital).&#xD;
