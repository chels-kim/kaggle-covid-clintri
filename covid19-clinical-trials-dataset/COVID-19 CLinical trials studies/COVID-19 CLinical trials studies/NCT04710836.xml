  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main overarching aim of this study is to build a research clinic, as part of the NoRCoRP&#xD;
      platform covering Nottingham and Nottinghamshire to facilitate learning and research in the&#xD;
      whole population of patients who have had COVID-19.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic, has&#xD;
      affected over 13 million people, and caused significant worldwide mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Frequent long-term respiratory complications include persistent breathlessness and fatigue,&#xD;
      with potential for ongoing organising pneumonia and new pulmonary fibrosis as well as&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease. Additional features seen in at least some patients post hospital&#xD;
      include impaired musculoskeletal function, impaired renal function, neurological impairment,&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction and significant psychiatric morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients with COVID-19 were not admitted to hospital, and the longer-term&#xD;
      consequences of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in this much larger patient group are unknown.&#xD;
      Whilst many patients had relatively mild disease and made a good recovery, a significant&#xD;
      number have been left with symptoms similar to those who were admitted to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In setting up a post COVID-19 review clinic, we expect to generate new findings, support&#xD;
      studies that have already been submitted for funding, to provide a focus for further grant&#xD;
      funding, and to provide an infrastructure to support new clinical trials. We also expect the&#xD;
      insights gained from research using this platform to be of value for service planning in the&#xD;
      region and beyond. We will prioritise patients who were not admitted to hospital but who have&#xD;
      been left with significant morbidity by establishing this new General Practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      referral research clinic.&#xD;
