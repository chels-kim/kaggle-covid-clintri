  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VXA-CoV2-1 is a non-replicating Ad5 vector adjuvanted oral tableted vaccine being developed&#xD;
      to prevent COVID-19, the disease resulting from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      VXA-CoV2-1 vaccine with repeat dosing at multiple dose levels. Safety and immunogenicity will&#xD;
      be evaluated for up to 12 months after the second dose of VXA-CoV2-1.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, dose-ranging trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      orally administered adenoviral-vector based vaccine (VXA-COV2-1) expressing a SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antigen and dsRNA adjuvant. Post screening activities, healthy adult volunteers aged 18 - 54&#xD;
      yrs old, inclusive, will be enrolled into the study. Participants will receive an oral dose&#xD;
      of vaccine at Days 1 and a subject will also receive a second dose at Day 29; total study&#xD;
      period will last ~ 2 months during the active phase, with a total 12 month safety follow-up&#xD;
      period post last vaccination. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at set times during the study active and follow-up periods. Subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the duration of the study follow-up period.&#xD;
