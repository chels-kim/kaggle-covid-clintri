  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world is currently facing a pandemic with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which leads to the&#xD;
      disease of COVID-19. Risk factors for a poor outcome of COVID-19 have so far been identified&#xD;
      as older age and co-morbidity including chronic respiratory conditions such as chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and current smoking status. Previous studies found, that&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among patients with these risk factors. There are&#xD;
      observational studies reporting independent associations between low serum concentrations of&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (the major circulating vitamin D metabolite) and susceptibility to acute&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D substitution in patients with COVID-19 who show a vitamin D deficiency should&#xD;
      therefore be investigated for efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study. The objective&#xD;
      of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients with vitamin D deficiency suffering from&#xD;
      COVID-19 treated under standardized conditions in hospital will recover faster when&#xD;
      additionally treated with a single high dose of vitamin D compared to standard treatment&#xD;
      only.&#xD;

      The world is currently experiencing a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The disease caused&#xD;
      by infection with this virus is known as COVID-19. Risk factors for a poor outcome of&#xD;
      COVID-19 have so far been found to include, older age and co-morbidity including chronic&#xD;
      respiratory conditions and current smoking status. Previous studies found, that vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency is more prevalent among patients with these risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are observational studies reporting independent associations between low serum&#xD;
      concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the major circulating vitamin D metabolite) and&#xD;
      susceptibility to acute respiratory tract infection. 25-hydroxyvitamin D supports induction&#xD;
      of antimicrobial peptides in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli suggesting a&#xD;
      potential mechanism by which vitamin D inducible protection against respiratory pathogens&#xD;
      might be mediated. The clear functions of vitamin D in the immune system are difficult to&#xD;
      define because the immune response is not a static process. The vitamin-D-receptor, which has&#xD;
      also been detected in immunological cells, suggests that vitamin D can regulate some&#xD;
      processes related to immunity. A further argument which supports a potential antiviral&#xD;
      activity of vitamin D is the modulation of the inflammatory response. The release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines by the influenza virus appeared to correlate with the severity of&#xD;
      illness. The use of vitamin D as a prophylactic for influenza has shown promise in prevention&#xD;
      of illness and reduction of secondary asthma in children. Inadequate vitamin D status is&#xD;
      associated with susceptibility to upper respiratory infections in patients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the ViDiCo-trial vitamin D supplementation protected&#xD;
      against moderate or severe exacerbation, but not upper respiratory infection, in patients&#xD;
      with COPD. A further study retrospectively examined data from 108 patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for whom a vitamin D status was available at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis revealed that over 95% of these patients had vitamin D deficiency. When examined&#xD;
      according to quarterly of serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D, a consistent inverse relationship&#xD;
      between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and length of hospital and ICU stay among survivors was&#xD;
      observed. Vitamin D substitution in patients with COVID-19 who show a vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      should therefore be investigated for efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose the investigators designed a randomized, placebo controlled double blind&#xD;
      trial to test the hypothesis hypothesis that a single high dose of vitamin D in addition to&#xD;
      standard treatment improves the recovery period positively in patients with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency compared to standard treatment only. That means, that the time of&#xD;
      recovery is shorter in the single high dose vitamin D group relative to standard treatment&#xD;
      group only.&#xD;
