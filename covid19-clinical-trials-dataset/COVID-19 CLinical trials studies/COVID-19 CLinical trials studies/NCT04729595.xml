  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2/3 Adaptive, Randomized, Double-blind, placebo-controlled enrolling high risk subjects&#xD;
      with early COVID19 infection with a primary endpoint of limiting hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the initial phase 2 portion of the study, 60 COVID positive subjects with&#xD;
      comorbidities will be enrolled. Eligible subjects positively diagnosed COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Tempol or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis by a DSMB will examine safety and markers of systemic inflammation during&#xD;
      a Stage 1 interim analysis. Based on the DSMB adjudication, the Phase 3 portion of the trial&#xD;
      will begin with a second interim analysis after enrollment of 150 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will seek to enroll approximately 310 subjects &gt; 18 years of age diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. All subjects will receive standard of care. As standard of care can vary&#xD;
      between institution over time for the treatment of COVID-19; Off label medication use,&#xD;
      therapies, devices, and interventions used in standard of care practice for COVID-19 is&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
