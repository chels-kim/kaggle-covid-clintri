      The study consists in a pragmatic superiority randomized controlled trial comparing different&#xD;
      strategies of psychotherapy for professionals and students from essential services with high&#xD;
      levels of emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      to be evaluated are Brief Cognitive Behavioral Telepsychotherapy, Brief Interpersonal&#xD;
      Telepsychotherapy and Telepsychoeducation, as an active control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: This study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Hospital de&#xD;
      Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre and is originally registered at Plataforma Brasil, a Brazilian study&#xD;
      registration platform (under CAAE: 30608420.5.0000.5327). Recruitment began in May 28th 2020.&#xD;

      PRAGMATIC TREATMENT TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      TITLE: &quot;A pragmatic superiority randomized controlled trial comparing Brief Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Telepsychotherapy, Brief Interpersonal Telepsychotherapy and Telepsychoeducation&#xD;
      for the reduction of emotional distress during COVID-19 outbreak in professionals and&#xD;
      students from essential services with a high level of emotional distress in Brazil&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 outbreak is associated with increased emotional distress (depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, and irritability) all over the world. Currently, there are no large randomized&#xD;
      trials testing interventions to reduce the burden caused by mental disorders during a&#xD;
      pandemic outbreak of these proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of two modalities of Brief-Telepsychotherapy (Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral and Interpersonal) to the reduction of symptoms of emotional distress (anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and irritability) in professionals and students from essential services with a&#xD;
      high level of those symptoms in Brazil during the COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thee-arm randomized clinical trial. Participants were&#xD;
      recruited in Brazil from the national service of telehealth provided by the ministry of&#xD;
      health. Participants included professional and students from essential services suffering&#xD;
      from high levels of anxiety, depression, and irritability symptoms during the COVID-19&#xD;
      outbreak. High levels of symptoms were defined by either of the following: (1) T score higher&#xD;
      than 70 on the PROMIS Anxiety Scale; (2) T score higher than 70 on the PROMIS Depression&#xD;
      Scale; (3) T score higher than 70 on the PROMIS Anger Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS: All participants will be randomized 1:1:1: to the Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Brief-Telepsychotherapy group (B-CBT, four sessions), Brief Interpersonal Telepsychotherapy&#xD;
      (B-IPT, four sessions) or Telepsychoeducation group (a single session psychoeducation group&#xD;
      plus weekly personalized pre-recorded videos for 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants with a&#xD;
      50% reduction in T-scores in all the scales that were scored above 70 at baseline at 1-month.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (1) the same measure of the primary outcome but measured at 3-month and&#xD;
      6-months follow-up; (2) mean score change in individual scales, quality of life and remission&#xD;
      levels (proportion of patients with T-score of 50 or below in all of the four emotional&#xD;
      distress subscales); (3) the same measure of the primary outcome but measured at midpoint&#xD;
      (after the second session or 2-weeks); and (4) service satisfaction and net-promoter score at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS: To detect a 15% group difference between each group, an alpha of 0.017 (3&#xD;
      comparisons, 0,05/3), power of 90%, and 20% loss to follow up, we would need a total of 333&#xD;
      participants per group.&#xD;
