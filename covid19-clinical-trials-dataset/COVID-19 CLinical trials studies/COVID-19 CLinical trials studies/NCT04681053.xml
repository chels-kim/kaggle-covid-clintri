  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-19 is global healthcare crisis. Till May 20, 2020, there were&#xD;
      approximately 4,789,205 cases and 318,789 related mortalities were identified globally. This&#xD;
      dramatic situation led to healthcare service collapse in many countries. Each country&#xD;
      developed its own action plan depending on healthcare expertise and the available resources.&#xD;
      There is no definitive therapy for Coronavirus disease-19 up till now. Many current and&#xD;
      investigational drugs are used nowadays. Recent reports suggest a beneficial role of&#xD;
      Ivermectin in the management of Coronavirus disease-19. A notice that necessitates further&#xD;
      clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the usage of inhaled ivermectin&#xD;
      in the management of Coronavirus disease-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease which is caused by the SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      virus. It is one of the biggest single-stranded RNA viruses. SARS-CoV2 Viral polyproteins are&#xD;
      responsible for viral replication and transcription while its protease enzymes are&#xD;
      responsible for polypeptides cleaving and immune system blockage. They are considered to be&#xD;
      an important therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Host immunological response against SARS-CoV2 could affect the disease outcome. Patients&#xD;
      requiring ICU admission have higher levels of interleukins 6 - 10, tumor necrosis factor α&#xD;
      (TNF-α), and fewer CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The level of cytokines and lymphopenia is&#xD;
      associated with pulmonary damage and respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till now, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19. Multiple current and investigational&#xD;
      drugs are used such as Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and Remdesivir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin: A potent anti-parasitic drug has shown to have an in-vitro antiviral activity&#xD;
      against a broad range of viruses. It inhibits the interaction between the human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) α/β1. But on&#xD;
      the other hand, Ivermectin showed limited efficacy against DENV in phase III clinical trial&#xD;
      that was done in Thailand in 2014-2017. Recent Studies proved the In-vitro effect and&#xD;
      &quot;subsequently&quot; the possible therapeutic role of Ivermectin in the management of SARS-CoV2.&#xD;
