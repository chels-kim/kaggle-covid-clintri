  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a significant strain on health care resources&#xD;
      across the world for managing critically ill patients. Emerging reports from China, South&#xD;
      Korea and Italy have reported varying incidence of acute kidney (AKI) ranging from 5-15% with&#xD;
      a mortality of 60-80% however there is no systematic assessment of the risk factors,&#xD;
      recognition, course and outcomes in patients with and without kidney disease whose course is&#xD;
      complicated by AKI1-4. Patients with underlying CKD, immunosuppressed patients with renal&#xD;
      transplants and ESKD patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and there is limited&#xD;
      information on the effect of COVID-19 on the course and outcomes of these patients. The&#xD;
      requirement for renal support including IHD, CRRT and sorbent based therapies has been&#xD;
      variable and has contributed to the intense pressure on the nephrology and critical care&#xD;
      providers for delivering these therapies. As the COVID-19 pandemic expands in the USA and&#xD;
      abroad, there is an intense need to understand the epidemiology of the disease and the&#xD;
      resources needed for renal support to inform clinical management and public health&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to investigate health care facilities across the world&#xD;
      (hospital wards, ICU, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, healthcare centers) to draw a global&#xD;
      picture of incidence, risk factors, resources available for treatment and prognosis of acute&#xD;
      and chronic kidney disease in patient with COVID 19 confirmed infection. The aim is to&#xD;
      identify trends in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease, determine its incidence,&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes in different settings across the world. This information will be used&#xD;
      to develop and implement educational tools and resources to prevent deaths from AKI and&#xD;
      progression of CKD in this and following pandemics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute and Chronic kidney diseases are important causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide.&#xD;
      The associated socioeconomic burden of kidney disease and AKI, as in some cases recovery is&#xD;
      incomplete and chronic kidney disease (CKD) can arise, is a growing problem around the world.&#xD;
      During the COVID 19 pandemic the incidence of AKI has been reported to be as low as 0.5% to&#xD;
      as high as 23%. AKI was reported to develop at a median of 15 days in one study, and another&#xD;
      study reported that most AKI developed within 7 days of admission. The data on acute kidney&#xD;
      injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 is mostly from patients who are hospitalized, and in&#xD;
      some studies limited to critically ill patients in the ICU. In ICU patients the requirement&#xD;
      for renal support and mortality is reported to be high, however is a lack of epidemiological&#xD;
      studies specifically designed to determine the impact of COVID 19 on kidney outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality rate of patients with kidney dysfunction varies widely and is inversely related&#xD;
      to country income and percentage of gross domestic product spent on total health expenditure.&#xD;
      Several initiatives will be very insightful and identified important gaps in knowledge, more&#xD;
      effort is required to understand this problem affecting all regions of the globe. In order to&#xD;
      eventually implement resources and tools to help prevent, diagnose and treat patients with&#xD;
      COVID 19 infection and kidney dysfunction, the investigators need to understand its&#xD;
      incidence, risk factors, available resources and barriers to diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will collect data on kidney function progression in patients infected with COVID&#xD;
      19 across the world. The study will open to individual physicians across the world who agreed&#xD;
      to participate by providing de-identified clinical and lab data of patients with confirmed&#xD;
      COVID 19 infection with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Establish incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in different settings&#xD;
      worldwide during the COVID 19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare risk factors, etiologies, diagnosis, management and outcomes of acute and&#xD;
           chronic kidney dysfunction in COVID 19 patients in different countries&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine resources available for recognition, non-dialytic and dialytic management and&#xD;
           follow up of patients with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection&#xD;
           in different settings and countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine long term outcomes, 6 months and 1 year, of patients with acute and chronic&#xD;
           kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection in different settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate barriers preventing access to the standard treatments of acute and chronic&#xD;
           kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection across different countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the impact of COVID 19 infection on the progression of acute and chronic&#xD;
           kidney disease in patient with native and transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate the treatment strategies of patient with ESKD on hospitalized patients with&#xD;
           COVID 19.&#xD;
