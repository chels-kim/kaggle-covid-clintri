  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SUMMIT (Scaling Up Maternal Mental health care by Increasing access to Treatment) overarching&#xD;
      goal is to examine the scalability and patient-centered provision of brief, evidence-based&#xD;
      psychological treatments for perinatal depression and anxiety (N=1368). Specifically, and&#xD;
      through a multi-site, randomized, pragmatic trial, the trial examines whether one brief,&#xD;
      behavioral activation (BA) delivered via telemedicine is as effective as the same treatment&#xD;
      delivered in person; and whether BA delivered by non-mental health nurses, with appropriate&#xD;
      training is as effective as when delivered by specialist providers (psychiatrists,&#xD;
      psychologists and social workers) in reducing perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in Toronto, Chicago and North Carolina. The trial will also identify&#xD;
      relevant underlying implementation processes and determine whether, and to what extent, these&#xD;
      strategies work differentially for certain women over others.&#xD;

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the same BA treatment for perinatal&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptoms in one of four arms: 1) In-person specialist; 2) Telemedicine&#xD;
      specialist; 3) In-person non-specialist; 4) Telemedicine non-specialist. For the duration of&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic period, participants were only randomized to 1) Telemedicine&#xD;
      non-specialist; 2) Telemedicine specialist.&#xD;

    <measure>Treatment of perinatal depressive symptoms by non-specialist providers</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Brief BA psychological treatment is delivered by non-specialist providers. The perinatal depressive symptoms are measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. The minimum and maximum values for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale are 0 and 30 respectively. Higher scale scores are associated with higher perinatal depressive symptoms. The assessment period is extended to account for post-treatment outcomes when there are interruptions to treatment (e.g., giving birth, obstetrical complications and COVID-19 related events).</description>

    <time_frame>3-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Brief BA psychological treatment is delivered by non-specialist providers. The anxiety symptoms are measured by the Generalized Anxiety 7 Item Questionnaire. The minimum and maximum values for the Generalized Anxiety 7 Item Questionnaire are 0 and 21 respectively. Higher scale scores are associated with higher perinatal anxiety symptoms. The assessment period is extended to account for post-treatment outcomes when there are interruptions to treatment (e.g., giving birth, obstetrical complications and COVID-19 related events).</description>

The minimum and maximum values for the Generalized Anxiety 7 Item Questionnaire are 0 and 21 respectively. Higher scale scores are associated with higher perinatal anxiety symptoms.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Mental Health Development</measure>
    <time_frame>9 to 15 months post child birth</time_frame>
    <description>Child mental development is measured by Bayley Mental Developmental Scale III and the provision of psychosocial stimulation by the mother measured by Home Observation Measurement Evaluation. Cognitive development, expressive and receptive language, and fine and gross motor development composite scores are measured by Bayley Mental Developmental Scale III. The composite scores are scaled to a metric, with a mean of 100, standard deviation of 15, and range of 40 to 160. Higher scaled scores are associated with higher mental health development in child. The minimum and maximum values for the Home Observation Measurement Evaluation scale scores are 0 and 45 respectively. Higher scores are associated with more enriched environment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response and Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Response and Remission is measured by Patient Health Questionnaire 9. The minimum and maximum values for Patient Health Questionnaire 9 are 0 and 27 respectively. Response and Remission is defined as PHQ-9 of less than 10 and 5 respectively. The assessment period is extended to account for post-treatment outcomes when there are interruptions to treatment (e.g., giving birth, obstetrical complications and COVID-19 related events).</description>
