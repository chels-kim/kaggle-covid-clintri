  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, multicenter study provides the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and&#xD;
      trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) administered at home by a home health&#xD;
      nursing provider for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+)&#xD;
      breast cancer who are currently receiving pertuzumab (Perjeta) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) by&#xD;
      intravenous administration (P+H IV). The main objective is to enable continuity of care&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 400 participants with HER2+ breast cancer who have&#xD;
      completed concurrent chemotherapy with P+H IV and are currently receiving or will be&#xD;
      receiving maintenance therapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive treatment every 3 weeks and continue treatment unless early&#xD;
      cessation is necessary due to disease recurrence, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      or participant withdrawal. Only participants with HER2+ early breast cancer will receive PH&#xD;
      FDC SC to complete 18 cycles of dual blockade, including the P+H IV they received prior to&#xD;
      enrolling in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor may decide to terminate the study when the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a risk&#xD;
      for this patient population.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Fixed-Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab for Subcutaneous Administration (PH FDC SC)</intervention_name>
    <description>PH FDC SC is given as a fixed dose (i.e. non-weight based) subcutaneous injection. Two dosage configurations of PH FDC SC may be administered in the study: a 15-millilitre (mL) loading dose consisting of 1200 milligrams (mg) pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab and a 10-mL maintenance dose consisting of 600 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab. Participants who have had ≥6 weeks since their last P+H IV or PH FDC SC treatment must receive a loading dose before continuing with maintenance doses for subsequent administrations.</description>
