      Abstract The objective of this study is to review, through prospective case research, the&#xD;
      efficacy of oral chlorine dioxide in the treatment of patients with COVID infection 19. The&#xD;
      research will be carried out between April and June 2020 with a quasi-experimental design in&#xD;
      two health care centers on a sample of twenty (20) patients, through direct intervention, who&#xD;
      will measure the changes in the manifest symptoms of infection and negativity. a COVID 19&#xD;
      after administration of the study preparation, to determine the effectiveness of chlorine&#xD;
      dioxide in the treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results that are found and on the evaluation of efficacy on the basis of&#xD;
      clinical improvement on a scale of 1 to 5, and of the negativization of COVID 19, we can&#xD;
      conclude whether the therapeutic efficacy in this investigation is considered good by&#xD;
      verifying whether or not there is efficacy of treatment with chlorine dioxide in COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this research, it is hoped to stimulate the search for new therapeutic options in the&#xD;
      treatment of COVID 19 and contribute to the development of NEW options in medications,&#xD;
      considering the immense number of deaths and morbidity that currently exists in the present&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

      Introduction The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is responding to an&#xD;
      outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus that was first detected in China&#xD;
      and has now been detected in almost 90 locations worldwide, including in the United States.&#xD;
      The virus has been termed &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; and the disease causing it has been termed&#xD;
      &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (abbreviated &quot;COVID-19&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current covid19 pandemic is a situation that: is severe, unusual, or unexpected; it has&#xD;
      implications for public health beyond the national border of the affected State; and requires&#xD;
      immediate international action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the same reason, it is urgent to look for routes that can contribute something new,&#xD;
      hopefully fast, effective and economic that will solve or mitigate the current pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work we will use the bases of translational medicine to bring conventional medicine,&#xD;
      studies and treatment that are born from the terrain of diverse therapeutic possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBLEM STATEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the problem Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
      It was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) in December 2019. In&#xD;
      three months it spread to practically every country in the world, which is why the World&#xD;
      Health Organization declared it a pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no known effective treatment for the disease. The WHO recommends that randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials be conducted with volunteers to test the effectiveness and safety of some&#xD;
      potential treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, we look at research processes given in the past to carry out (initial&#xD;
      translational medicine) those promising and initial observations in infectious treatment to&#xD;
      covid treatment 19 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delimitation of the Problem it was considered that the research that could really contribute&#xD;
      to addressing the problem previously raised, should be directed to the development of a drug&#xD;
      proposal of therapeutic possibilities studied in the past, based on both conventional and&#xD;
      unconventional research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General and specific research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      General purpose :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of oral chlorine dioxide in the treatment of COVID 19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure the positivity or negativity of COVID 19 in patients who received treatment with&#xD;
           chlorine dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the clinical improvement based on the VAS visual scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results :&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is expected is to reduce morbidity and especially mortality from viral infection of&#xD;
      COVID, through management with chlorine dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, starting from the delimitation of the problem, the following research question&#xD;
      is posed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Could the use of chlorine dioxide modify morbidity and mortality in patients infected with&#xD;
      COVID 19?&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION Given the avalanche of deaths caused by the coronavirus in the absence of truly&#xD;
      effective treatment, we have developed a protocol for dealing with COVID infection,&#xD;
      particularly in hospitalized patients and in the ICU, with the aim of trying to reduce the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of the Viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      , we recommend a complementary experimental and exploratory approach that seeks to reduce the&#xD;
      destructive and fibrotic effects of the process , as well as the storm. leukocyte and&#xD;
      antiphospholipid syndrome that occurs in many cases and in other cases prevent, while&#xD;
      reducing, the recovery times of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of the art at the international level in research treatments against coronavirus â€¢&#xD;
      Vaccines Three vaccination strategies are being investigated. First, the researchers aim to&#xD;
      build a complete virus vaccine. T. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a&#xD;
      vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain virus subunits. . A third strategy is&#xD;
      nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccine).&#xD;
      Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and&#xD;
      efficacy. It is likely to take months to a year to achieve a truly efficient vaccine. The&#xD;
      mutagenicity of the virus makes it difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antivirals On January 23, Gilead Sciences was in communication with researchers and&#xD;
      physicians in the United States and China about the ongoing outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus&#xD;
      and the potential use of Remdesivir as an investigational treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In late January, the Russian Ministry of Health identified three adult medications that could&#xD;
      help treat the disease. They are ribavirin, lopinavir / ritonavir, and interferon beta-1b.&#xD;
      These drugs are commonly used to treat hepatitis C, HIV infection, and multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
      respectively. The ministry provided Russian hospitals with descriptions and guides on the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of the treatment and the recommended doses. In February, China started&#xD;
      using triazavirin, a 2014 drug developed in Russia, with the aim of testing whether it is&#xD;
      effective in controlling the disease. This drug was created at the Ural Federal University in&#xD;
      Yekaterinburg to treat H5N1 flu (avian flu). It has been used against COVID-19 due to the&#xD;
      similarity between the two diseases. On March 18 an article reports that lopinavir /&#xD;
      ritonavir treatment is negative in clinical trials with 199 patients in China. There are no&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese researchers discovered that Arbidol, an antiviral drug used to Treating the flu could&#xD;
      be combined with Darunavir, a medicine used in the treatment of HIV, to treat patients with&#xD;
      coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 associated&#xD;
      pneumonia. In clinical trials with 100 patients, it was found to be superior to control&#xD;
      treatment to inhibit exacerbation of pneumonia, improve lung imaging findings, promote&#xD;
      negative virus conversion, and shorten disease. chloroquine could prevent orf1ab, ORF3a, and&#xD;
      ORF10 from attacking heme to form porphyrin, and inhibit the binding of ORF8 and surface&#xD;
      glycoproteins to porphyrins to some extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Center for Biotechnology Development of China stated on March 17 that the&#xD;
      antiviral Favipiravir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, showed positive results in a case-control&#xD;
      study of 80 patients at Shenzhen People's Hospital No. 3, The who received Favipiravir&#xD;
      treatment tested negative within a shorter period of time compared to the control group, and&#xD;
      recommends that it be included in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, would be more potent in&#xD;
      inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. On March 16, 2020, a leading French authority and&#xD;
      French Government advisor on COVID-19, Professor Didier Raoult of the Instituto University&#xD;
      Hospital Institute of Infectious Diseases (IHU-MÃ©diterranÃ©e infection) in Marseille&#xD;
      (Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne, Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d 'Azur), announced that a trial with 24 patients from&#xD;
      southeastern France had shown that chloroquine is a treatment effective for COVID-19. 600 mg&#xD;
      of hydroxychloroquine (brand name Plaquenil) were administered to these patients every day&#xD;
      for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Against the cytokine storm Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by&#xD;
           the China National Health Commission after a small study was completed. In combination&#xD;
           with an analysis of Serum ferritin blood to identify cytokine storms is intended to&#xD;
           counteract such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some&#xD;
           affected individuals. The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for&#xD;
           treatment of cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy,&#xD;
           in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive antibody therapy The use of blood donations from healthy people who have already&#xD;
           recovered from COVID-19 is being investigated, a strategy that has also been tested for&#xD;
           SARS, a previous cousin of COVID-19. The mechanism of action is that antibodies&#xD;
           naturally produced in the immune system of those who have already recovered are&#xD;
           transferred to people who need them through a non-vaccine-based form of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vir Biotechnology, based in San Francisco, is evaluating the effectiveness of previously&#xD;
      identified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers from Utrecht University and Erasmus MC announced that they found a human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic search of the use of chlorine dioxide in the international bibliography for&#xD;
      indexed literature was made .The most significant findings in the bibliography referenced&#xD;
      above is that they are focused on disinfection of areas, use in oral health, use in agronomy&#xD;
      and a phase 1 study in rats with Influenza A-induced infection in two groups, one treated&#xD;
      with chlorine dioxide and the other without chlorine dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK CHLORINE DIOXIDE AND THE BASES OF ITS THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic action of chlorine dioxide is given by its selectivity for pH. It means that&#xD;
      this molecule dissociates and releases oxygen when it comes in contact with another acid.&#xD;
      When reacting, it is converted to sodium chloride (common salt) and at the same time it&#xD;
      releases oxygen, which in turn oxidizes (combusts) the pathogens (harmful germs) of acidic&#xD;
      pH, converting them into alkaline oxides (&quot;ashes&quot;). Therefore, as chlorine dioxide&#xD;
      dissociates, it releases oxygen in the blood, as do erythrocytes (red blood cells) through&#xD;
      the same principle (known as the Bohr effect), which is to be selective for acidity. Like&#xD;
      blood, chlorine dioxide releases oxygen when it encounters acidity, either from lactic acid&#xD;
      or from the acidity of the pathogen. Its therapeutic effect is due, among others, to the fact&#xD;
      that it helps in the recovery of many types of diseases, creating an alkaline environment, at&#xD;
      the same time eliminating small acid pathogens, in my opinion, through oxidation, with an&#xD;
      impossible electromagnetic overload to dissipate by unicellular organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicellular tissue has the ability to dissipate this charge and is not affected in the same&#xD;
      way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemistry, in turn, defines cell protection through hydrogen sulfide groups. Chlorine&#xD;
      dioxide, which is the second strongest disinfectant known after ozone, is much more indicated&#xD;
      for therapeutic use since it is also capable of penetrating and eliminating biofilm,&#xD;
      something that ozone does not do. The great advantage of the therapeutic use of Chlorine&#xD;
      dioxide is the impossibility of bacterial resistance to ClO2. Chlorine dioxide is a selective&#xD;
      oxidant and unlike other substances it does not react with most components of living tissue.&#xD;
      Chlorine dioxide does react quickly with phenols and thyroles essential for bacterial life.&#xD;
      In phenols, the mechanism is to attack the benzene ring, eliminating odor, taste and other&#xD;
      intermediate compounds. Chlorine dioxide removes viruses effectively and is up to 10 times&#xD;
      more effective Evaluation of the antiviral activity of chlorine dioxide against feline&#xD;
      calicivirus, human influenza virus, measlesvirus, canine distemper virus, human herpesvirus,&#xD;
      human adenovirus, canine adenovirus and canine parvovirus. It also proved to be highly&#xD;
      effective against small parasites, the protozoa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject of great concern to medical professionals in medical scientific terms is the&#xD;
      reactivity of chlorine dioxide with essential amino acids. In some tests on the reactivity of&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide with 21 essential amino acids, only cysteine , Tryptophan and tyrosine ,&#xD;
      proline and hydroxyproline were reactive at a pH around 6. . These amino acids are relatively&#xD;
      easy to replace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cysteine and Methionine . Oxidation by chlorine dioxide of methionine and cysteine&#xD;
      derivatives to sulfoxide they are two aromatic amino acids that contain sulfide, tryptophan&#xD;
      and tyrosine and the 2 inorganic ions FE2 + and Mn2 +. Cysteine, due to its membership in the&#xD;
      thiol group, is an amino acid up to 50 times more reactive with all microbe systems than the&#xD;
      other four essential amino acids, and therefore unable to create resistance against chlorine&#xD;
      dioxide. Although it is not scientifically proven to date, pharmacodynamics usually assumes&#xD;
      that the cause of its antimicrobial effect is due to its reactions to the four amino acids&#xD;
      listed above or to protein and peptide residues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chlorine dioxide is a yellow gas that dissolves easily in water, without altering its&#xD;
           structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is obtained by mixing sodium chlorite and dilute hydrochloric acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The chlorine dioxide gas dissolved in water is an oxidant 3. Chlorine dioxide is pH&#xD;
      selective and the more acidic the pathogen, the stronger the reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. According to toxicological studies by the EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency),&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide does not leave residues, nor does it accumulate in the body in the long&#xD;
      term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. In the oxidation process it is converted to oxygen and sodium chloride (common salt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHLORINE DIOXIDE AND THE BASES OF ITS THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION IN CORONAVIRUSES Chlorine&#xD;
      dioxide (ClO 2) has been used for over 100 years to fight all kinds of bacteria, viruses, and&#xD;
      fungi. It acts as a disinfectant, since in its mode of action it turns out to be an oxidant.&#xD;
      It closely resembles the way our own body works, for example in phagocytosis, where an&#xD;
      oxidation process is used to eliminate all kinds of pathogens. Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) is a&#xD;
      yellowish gas that, to date, has not been introduced into the conventional pharmacopoeia as&#xD;
      an active ingredient, although it is compulsory used to disinfect and preserve blood bags for&#xD;
      transfusions. It is also used in the majority of bottled waters suitable for consumption,&#xD;
      since it leaves no toxic residues; in addition to being a very soluble gas in water and that&#xD;
      evaporates from 11 ÂºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent pandemic of the Covid-19 coronavirus demands urgent solutions with an approach&#xD;
      with all possible approaches, whether conventional or alternative. In previous&#xD;
      investigations, chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) in aqueous solution at low doses eliminated this&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach is as follows: on the one hand we know that viruses are absolutely sensitive to&#xD;
      oxidation and therefore, it is used in human blood bags against viruses such as HIV and&#xD;
      studies in rats reveal that it completely controls virus infections Influenza A, it is&#xD;
      proposed that it should also act on SARS -Cov -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Base proposals for mechanisms of action in COVID 19&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chlorine dioxide removes viruses through the selective oxidation process in a very short&#xD;
           time. It does this by denaturing the capsid proteins, and subsequently oxidizes the&#xD;
           genetic material of the virus, disabling it. A completely new approach that has been&#xD;
           studied by Andreas Ludwig Kalcker, one of the members of this research team, for more&#xD;
           than thirteen years with the result of three pharmaceutical patents for parenteral use.&#xD;
           It can be produced by any pharmacy as a master preparation and has been used in a&#xD;
           similar way to (DAC N-055) in the old German Drug Code as &quot;Natrium Chlorosum&quot; since&#xD;
           1990.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Until now solutions have been proposed that result in extremely slow processes, and&#xD;
           given the rate of attack of the virus, we must try to use the fastest and most&#xD;
           expeditious routes possible. The great advantage of chlorine dioxide is that it works&#xD;
           for any viral subspecies and there are no possible resistances to this type of&#xD;
           oxidation. Let's not forget that this substance has been used for 100 years in&#xD;
           wastewater without generating any type of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is already scientific evidence that chlorine dioxide is effective in SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           coronaviruses, It has also been shown to be effective in human coronavirus and in&#xD;
           animals such as dogs, known as canine respiratory coronavirus, or in cats, including&#xD;
           feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the better known virus of feline infectious&#xD;
           peritonitis (FIPV), since it denatures the capsids by oxidation inactivating the virus&#xD;
           in a short time .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that chlorine dioxide to ingest is a completely new antiviral approach as&#xD;
      it is an oxidant and can eliminate by combustion any subspecies or mutant variant of virus.&#xD;
      Given the emergency situation in which we currently find ourselves with Covid-19, the oral&#xD;
      use of ClO2 is proposed immediately through a protocol already known and used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Toxicity: The biggest problems that arise with medications in general are due to their&#xD;
      toxicity and side effects. New studies demonstrate its viability. Although the toxicity of&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide in case of massive inhalation is known, there is no clinically proven death&#xD;
      even at high doses by oral ingestion. The lethal dose (LD50, acute toxicity ratio) is&#xD;
      considered to be 292 mg per kilogram for 14 days, where its equivalent in a 50 kg adult would&#xD;
      be 15,000 mg administered for two weeks of a gas dissolved in water (something almost&#xD;
      impossible). The oral sub-toxic doses used are around 50 mg dissolved in 100 ml of water 10&#xD;
      times a day, which is equivalent to 0.5 g daily (and, therefore, only 1/30 of the LD50 of 15&#xD;
      g of ClO2 per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorine dioxide dissociates, breaks down in the human body in a few hours into a negligible&#xD;
      amount of common salt (NaCL) and oxygen (O2) within the human body. Furthermore, measurements&#xD;
      of venous blood gases have indicated that it is capable of substantially improving the lung&#xD;
      oxygenation capacity of the affected patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATION CHLORINE DIOXIDE AGAINST VIRUSES As a general rule, most viruses behave similarly&#xD;
      and once they bind to the appropriate host type - bacteria or cell, as the case may be - the&#xD;
      nucleic acid component that the virus introduces takes over after protein synthesis processes&#xD;
      in the infected cell. Certain segments of the viral nucleic acid are responsible for the&#xD;
      replication of the genetic material of the capsid. In the presence of these nucleic acids,&#xD;
      the CLO2 molecule becomes unstable and dissociates, releasing the resulting oxygen to the&#xD;
      medium, which in turn helps to oxygenate the surrounding tissue, increasing the mitochondrial&#xD;
      activity and, therefore, the response of the immune system. Nucleic acids, DNA-RNA, consist&#xD;
      of a chain of puric and pyrimidine bases, see: guanine (G), cytosine (C), adenine (A) and&#xD;
      thymine (T). It is the sequence of these four units along the chain that makes one segment&#xD;
      different from another. The guanine base, which is found in both RNA and DNA, is very&#xD;
      sensitive to oxidation, forming 8-oxoguanin as a by-product of it. Therefore, when the CLO2&#xD;
      molecule comes in contact with guanine and oxidizes it, it leads to the formation of&#xD;
      8-oxoguanin, thus blocking viral nucleic acid replication by base pairing. Although the&#xD;
      replication of the protein capsid may continue; Fully functional virus formation is blocked&#xD;
      by oxidation thanks to CLO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLO2 molecule has characteristics that make it an ideal candidate for treatment in the&#xD;
      clinical setting, since it is a product with a high selective oxidation power and a great&#xD;
      capacity to reduce acidosis, increasing oxygen in the tissues and mitochondria, thus&#xD;
      facilitating the rapid recovery of patients with lung diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Chlorine dioxide reacts with antioxidants and&#xD;
      various acids, so the use of vitamin C or ascorbic acid is not recommended during treatment,&#xD;
      as it nullifies the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide in the elimination of pathogens (the&#xD;
      antioxidant effect of one prevents the selective oxidation of the other.) Therefore, it is&#xD;
      not advisable to take antioxidants during the days of treatment. Stomach acid has been shown&#xD;
      not to affect its effectiveness. In patients with Warfarin treatment, they should constantly&#xD;
      check the values to avoid cases of overdose, as chlorine dioxide has been shown to improve&#xD;
      blood flow. Although chlorine dioxide is very soluble in water, it has the advantage that it&#xD;
      does not hydrolyze, so it does not generate toxic carcinogenic THM (trihalomethanes) such as&#xD;
      chlorine. It also does not cause genetic mutations or malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Orally administered chlorine dioxide eliminates COVID infection 19. METHODOLOGY&#xD;
      TYPE OF STUDY Observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study of a group of cases.&#xD;
      Characteristics of our study: Like quasi-experimental studies, it is used, particularly, to&#xD;
      determine the effect of treatments or interventions. It has two basic characteristics: the&#xD;
      first, it does not require the randomization procedure for the formation of the study and&#xD;
      control groups; the second may or may not have control groups. This quasi-experimental study&#xD;
      offers an adequate level of internal and external validity. In addition, we will use time&#xD;
      series without a control group, based on a single group that serves as study and control.&#xD;
      Once established, periodic measurements of the dependent variable are carried out, then the&#xD;
      treatment is applied and subsequently the dependent variable continues to be measured&#xD;
      periodically.&#xD;

        The population to which the study was directed consisted of a group of patients of medical&#xD;
        and health profession with active infection with COVID-19, from various medical care&#xD;
        centers, hospitals, in the city of BogotÃ¡, Colombia and Madrid, Spain (multicenter .) The&#xD;
        selection of the patients was made based on the self-proposal of the doctors / patients as&#xD;
        candidates for research, which refers to the fact that they proposed themselves as cases.&#xD;
        Similarly, simultaneity was applied, which means that the patients were obtained in the&#xD;
        same period of time in which the cases arose.&#xD;
