  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of a saliva based home&#xD;
      surveillance monitoring test for SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to carry out as many tests as are included in the bag they are&#xD;
      provided, on a daily basis until they are used up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Tests Provided to Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Five tests to each hospitalized patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two tests to each high risk or positive patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Three tests to each participant from the low risk population&#xD;
