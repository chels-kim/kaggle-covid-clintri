  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is defined as an acute change in mental status characterized by fluctuating&#xD;
      disturbances of consciousness, attention, cognition, and perception, usually secondary to&#xD;
      acute injuries such as trauma or infections. Delirium is more frequent in older adults, and&#xD;
      is associated with important poor clinical outcomes including increased mortality, functional&#xD;
      deterioration, and higher expenditures for healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is not the only one responsible, the inflammatory response plays a key role in&#xD;
      the development of delirium. From the first descriptions of the condition 2500 years ago, it&#xD;
      is known that patients who present with inflammatory injuries such as trauma (pe. hip&#xD;
      fracture) or infections (sepsis), frequently develop delirium. Microglia, are an inflammatory&#xD;
      cell with phagocytic capacity, that inhabit the nervous system and have a critical role in&#xD;
      the regulation of the inflammatory response in the brain. It is known that microglia have&#xD;
      receptors that respond to systemic inflammatory mediators by generating new inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators that exert their effect on other glial cells and neurons in the central nervous&#xD;
      system, affecting their function. Mouse models have shown that depleting the brain of&#xD;
      microglia prevents cognitive decline after a traumatic bone injury, suggesting a role of&#xD;
      these cells in the development of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme that participates in DNA repair,&#xD;
      and in the regulation of the expression of inflammatory mediators by immune cell. In vitro&#xD;
      experiments have shown that PARP-1 enhances the microglial response to inflammation, and data&#xD;
      from mice exposed to the bacterial component &quot;lipo-poly-saccharide (LPS)&quot;, a classical model&#xD;
      of delirium, showed that pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 prevents cognitive decline&#xD;
      secondary to that injury. Interestingly, nicotinamide, a vitamin widely available in the&#xD;
      market, with a well-known safety profile in humans, is a well-recognized inhibitor of PARP-1.&#xD;
      The role of PARP-1 nor nicotinamide in delirium has never been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that, 1) there is evidence showing that PARP-1 may act as an enhancer of the&#xD;
      inflammatory response of microglia and 2) the protective effect against cognitive impairment&#xD;
      produced by pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 in a mice model of delirium, we propose as&#xD;
      hypothesis that PARP-1 participates in delirium pathogenesis by enhancing microglial&#xD;
      activation in response to systemic inflammation. To address this hypothesis in patients, we&#xD;
      propose to determine in a randomized clinical trial whether nicotinamide, a pharmacological&#xD;
      inhibitor of PARP-1, is more effective than placebo for the prevention of delirium in older&#xD;
      adults with requirement of oxygen (non-invasive) and suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&#xD;
      under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this research will contribute significantly in the field of delirium,&#xD;
      improving the knowledge of its physiopathology, as well with the development of of new&#xD;
      alternatives for its prevention in clinical practice.&#xD;
