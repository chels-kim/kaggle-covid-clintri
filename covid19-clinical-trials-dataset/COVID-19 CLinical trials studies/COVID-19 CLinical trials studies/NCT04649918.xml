  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is assumed that the number of patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19-related disabilities will increase significantly. Patients with mild, severe,&#xD;
      and critical forms of the disease show long-term sequelae in different systems (respiratory,&#xD;
      muscular, psychological, cognitive etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent dyspnea is a frequently described symptom after the acute phase of the disease.&#xD;
      Coupled with reduced oxygen saturation, an increased risk of developing lung fibrosis has&#xD;
      been observed. Specialized rehabilitation medicine (e.g. pulmonary rehabilitation) might&#xD;
      counteract these long-term consequences and therefore seems to be a promising approach to&#xD;
      treat long-term COVID-19 consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, there is scarce evidence about COVID-19 specific rehabilitation contents. It was&#xD;
      suggested to use treatment regimes in analogy to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation improves physical performance, quality of&#xD;
      life and reduces anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and other chronic respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since impairments related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also play an important role in&#xD;
      COVID-19, the aim of this study is to evaluate the short and medium-term effects of a&#xD;
      standardized 3-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. The results will be analyzed within the&#xD;
      two cohorts (mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID 19) as well as between the two cohorts&#xD;
      for the primary outcome. Furthermore, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation will be&#xD;
      compared with a retrospective cohort of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
