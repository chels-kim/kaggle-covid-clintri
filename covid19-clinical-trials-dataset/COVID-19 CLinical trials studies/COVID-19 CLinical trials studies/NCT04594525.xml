      A list of potential participants, including contact information, will be extracted from Women&#xD;
      Wellness and Research Center's registry. A probability sampling technique (simple random&#xD;
      selection) will be employed to randomly select (Automated Random Number Generator) the&#xD;
      potential participants. Then, the potential participants will be contacted and informed about&#xD;
      the study. After consenting to participate, they will be screened for eligibility. The&#xD;
      pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria will be enrolled and followed up until nine&#xD;
      months after delivery. The contact details of each participant will be written on a paper and&#xD;
      sealed in an envelope marked with either letter A or B. Upon enrolment, the participants will&#xD;
      be randomized equally with a block size of two into two parallel arms. The pregnant women in&#xD;
      the interventional arm will receive six sessions of a low-intensity psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      through telemental health consultations with a trained psychologist. On the other hand, those&#xD;
      in the control arm will not receive any intervention. The participants in both arms will be&#xD;
      screened for psychological distress (six times) over the study period.&#xD;
