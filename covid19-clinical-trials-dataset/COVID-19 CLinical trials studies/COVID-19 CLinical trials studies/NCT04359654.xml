  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomised, Best-Available-Care (BAC) and historic-controlled trial of&#xD;
      nebulised dornase alfa [2.5 mg BID] for 7 days in participants with COVID-19 who are admitted&#xD;
      to hospital and are at risk of ventilatory failure (the COVASE study). Controls will include&#xD;
      a randomised arm to receive BAC, historic data from UCLH patients with COVID-19 and biobanked&#xD;
      samples will be used to demonstrate an effect of dornase alfa. CRP will be measured to assess&#xD;
      the effect of dornase alfa on inflammation. Clinical endpoints and biomarkers (e.g. d-dimer)&#xD;
      will be used to assess the clinical response. Exploratory endpoints will explore the effects&#xD;
      of dornase alfa on features of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dornase alfa is a recombinant human DNase enzyme indicated in conjunction with standard&#xD;
      therapies for the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) to improve pulmonary function. Dornase&#xD;
      alfa degrades extracellular DNA, and so promotes the clearance of NETs and lead to a&#xD;
      significant improvement in lung function for treated CF patients by facilitating mucus&#xD;
      clearance in the lung. Dornase alfa is approved worldwide as a nebulised formulation, with an&#xD;
      excellent safety profile and is well tolerated. The most common side effect is a hoarse&#xD;
      voice. Moreover, dornase alfa could be administered in addition to effective antiviral&#xD;
      therapy and should not interfere with antiviral drugs that could be used for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By facilitating the clearance of NETs, dornase alfa not only facilitates sputum clearance in&#xD;
      CF patients, but has additional anti-inflammatory activity. Dornase alfa has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce NETs in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum of participants with CF (Konstan&#xD;
      et al 2012). In the Bronchoalveolar Lavage for the Evaluation of Anti-inflammatory Treatment&#xD;
      (BEAT) study, the percentage of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid significantly&#xD;
      increased in untreated CF patients (P&lt;0.02) while remaining constant in the dornase&#xD;
      alfa-treated group. Levels of elastase and IL-8 also significantly increased from baseline in&#xD;
      the untreated group (P&lt;0.007 and P&lt;0.02 for elastase and IL-8, respectively), but remained&#xD;
      stable in patients receiving dornase alfa (Konstan and Ratjen, J. Cyst. Fibros. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is scientific evidence to support the potential benefits of dornase alfa in COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Viral sepsis driven by a hyperinflammation is thought to be a major cause of&#xD;
      mortality in COVID-19 infection. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and TNFα are key cytokines in&#xD;
      microbial sepsis. Positive outcomes with Roche's Actemra (tocilizumab), an antibody that&#xD;
      blocks the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), in COVID-19 treatment has led to&#xD;
      several anti-inflammatory trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that nebulised dornase alfa will break down the DNA backbone of NETs in the&#xD;
      COVID-19 lung which will promote the degradation of pro-inflammatory extracellular histones&#xD;
      and prevent the amplification of the inflammatory response and the resultant lung damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive data will enable rapid testing into a large clinical trial in the UK and prevent ICU&#xD;
      capacity issues faced today. Dornase alfa is a cost-effective drug and is currently available&#xD;
      for prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to test this hypothesis with this COVASE Phase IIa trial. We propose that all&#xD;
      people with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospital for supplementary oxygen, who showed&#xD;
      evidence of systemic inflammation but did not immediately require intubation and ventilation,&#xD;
      would be eligible for nebulised dornase alfa, a safe and cost-effective treatment, twice&#xD;
      daily for 7 days.&#xD;
