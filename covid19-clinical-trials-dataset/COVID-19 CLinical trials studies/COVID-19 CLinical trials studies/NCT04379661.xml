  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress and anxiety can have an adverse impact on health, and the experience of many around&#xD;
      the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 is affecting health and well-being. Individuals with chronic&#xD;
      disease such as multiple sclerosis may be particularly vulnerable in some ways, but also&#xD;
      particularly resilient in others. This study evaluates the effects of belonging to online&#xD;
      support groups that meet weekly for 12 weeks to address the stress and anxiety felt by&#xD;
      individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study will also measure and explore the&#xD;
      effects of online support groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is a pervasive and debilitating symptom for individuals with MS, who are at much&#xD;
      greater risk for anxiety than the general population. The lifetime prevalence of anxiety in&#xD;
      MS is estimated at 48.9%, compared to 37.9% in the general population. The negative&#xD;
      consequences of anxiety for individuals with MS include impairment of work function and&#xD;
      workplace attrition, increased healthcare usage and healthcare costs, increased physical&#xD;
      disability (i.e., higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score), and reduced overall&#xD;
      quality of life. And while anxiety has been shown to be acutely elevated both before and in&#xD;
      the first years after diagnosis, individuals with longstanding MS also exhibit anxiety at&#xD;
      higher rates than the general population. Of note, women are at heightened risk for both&#xD;
      anxiety and MS, and lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased prevalence&#xD;
      of anxiety in MS. In the SUNLIGHT study, participants join a structured meeting in which they&#xD;
      receive content specifically focused on anxiety, its detrimental impact on individuals with&#xD;
      MS, and an emphasis on techniques to reduce anxiety. Over the 12-week period of the&#xD;
      intervention, participants learn techniques for stress reduction that can be&#xD;
      self-administered, such that the benefits of participation outlive the active period of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
