  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the efficacy of fluoxetine to prevent serious consequences of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, especially death. Becoming sick with COVID-19 virus or any other serious&#xD;
      respiratory condition is not fun. However, the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on&#xD;
      human society stem from its significant mortality, not the number of individuals who become&#xD;
      sick. This project aims to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization, respiratory&#xD;
      failure and death during the time it takes to develop vaccinations and other strategies to&#xD;
      prevent COVID-19 infectionPoor outcomes with COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization,&#xD;
      respiratory failure, organ failure and death are associated with a dysfunctional exaggerated&#xD;
      immune response, called a cytokine storm, that is triggered by Interleukin-6 expression&#xD;
      (IL-6) and seems to occur around day 5 to 7 of symptoms. Fluoxetine has extraordinarily&#xD;
      strong evidence in its action as a blocker of IL-6 and cytokine storms in both animal models&#xD;
      of infection and in human illness such as rheumatoid arthritis and others. This action of&#xD;
      fluoxetine is an entirely separate pathway than the serotonergic pathway that allows&#xD;
      fluoxetine to act as an antidepressant. This pathway has been demonstrated in cell culture,&#xD;
      in animal models, in human illness and by novel bioinformatics analyses of protein&#xD;
      transcripts to be relatively unique for fluoxetine and appears to be a novel pathway. This&#xD;
      project aims to inhibit the increase in IL-6 expression and thereby prevent the cytokine&#xD;
      storm that causes poor outcomes. Patients who have tested positive or are presumptively&#xD;
      positive for COVID-19 will be entered into the study and given the option to start the&#xD;
      medication fluoxetine, which is demonstrated to prevent IL-6 surges in infectious and&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions. Participants will be monitored daily for COVID-19 symptoms and&#xD;
      weekly for side effects and tolerance of fluoxetine. A subset of patients will have blood&#xD;
      drawn weekly and stored to monitor IL-6 and other cytokine levels at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to reduce the serious outcomes of COVID-19 infection by preventing or&#xD;
      inhibiting the cytokine storm associated with organ failure, respiratory failure and death.&#xD;
