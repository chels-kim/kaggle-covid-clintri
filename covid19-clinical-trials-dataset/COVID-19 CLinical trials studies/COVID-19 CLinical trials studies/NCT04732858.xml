  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required a rapid surge of healthcare&#xD;
      capacity to face a growing number of critically ill patients. For this reason, a support&#xD;
      reserve of physicians, including surgeons, were required to be reassigned to offer support.&#xD;
      Given the time shortage for trainers and trainees, time and cost-efficient programs to gain&#xD;
      maximal benefit from short rotations for several physicians at one time are required 8. In&#xD;
      case of pandemics, blending face-to-face education to e-learning seems sustainable, with&#xD;
      online resources being scalable and more cost effective than other methods 9.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to realize a survey on the educational programs (hospital based or&#xD;
      web-based), during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on behavior change, satisfaction&#xD;
      and knowledge of the target population of surgeons.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the e-survey was to explore the effectiveness of educational interventions experienced by responders, considered as a whole &quot;bundle&quot; (and not one-by-one), among the surgeons exposed to a training program, on behavior change (Kirkpatrick level 3) in their daily role during their re-affectation within a medical COVID-unit. Behavior change represents a change in the daily role of healthcare professionals (for example, referral of patients with suspected COVID to the most appropriate screening and care pathway). For this survey, we considered subjective measures (self-assessment on a Likert scale on 5 modalities) of behavior change.</description>
