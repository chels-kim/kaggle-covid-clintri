  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pulmonary disease like interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive lung&#xD;
      disease (COPD) are a significant health problem in Canada and around the world. In addition&#xD;
      to the respiratory impairment resulting to a progressive dyspnea, these diseases are also&#xD;
      characterized by a decrease in exercise tolerance and muscle dysfunction which affect the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life. Respiratory rehabilitation is the cornerstone of the management of&#xD;
      chronic disease and it includes a set of personalized care mainly delivered in person by a&#xD;
      transdisciplinary team and with the objectives of reducing the symptoms felt by the&#xD;
      participants and improving their physical and psychosocial condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current containment due to the COVID-19 pandemic increase the sedentary behavior of&#xD;
      patients and prevents the holding of any respiratory rehabilitation activity. In this&#xD;
      context, tele-rehabilitation appears to be a particularly well-suited solution because it&#xD;
      would make it possible to offer a respiratory rehabilitation in a safe and effective manner&#xD;
      while minimizing contact with the participants. Although some studies support the feasibility&#xD;
      of this intervention, more data is needed to validate its routine clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to verify the safety and the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation treatments entirely at home via a telerehabilitation patform&#xD;
      developed at the Institut universitraire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ),&#xD;
      and document its effectiveness in people with chronic respiratory disease. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives will be: 1) to explore the effects of a telerehabilitation programm on exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, muscle function, functional capacity and quality of life, and 2) to assess the&#xD;
      satisfaction of participants and health care providers with telerehabilitation.&#xD;
