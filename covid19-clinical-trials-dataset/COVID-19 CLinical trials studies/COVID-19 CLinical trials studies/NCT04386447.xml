      Introduction There are currently no treatments with demonstrated efficacy for COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Epidemiological evidence points to the existence of intrinsic protection factors&#xD;
      which make young persons and women more resistant to the infection, whereas older patients&#xD;
      with multiple illnesses, above all with heart disease, are at greatest risk. This trial&#xD;
      proposes treatment initiated in the early stages of the disease, when clinical worsening is&#xD;
      most likely, with intravenous Oxytocin (OT), an endogenous hormone currently safely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The selection of this molecule is based on numerous experimental and&#xD;
      clinical observations, which show its activity in modulating resistance to pathogens, in&#xD;
      mitigating overall cardiovascular risk, and in acting on the production of Nitric Oxide (ON)&#xD;
      in the lungs, which is emerging as a key therapeutic factor for the improvement of&#xD;
      respiratory function in patients with SARS-COVID 19. Finally, OT is physiologically produced&#xD;
      by the human body, especially in the female sex and in the age ranges that coincide with most&#xD;
      resistant patients. In routine clinical practice, OT exhibits an excellent therapeutic index,&#xD;
      in absence of significant adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim To assess the effects of Oxytocin in addition to standard therapy, with respect&#xD;
      to Standard of Care (SoC), in reducing the number of patients who enter a critical stage&#xD;
      Secondary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality 28 days after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to mechanical ventilation during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of dependency on oxygen supply&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temporal trend of clinical improvement (7-category ordinal scale)&#xD;

      Intervention In addition to standard treatment, patients in the experimental arm will receive&#xD;
      intravenous OT with dilution of 25 UI or 40 UI OT in 500cc physiological solution NaCl 9%. OT&#xD;
      will be administered with continuous pump infusion with 62,5 ml/h. The clinician will have&#xD;
      the option to decrease infusion speed based on significant variations in arterial pressure,&#xD;
      otherwise, the total 25 UI or 40 UI amount will be infused in 8 hours. Treatment duration&#xD;
      will be 10 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care (SoC). Standard of Care will comply with the indications of the&#xD;
      Emilia-Romagna Region for the treatment of covid-19, and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen supply or non-invasive ventilation to target peripheral blood saturation &gt; 94%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydroxychloroquine 200mg b.i.d w/o an initial 1-2 days loading dose of 400 mg bid for&#xD;
           1-2 days (the dose may be reduced in patients with advanced CKD according to local&#xD;
           protocols) or remdesivir 200 mg in.v on day 1, followed by a 100 mg q.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiretroviral therapy (usually for 5 days) with lopinavir / ritonavir or darunavir /&#xD;
           cobicistat is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Azithromycin 500 mg q.d., usually for 5 days, is permitted in patients with suspected&#xD;
           bacterial superinfection, paying particular attention to safety, considering reports of&#xD;
           risk of adverse events in association with hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steroids are not routinely recommended but may be considered in selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Phase II, multicenter, open-label, experimental randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      an adaptive design, aiming to assess superiority of Oxytocin administration vs SoC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptive design includes Stage 1, which aims to define the more active of the two&#xD;
      considered OT doses, verify endpoints, the target population and the necessary sample size&#xD;
      for the following Stage. Selection between the two considered doses (25 UI e 40 UI) will be&#xD;
      based on the proportion of patients for which one of the conditions that make up the endpoint&#xD;
      is recorded (see below). To this end, for each of the 2 dosages of the experimental agent, a&#xD;
      single arm, single stage Fleming design will be applied. Patients enrolled in this Stage will&#xD;
      be assigned by balanced randomization (1:1) to one of the two OT doses. The decisional&#xD;
      algorithm requires that in a sample of 25 patients, at least 20 (80%) do not worsen to a&#xD;
      critical stage (main endpoint) with respect to an expected 17 (68%) with only SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2, patients in the experimental arm will receive the dose selected in Stage 1. The&#xD;
      study, on two parallel groups, will use unbalanced randomization, because patients who&#xD;
      received the selected dose in Stage 1 will be included in the experimental arm to achieve&#xD;
      equal sample size between the two arms (60+60) for the analysis of final endpoints Sample&#xD;
      size Stage 1 - sample is determined according to the single arm single stage Fleming design&#xD;
      applied to each of the 2 investigated OT doses (25 and 40 UI). 25 patients for each dose are&#xD;
      estimated necessary to demonstrate a statistically significant difference considering the&#xD;
      one-tail test with an alpha probability of 10% and a statistical power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - determined using as comparison the test for proportions. From available data, it is&#xD;
      assumed that during 14 days of hospitalization the proportion of patients in the SoC group&#xD;
      who enters a critical stage (primary endpoint) is 30%, versus 12% in the experimental arm.&#xD;
      Using a two-tail test, an alpha probability of 10% and a statistical power of 80%, was&#xD;
      estimated that 60 patients per arm are necessary to demonstrate a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference&#xD;
