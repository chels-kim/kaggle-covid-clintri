    <textblock>
      In this study Investigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening COVID-19 infection manifest by pulmonary failure and a clinical picture&#xD;
      consistent with a cytokine storm syndrome. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in which 30 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to two study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo.&#xD;

      In this study Investigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection manifest by pulmonary failure and a clinical picture consistent with a&#xD;
      cytokine storm syndrome. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial in which 30 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to three&#xD;
      study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is patient safety assessed by serious adverse events associated with&#xD;
      clazakizumab or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are: incidence of intubation, time to extubation, length of ICU stay,&#xD;
      severity of AKI, need for RRT, duration of RRT, trend in C-reactive protein, and patient&#xD;
      survival at 28 and 60 days.&#xD;

We propose the administration of an investigational drug in patients with high predicted short-term mortality secondary to COVID-19 disease. 30 Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Confirmed COVID-19 disease (by Cobas Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2&#xD;
             real time RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal swab sample, or equivalent test available to be&#xD;
             performed by the Johns Hopkins Medical Laboratories Services). Effort will be made to&#xD;
             have the confirmatory test result &lt;72 hours prior to enrollment however given overall&#xD;
             clinical demand this may not be feasible in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Respiratory failure manifesting as: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (defined by&#xD;
             a P/F ratio of &lt;200), OR SpO2 &lt; 90% on 4L (actual or expected given higher O2&#xD;
             requirement) OR increasing O2 requirements over 24 hours, PLUS 2 or more of the&#xD;
             following predictors for severe disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CRP &gt; 35 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ferritin &gt; 500 ng/mL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  4. Has a consent designee willing to provide informed consent on behalf of the patient&#xD;
             (this assumes that a mechanically ventilated patients lacks capacity to consent on&#xD;
             his/her own behalf. Should it be deemed that the patient has capacity to consent,&#xD;
             consent may be obtained from the patient.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Women of childbearing potential must be willing and able to use at least one highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method for a period of 5 months following the study drug&#xD;
             administration. In the context of this study, an effective method is defined as those&#xD;
             which result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently&#xD;
             and correctly such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception combined&#xD;
                  (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal,&#xD;
                  or transdermal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
                  (oral, injectable, implantable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;

               5. vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. true abstinence. when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence, such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  6. Men must be willing to use a double-barrier contraception from enrollment until at&#xD;
             5 months after the last dose of study drug, if not abstinent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Evidence of irreversible injury deemed non-survivable even if the pulmonary failure&#xD;
             recovers (for example severe anoxic brain injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Known active inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Known active, untreated diverticulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Known untreated bacteremia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Pregnancy. (The protocol will exclude pregnant subjects given the lack of overall&#xD;
             data on use of clazakizumab in pregnancy however the study team would consider a&#xD;
             protocol revision should more than 3 potential pregnant study subjects be excluded on&#xD;
             this basis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  6. Known hypersensitivity to the clazakizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7. Use of other IL-6 inhibitor investigational drugs at the time of enrollment&#xD;
