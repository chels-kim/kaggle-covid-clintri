  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to use &quot;network targeted sampling design&quot; to detect active and/or&#xD;
      undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the community and determine the spread or distribution of 1)&#xD;
      active infection, and 2) past exposure. The hypothesis is that there are many undiagnosed&#xD;
      and/or asymptomatic people in the community who may be unknowingly spreading the virus or&#xD;
      have been exposed and have antibodies. We propose to implement respondent-driven sampling&#xD;
      (RDS) which leverages effort on the part of seed or index cases to recruit contacts for&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

      Purpose and objective: The purpose of this study is to use community sampling to detect&#xD;
      active, undiagnosed COVID-19 cases and/or determine the spread or distribution of active&#xD;
      infection. The objective is to use a network targeted sampling design to direct testing to&#xD;
      yield a higher proportion of results which indicate active infection and possibly&#xD;
      differentiating between venues or communities where transmission is active and undiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study activities: A person who tests positive for COVID-19 will be given a set of &quot;tokens&quot; to&#xD;
      give to contacts that will entitle these contacts to make an appointment to receive a test&#xD;
      for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population groups: The population group will include people with index cases of COVID-19 and&#xD;
      their contacts for the past 14 days. As these contacts are tested and receive positive&#xD;
      results, they will be given tokens to hand out to their contacts over the past 14 days. The&#xD;
      network of positive cases will &quot;blossom&quot; to reveal community transmission and asymptomatic&#xD;
      cases, thus giving researchers an indication of disease prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: At the completion of each epoch and at the end of the study, we will scale the&#xD;
      social networks up and conduct network analysis using SAS and the igraph package in R. These&#xD;
      analyses will be applied in an ongoing manner to guide selection of seeds in subsequent&#xD;
      epochs to ensure representativeness and to guide selection of alters to encourage longer&#xD;
      referral chain lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/safety issues: The primary risks include discomfort from the nasal swab and risks from&#xD;
      the venous blood draw used in testing and the potential loss of confidentiality. All efforts&#xD;
      will be made to securely manage the data to ensure participant confidentiality.&#xD;
