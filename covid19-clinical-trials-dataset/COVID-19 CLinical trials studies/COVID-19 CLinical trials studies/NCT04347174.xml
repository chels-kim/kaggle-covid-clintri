    <textblock>
      The trial is randomized, blinded, two arms, active comparator controlled, clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard care as per&#xD;
      hospital practice versus standard care alone in critically ill adult patients suffering from&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, Eligible patients will be enrolled after due consent and will be randomized in&#xD;
      balance to receive either test drug (along with the standard of care) or Placebo (along with&#xD;
      the standard of care). The enrolled patients will be monitored for any adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      or serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study period. All patients will continue to&#xD;
      receive standard therapy till considered requisite by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard care for COVID-19, patients randomized to test arm will receive&#xD;
      single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Mw, intradermal, for 3 consecutive days while patients&#xD;
      randomized to control arm will receive single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Placebo, intradermal,&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration for each patient will be upto 28 days post-randomization.&#xD;
