  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a threatening pandemic, due to its rapid&#xD;
      transmission, uncertain risk factors for progression that lead to its lethality and yet&#xD;
      unsatisfactory antiviral therapy or prophylaxis. The respiratory system remains the most&#xD;
      frequently affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), with&#xD;
      patients either presenting mild illness as well as more severe complications such as acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission in Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      (ICU). Unfortunately, the remaining patients progress to a second phase-called the&#xD;
      inflammatory stage-featuring ARDS, thromboembolic events, and myocardial acute injury. These&#xD;
      clinical exacerbation latter predicts poor prognosis associated with an exacerbation of the&#xD;
      immune system cascade; a phenomenon known as &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. In the context of COVID-19,&#xD;
      the hyper inflammation diagnostic criteria are partly defined. Early studies of patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 established independent associations between biomarkers of inflammation, such as&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, interleukin [IL]-6, ferritin and D-dimer, and severe disease states that&#xD;
      require respiratory support or result in death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to identify practical blood immune- inflammatory biomarker / ratio&#xD;
      that could be used alternatively to IL-6 for predicting severity of coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID- 19) in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another aim is to unveil the association of the pro-inflammatory profile as categorized by&#xD;
      the IL-6 levels in patients infected by SARS-COV-2, with disease severity and outcomes of&#xD;
      COVID -19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research confirmed that levels of IL-6 seem are associated with COVID-19 induced&#xD;
      inflammatory response, respiratory failure, needing for mechanical ventilation and/or&#xD;
      intubation and mortality. The importance of identifying Il-6 as a biomarker lies in the&#xD;
      potential use of antibody against IL-6 such as tocilizumab, which is currently used in the&#xD;
      treatment protocol of covid-19. The authors shared an encouraging experience of utilizing&#xD;
      tocilizumab medication, particularly in patients at risk of developing chemokine storm&#xD;
      secondary to COVID-19. IL-6, a chemokine, is an important biomarker of inflammation and has&#xD;
      been shown in studies as an important predictor of severe COVID-19. IL-6 is responsible for&#xD;
      elevation of acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      and hepcidin, and inhibition of albumin synthesis. The dysregulated production of IL-6 has&#xD;
      been attributed to autoimmunity and chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a systematic review and meta analysis to compare IL-6 in severe and non severe&#xD;
      patients. In clinical practice, it remains crucial to develop a scoring system that includes&#xD;
      IL-6 to assist clinicians in early recognition of patients at risk for developing severe&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating biomarker like neutrophil (NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR) as well as other&#xD;
      ratios are used to represent inflammation and the immune status and are considered a&#xD;
      potential predictor for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Interestingly clinical scores&#xD;
      like the CALL score (C = comorbidity, A= age, L = lymphocyte count, L = lactate dehydrogenase&#xD;
      (LDH)) have been used for predicting progression towards clinical worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding IL-6 levels to the CALL score proved to improve its predictive power and make&#xD;
      treatment more appropriate, especially in patients for whom decision whether to treat or not&#xD;
      with IL-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab is required. It should be recognized that the&#xD;
      CALL-IL-6 score could be difficult to reproduce in low- and medium-income countries due to&#xD;
      costs of IL-6 dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify new blood immune inflammatory biomarker / ratio that could be used&#xD;
           alternatively to IL-6 for predicting severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) in&#xD;
           clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the influence of the pro-inflammatory profile on clinical outcomes and&#xD;
           therapeutic efficacy as categorized by the IL-6 levels in patients infected by&#xD;
           SARS-COV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess potential associations with other blood inflammatory biomarker and the impact of&#xD;
           the inflammatory status on clinical outcomes.&#xD;
