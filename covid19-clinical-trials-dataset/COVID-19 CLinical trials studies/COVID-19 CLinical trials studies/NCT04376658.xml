  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess the determinants of health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes among survivors of hospitalization for Covid-19 in Brazil. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective cohort study nested in randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials (coalition Covid-19 Brazil initiative) originally designed to assess the&#xD;
      effects of specific Covid-19 treatments. Adult survivors of hospitalization due to proven or&#xD;
      suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will be followed up for a period of one year by means of&#xD;
      structured telephone interviews. The primary outcome is one-year health-related quality of&#xD;
      life assessed by the EQ-5D-3L. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      rehospitalizations, return to work or study, physical functional status assessed by the&#xD;
      Lawton &amp; Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, dyspnea assessed by the&#xD;
      modified medical research council dyspnea scale, need of long-term ventilatory support,&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and&#xD;
      symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-revised. Four&#xD;
      sets of variables (1-demographic characteristics, 2-pre-morbid state of health,&#xD;
      3-characteristics of acute illness, 4- specific Covid-19 treatments received, and&#xD;
      5-time-updated post-discharge variables (HRQL, physical functional status and symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and PTSD) will be assessed as potential risk factors for health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
