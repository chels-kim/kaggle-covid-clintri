  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A continuous infusion of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) will be administered to 80 patients admitted&#xD;
      to Critical Care because of signs of Respiratory Insufficiency requiring non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation. Measurements of respiratory performance and quantification of cellular and&#xD;
      molecular inflammatory mediators. The primary outcome will be the avoidance of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation with secondary outcomes duration of mechanical ventilation, avoidance of delirium&#xD;
      after sedation and association of mediators of inflammation to outcomes. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared to a matched historical control (no DEX) series&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be an observational study, with no randomization. To evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine on the time course of ARDS in patients admitted to the ICU unit because of&#xD;
      severe respiratory disease triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Patients will be&#xD;
      informed and asked to sign an Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine will be used as a sedative which is its admitted therapeutic indication in&#xD;
      our country. Dosing will be according to its sedative properties as recommended by the&#xD;
      manufacturer and regulation agencies. The only change is that we will study outcomes that&#xD;
      have nothing to do with sedation but with a possible positive effect on the&#xD;
      hyper-inflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the &quot;Orden SAS/3470/2009, of December 16,&#xD;
      2009. Government of Spain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting and Sample Size calculation We chose mortality as an endpoint to calculate sample&#xD;
      size although our primary outcome is to minimize the requirements of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Mortality of patients admitted to the ICU because of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) induced ARDS is&#xD;
      48%. Assuming a p value&lt;0.05 and a power of 80%, to demonstrate a 10% decrease in mortality&#xD;
      due to the effects of Dexmedetomidine 156 patients should be studied so there will two groups&#xD;
      of 80 patients (cases vs historical controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, due to the specific characteristics and the unknown duration of the pandemic, these&#xD;
      numbers might not be definitive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (see section)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administrations Dexmedetomidine continuous intravenous infusion will be administered at&#xD;
      0.15 mcg/kg/h as a start and titrating according to sedative responses up to 1.5 mcg/kg/h&#xD;
      (max admitted infusion rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other sedatives (usually propofol and remifentanil) may be administered as per ICU protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilation parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invasive /non-invasive monitoring according to protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The parasympathetic component of HRV will be estimated online by means of the Anesthesia&#xD;
           Nociception Index (ANI, MDoloris Medical Systems, Lille, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Management Patient management will be performed according to the clinical protocols&#xD;
      of the Critical Care Units of Hospital CLINIC de Barcelona regarding the management of&#xD;
      patients admitted to ICU because of the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Demographic data including age, weight, gender, height, medical conditions,&#xD;
      ICU severity score, SOFA score, medications, hemodynamic support, O2 fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides regular protocolized monitoring measures for the purposes of the study it will be&#xD;
      required:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine Acid-Base equilibrium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine hemogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily Citokine levels IL1b, IL6, TNFa, IL8, IL4, IL10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monocyte profiling Patient data will be kept anonymous except for the IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes to be measured are reported in their respective section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Analysis of the data collected includes the comparison of &quot;primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes data&quot; acquired to a matched &quot;historical control&quot; with the same severity of&#xD;
      ARDS from another COVID-19 + ICU patient with no administration of Dexmedetomidine. A &quot;p&quot;&#xD;
      value less than 0.05 will be considered significant in the comparisons with the values of the&#xD;
      &quot;historical cohort&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parametric or non-parametric statistical tests will be used to compare data from the control&#xD;
      and study groups, depending on the distribution of such data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the time course of the mediators of inflammation sampled in the first 25 patients&#xD;
      will be studied as changes from baseline. Mathematical models of the probability of each one&#xD;
      or many of them to be associated with the outcomes of the study will be generated if possible&#xD;
