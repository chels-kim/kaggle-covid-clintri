  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment for diseases that were considered&#xD;
      untreatable only a few years ago. Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have&#xD;
      been shown to repair damaged liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, skin, cartilage, and cornea in&#xD;
      animal models and several human trials. In addition to cellular replacement through&#xD;
      regeneration, UCMSCs mediate through paracrine signaling pathways resulting in immune&#xD;
      modulation. Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are believed to&#xD;
      arise from septic shock and cytokine storm that cause acute respiratory dysfunction and acute&#xD;
      cardiac injury. There is presently no cure for the COVID-19 viral disease; however,&#xD;
      multi-treatment strategies are being examined. During the past two months, four reports were&#xD;
      published that suggest, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful&#xD;
      immunomodulatory ability, may prevent the cytokine storm and thus reduce the COVID-19 related&#xD;
      morbidity. All studies reported that COVID-19 patients responded favorably to MSCs therapy.&#xD;
      These reports, taken together with the previous successes of stem cell therapy in animal&#xD;
      models, the investigators, a seven-institution consortium, propose to explore the efficacy of&#xD;
      UCMSC treatment in COVID-19 patients at Jinnah hospital, Lahore. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      administer UCMSCs in patients with acute pulmonary inflammation due to COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      with moderate to severe symptoms. In the first cohort of 15 patients, UCMSCs will be&#xD;
      administered with three intravenous infusions of 500,000 UCMSCs per Kg body weight each on&#xD;
      days 1, 3, and 5. The second group of five patients serving as control will only receive&#xD;
      standard treatment. During the 30-day post-infusion period, a battery of tests will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the UCMSCs treatment. In parallel, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a comparative study to determine COVID-19 viral count by quantitative&#xD;
      real-time PCR and through viral coat protein ELISA, developed in the investigator advisor lab&#xD;
      (Dr. Tauseef Butt, Progenra Inc. Philadelphia, USA) with the ultimate objective to locally&#xD;
      developing a rapid diagnostic assay.&#xD;

      Isolation and characterization of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (UCMSCs): Human umbilical cord tissues along with informed consent forms will be collected&#xD;
      from hepatitis B, C, and COVID-19 virus-negative women with healthy pregnancies during the&#xD;
      Cesarean Section surgery after completion of gestation period. The cord tissue will be&#xD;
      transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 200 units/ml penicillin&#xD;
      and 200 µg/ml streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with 4-5&#xD;
      changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15 ml PBS. The cord will be gently&#xD;
      scraped with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be cut&#xD;
      into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord arteries,&#xD;
      and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced pieces will be&#xD;
      incubated in 17.5 ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in serum-free&#xD;
      DMEM-HG) in a 50 ml conical tube for ~3.5 hours in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at&#xD;
      37⁰C. After ~3.5 hours, the digested lysate will pass through a strainer and will be diluted&#xD;
      three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two 25 cm2&#xD;
      flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37⁰C. The flasks will be&#xD;
      fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic solution) every&#xD;
      third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will be transferred in&#xD;
      two 75 cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UCMSCs at P3 will be characterized&#xD;
      using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be used for transplantation in&#xD;
      patients. Fifteen (15) subjects will be treated with three intravenous infusions (IV) of&#xD;
      500,000 UCMSCs per Kg body weight delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion.&#xD;
