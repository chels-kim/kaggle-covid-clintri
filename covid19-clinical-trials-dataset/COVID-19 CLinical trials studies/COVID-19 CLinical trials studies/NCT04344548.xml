  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy based on Adoptive Cellular Transfer (ACT) uses several types of immune cells,&#xD;
      including dendritic cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells, and NK&#xD;
      cells. NK cell-based immunotherapies are an attractive approach for treating diseases because&#xD;
      of their characteristic recognition and killing mechanisms; they are involved in the early&#xD;
      defense against infectious pathogens and against MHC class-I-negative or -low-expressing&#xD;
      targets without the requirement for prior immune sensitization of the host and are able to&#xD;
      lyse target through the release of perforin and granzymes and using antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cellular cytotoxicity pathways mediated by Fc receptor for IgG (CD16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of allogeneic NK cells&#xD;
      from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors in patients infected with&#xD;
      COVID-19 collected by apheresis. This allows us to collect cGMP PBMCs and immunomagnetic&#xD;
      remove several types of undesirable cells including B, T and CD33+ cells with enrichment of&#xD;
      NK cells that will be expanded in bioreactors with GMP culture media (AIM-V) supplemented&#xD;
      with human AB serum and GMP grade IL-2, and IL-15. After quality control verification the&#xD;
      final NK cell product will be resuspended in 300 mL saline solution for intravenous infusion.&#xD;
      Initially, we will enroll in this study ten COVID-19 infected adult patients with moderate&#xD;
      symptoms (NEWS 2 scale score&gt;4). Consent forms will be signed by the patient before the&#xD;
      therapy. Patients will be treated with three different infusions of NK cells 48 h apart with&#xD;
      1, 10, and 20 million cells/kg body weight. We will follow the patients for any adverse&#xD;
      effect, clinical response and immune effects by flow cytometry including markers for NK cells&#xD;
      expressing different markers (CD158b, NKG2A, and IFN-y). We anticipated that the release of&#xD;
      IFN-y by exogenous NK cells could attract other immune cell populations to boost the immune&#xD;
      response against COVID-19.&#xD;
