  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes are ground zero for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing homes are ill-equipped for&#xD;
      the pandemic; though facilities are required to have infection control staff, only 3% have&#xD;
      taken a basic infection control course. Significant research has focused on infection control&#xD;
      in the acute care setting. However, little is known about the implementation of practices and&#xD;
      effective interventions in long-term care facilities.The investigators propose an&#xD;
      intervention utilizing Project ECHO, an evidence-based telehealth model, to connect Penn&#xD;
      State University experts with remote nursing home staff and administrators to proactively&#xD;
      support evidence-based infection control guideline implementation. Our study seeks to answer&#xD;
      the critical research question of how evidence-based infection control guidelines can be&#xD;
      implemented effectively in nursing homes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 200 nursing homes with approximately 24,560 residents from&#xD;
      across the United States through collaborations with our stakeholders. Nursing homes will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two arms: 1) AHRQ-funded COVID-19 ECHO that includes 16 weekly&#xD;
      telehealth sessions addressing COVID-19 guidelines and best practices or 2) AHRQ-funded&#xD;
      COVID-19 ECHO plus an additional 9 sessions with a focus on CDC infection control training.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by characteristics of nursing homes to ensure balance among&#xD;
      the two trial groups, including size (number of beds),geographic location, and current&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection rate. Patient-centered outcomes (nursing home residents with COVID-19&#xD;
      infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and QOL) will be assessed at baseline, 4, 6, 12, and 18&#xD;
      months. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM framework to critically evaluate both effectiveness&#xD;
      and implementation outcomes of the proposed intervention. The RE-AIM framework is frequently&#xD;
      utilized to improve sustainable adoption and implementation of effective, generalizable,&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions like Project ECHO.&#xD;
