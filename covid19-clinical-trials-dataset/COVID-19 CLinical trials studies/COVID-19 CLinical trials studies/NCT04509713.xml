  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dogs are some of nature's greatest detectives, owing to their incredible sense of smell and&#xD;
      ability to be trained. Most of us will be familiar with seeing trained sniffer dogs at&#xD;
      airports looking for drugs and other prohibited items, but their skills don't stop there. The&#xD;
      use of medical detection dogs is becoming increasingly common, as they are able to identify&#xD;
      cancers, changes in blood sugar levels and even predict seizures. These are just a few&#xD;
      examples of dogs playing a key role in public health. Many diseases can alter the way humans&#xD;
      smell. A study undertaken by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and&#xD;
      Durham University has shown that dogs are able to accurately diagnose malaria. The&#xD;
      investigators know that respiratory illnesses can alter your body odours, and thus the&#xD;
      investigators plan to determine whether dogs are able to identify the novel coronavirus known&#xD;
      as COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 can present itself asymptomatically (i.e. causing no apparent symptoms), which could&#xD;
      lead to the spread of infection in the population. The investigators believe that dogs may be&#xD;
      able to identify asymptomatic patients, as well as those who have mild symptoms (symptoms not&#xD;
      requiring treatment, hospital stay or limiting normal activities). It is thought that a&#xD;
      single medical detection dog stationed within an airport would be able to screen up to 750&#xD;
      people for COVID-19 infection in just 1 hour, informing those who are infected to isolate,&#xD;
      preventing further spread of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether it is possible for dogs to accurately diagnose COVID-19, the&#xD;
      investigators must first collect samples. NHS staff and members of their households that are&#xD;
      eligible for SARS-CoV-2 screening, have been selected to participate in this study due to&#xD;
      their potential exposure to this disease agent. In addition, participants from the general&#xD;
      population who are displaying mild COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 will be&#xD;
      recruited via hospitals, testing centers, outbreak testing programs and home testing&#xD;
      programs. Initially, participants will attend their screening test as planned or confirm that&#xD;
      they have had a swab test within the previous 24 hours. Immediately following this, the&#xD;
      investigators will ask participants to collect samples of breath odour and body odour, which&#xD;
      will be collected passively through the wearing of face masks, shirts, and nylon socks. The&#xD;
      investigators will ask to be provided with the results of the SARS-CoV-2 screening swab,&#xD;
      which will allow for us to determine whether participants are positive or negative for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. These odour samples will be grouped by positive or negative test results, and&#xD;
      transported to LSHTM where these will be processed in order to prevent contact with the&#xD;
      virus, negating the risk for dogs and their handlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study will be undertaken to confirm whether dogs are able to distinguish between&#xD;
      positive and negative samples using traditional sniffer dog training methods. If this is&#xD;
      possible, the investigators will proceed to the main study to determine the accuracy (known&#xD;
      as sensitivity and specificity) of the dogs' ability to identify the virus. Both the handler&#xD;
      and the dogs themselves will be 'blinded' to the samples, and thus unaware of which sample is&#xD;
      which. When the data generated by these tests is entered, it will be confirmed whether or not&#xD;
      the samples have been correctly identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dogs will be trained to detect and report the detection of the volatile odours&#xD;
      characteristic of COVID-19 infection. For quality control purposes the investigators also aim&#xD;
      to characterise the COVID-19 odour profile by analysing samples with a special process called&#xD;
      GC (gas chromatography) and/or GC-MS (gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry). This&#xD;
      will help to inform the identification of compounds showing differences between infected and&#xD;
      non-infected samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this work could be useful in the fight against COVID-19.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main study is designed to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the dogs to detect participants infected with SARS-CoV-2. Dogs will be trained for a period of 6-8 weeks to give a behavior response to positive samples. During training the reaction of each dog to a positive sample will be observed (i.e. standing, sitting or lying down) and this indicating behaviour reinforced by rewarding the dog. The dog's diagnostic accuracy will then be determined in a double-blinded study. Here the trainer and technician using the computer to record the results of the study are blinded to the identity of each sample until the trainer calls the final decision (positive or negative) based on the response of the dog to the sample.</description>
