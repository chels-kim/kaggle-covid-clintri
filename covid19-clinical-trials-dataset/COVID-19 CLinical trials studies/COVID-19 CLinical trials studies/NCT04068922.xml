  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is a major health concern among older adults and is associated with&#xD;
      increased economic, functional, and psychological burden. Resilience has been highlighted as&#xD;
      a crucial factor in positive health-related functioning, and a growing body of literature&#xD;
      supports the use of resilience-based interventions in chronic pain. Therefore, the goals of&#xD;
      this project are to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a resilience intervention&#xD;
      for chronic low back pain among older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is one of the leading causes of disability, affecting over 100 million people in&#xD;
      the United States and resulting in tremendous health care costs and psychological burden.&#xD;
      Older adults are disproportionately impacted by pain, with an estimated 60-70% of people over&#xD;
      the age of 65 reporting persistent pain. Despite this, pain management is frequently&#xD;
      suboptimal among older adults as pharmacological therapies show limited clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      a greater risk of adverse effects, and nonpharmacological (e.g., psychological) treatments&#xD;
      are often underutilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resilience is conceptualized as adaptive functioning in the face of adversity and comprises a&#xD;
      range of psychological, social, and physical resources. Increasing evidence suggests that&#xD;
      modifiable resilience factors are associated with more favorable pain outcomes, including&#xD;
      lower clinical pain/disability, higher quality of life, and enhanced psychological and&#xD;
      physical functioning. Although cross-sectional research supports the significance of these&#xD;
      resilience factors in pain adaptation, and positive psychological therapies have been shown&#xD;
      to yield improvements in health and well-being, strategies to augment resilience are&#xD;
      understudied in individuals with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a Stage Model approach,the aim of this project is to conduct a Stage I pilot study and&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of a resilience intervention for chronic low back&#xD;
      pain among older adults. Intervention modules will specifically engage hope, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      positive affect, and pain acceptance.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will initially complete a baseline assessment assessing study eligibility. The Resilience intervention consists of seven weekly 1.5-hour group sessions guided by trained clinicians. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these group session may be conducted through Zoom. Skills and content will be directed toward improving pain management by enhancing positive emotions, setting goals, learning to live a life according to one's values, and boosting self-confidence in one's ability to manage pain. Self-administered activities include the identification of personal strengths, pleasant activity scheduling, expressing gratitude, values clarification, mindfulness practice, goal setting, positive reappraisal, and noting positive events.</description>
