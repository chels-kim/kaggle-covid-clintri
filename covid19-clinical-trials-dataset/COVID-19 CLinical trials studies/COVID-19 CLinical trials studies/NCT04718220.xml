  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are a vulnerable and high-risk population, as COVID-19 is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk preterm birth, cesarean section, and maternal critical care. This study will&#xD;
      examine the factors that impede testing for SARS-CoV-2 (the causative virus among pregnant&#xD;
      women), help determine optimal testing strategies by evaluating the necessity of testing for&#xD;
      asymptomatic disease in pregnancy, inform prenatal care plans by assessing the full impact of&#xD;
      infection, and contribute to a provider's ability to counsel women and create prenatal care&#xD;
      plans if they are pregnant or considering pregnancy.&#xD;

      Pregnant women are a vulnerable and high-risk population, as COVID-19 is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of preterm birth, cesarean section, and maternal intensive care. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to: (a) evaluate the full impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy to&#xD;
      inform testing strategies, (b) examine the factors that impede testing during pregnancy, and&#xD;
      (c) use study data to devise implementation strategies that improve SARS-CoV-2 testing in&#xD;
      pregnancy and prenatal care during the pandemic. Investigators will prospectively enroll two&#xD;
      cohorts of pregnant women: 1) exposed (SARS-CoV-2 positive), and 2) unexposed (SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      negative as defined by antibody testing at the beginning of pregnancy, every trimester, and&#xD;
      at delivery). Women who initially enroll as unexposed but later test positive for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antibodies will cross over to the exposed cohort. In Aim 1, investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      patients' and providers' perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 testing during pregnancy and the influence&#xD;
      of COVID-19 on maternal care-seeking behavior and anxiety via surveys and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews. In Aim 2, investigators will determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during&#xD;
      pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in symptomatic&#xD;
      and asymptomatic disease. It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection will increase the risk&#xD;
      of preterm birth by 12%. In Aim 3, investigators will estimate the risk of mother-to-fetus&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission and viral presence in umbilical cord blood, placenta, and amniotic&#xD;
      fluid by assaying for viral RNA in the neonate, cord blood, and placenta. Collectively, Aims&#xD;
      1-3 will be interpreted by investigators, the Scientific Advisory Board and the Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board who will apply data to devising targeted implementation strategies designed&#xD;
      for rapid community dissemination to improve testing and prenatal care.&#xD;
