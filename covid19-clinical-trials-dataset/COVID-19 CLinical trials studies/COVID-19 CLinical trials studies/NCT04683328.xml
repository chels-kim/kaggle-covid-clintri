  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase II/III study&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the effect of SCTA01 on participant survival and clinical efficacy in&#xD;
      participants with severe COVID-19 admitted to high dependence or ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration of subject participation will be up to: 120 days Participants will receive&#xD;
      a single intravenous (IV) infusion of SCTA01 at Treatment day 1. Follow up visits will be up&#xD;
      to 120 days or early withdrawal visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, adaptive, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Phase II/III trial. It will be conducted globally. The study will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of SCTA01 compared to placebo both given with BSC in participants with severe&#xD;
      COVID-19. The subjects will be randomized by 1:1 ratio to SCTA01 and placebo group. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate participant survival from randomization to Day&#xD;
      29 between study group and control group. At the end of the Phase II part of the study, an&#xD;
      interim analysis will be performed for safety run-in and futility stopping.&#xD;
