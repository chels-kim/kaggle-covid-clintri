    <textblock>
      Due to enforced social distancing as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, many&#xD;
      on-site health care services are unavailable. This study seeks to investigate the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of an alternative on-line delivery model of exercise and education compared to&#xD;
      on-site delivery in patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the extraordinary events of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, finding alternative&#xD;
      delivery-models of treatment has come to the forefront of public health services worldwide.&#xD;
      Consequently, on-line treatment is rapidly becoming an integral part of public health&#xD;
      service. For patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), where non-pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment is considered first-line treatment, on-line delivered exercise has&#xD;
      already shown promise and may be a viable treatment option, especially when traditional&#xD;
      on-site exercise delivery models are unavailable. However, further studies are needed to&#xD;
      clarify the relative effectiveness of on-line exercise and education when compared to on-site&#xD;
      exercise and education programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of on-line exercise and education in knee OA compared&#xD;
      to a cohort of similar knee OA patients completing the same exercise and education program&#xD;
      through on-site delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes two cohorts of knee OA patients receiving the same exercise and education&#xD;
      program through different delivery models (on-line vs. on-site). The on-line cohort is a new&#xD;
      treatment delivery initiative, born out of the COVID-19 enforced shutdown of all non-critical&#xD;
      on-site health care. The on-site cohort is comprised of knee OA patients from a patient&#xD;
      registry, collecting outcome data as part of the exercise and education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise and education program is called Good Life with osteoArthritis in Denmark&#xD;
      (GLA:D), and consists of two to three disease-specific educational sessions and 12&#xD;
      neuromuscular exercise sessions (NEMEX-TJR). GLA:D originates from Denmark and has currently&#xD;
      been implemented in Australia, Canada, China, Switzerland and New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will primarily compare outcomes of pain, function and quality of life between the&#xD;
      two different treatment delivery models and will provide important insights in effectiveness&#xD;
      of alternative delivery models of recommended first-line care for patients with knee OA.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise:&#xD;
Exercise is performed twice weekly for 6 weeks. Each exercise session lasts approximately 60 min. and consists of three parts; warm-up (10 min.), neuromuscular exercises (40 min.), and cool-down/stretching (10 min.). The neuromuscular exercises include exercises for core stability, postural orientation, function and leg muscle strength. Exercises are performed in 2-3 sets with 10-15 repetitions with three levels of difficulty described. The exercises follow the standardized GLA:D exercise protocol. Patients are instructed in how to use alternative equipment at home for each exercise if necessary prior to the first on-line exercise session.&#xD;
Education:&#xD;
Patients attend two to three on-line educational sessions at the start of each GLA:D program. The educational sessions focus on disease-management and self-help strategies, including OA disease features and symptoms, treatment options, and exercise and physical activity as treatment.</description>
