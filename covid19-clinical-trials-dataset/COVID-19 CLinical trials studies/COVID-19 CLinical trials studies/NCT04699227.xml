  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and has since been diagnosed in over&#xD;
      a million persons worldwide. As this virus progresses, it causes an extreme and uncontrolled&#xD;
      response from the patient's immune system accompanied by reduced oxygen flow to major organs,&#xD;
      and subsequent ischaemic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment of COVID-19 is largely supportive without any cure or vaccine available&#xD;
      at this time. Developing new methods to reduce this heightened inflammatory response is&#xD;
      essential to halting progression of COVID-19 in patients and reducing the severity of damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cellular mechanisms seen in COVID-19 are similar to those seen in patients with sepsis. A&#xD;
      process known as Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is an intervention which has been shown&#xD;
      to prevent cellular injury including those associated with sepsis. Based on the evidence from&#xD;
      studies looking at sepsis, it is anticipated the same benefit would be seen in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC is a simple, non-invasive procedure where a blood pressure cuff is applied to the arm for&#xD;
      repeated cycles of inflating and deflating (typically 3-5 cycles of 5 minutes each). This&#xD;
      process activates pro-survival mechanisms in the body to protect vital organs and improve the&#xD;
      immune system. Therefore, we believe it represents an exciting strategy to protect organs&#xD;
      against reduced blood flow and extreme immune response, as seen in COVID-19 infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has an early phase and a late, with rapid progression to ARDS (due to cytokine&#xD;
      storm), multi-organ failure and death. Suppressing these cytokine elevations maybe a key to&#xD;
      improved outcomes. Acute and Chronic (repeated) RIC has been shown to benefit in reducing the&#xD;
      levels cytokines following LPS-induced sepsis in animal models (1). Furthermore, mortality&#xD;
      was significantly reduced, following chronic RIC administration as opposed to acute RIC&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC in COVID-19 patients is a pilot, multi-centre, randomised study, designed to ascertain&#xD;
      whether RIC decreases the severity of inflammatory markers associated with a &quot;storm&quot; score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 adult patients admitted to either The Royal Free or The Lister Hospital (Stevenage) with&#xD;
      diagnosed COVID-19 will be enrolled into the study, of confirmed but not critical status.&#xD;
      After enrolment, patients will be randomised (n = 10 per group) 1:1 to receive RIC or no&#xD;
      adjunctive intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC will consist of 3-4 cycles of cuff inflations to 200 mmHg for 5 min with deflation to 0&#xD;
      mmHg for another 5 min, which is automatically administered by the pre-programmed cuff. Those&#xD;
      randomised to the control group will have the blood pressure cuff placed on the arm, but it&#xD;
      will not be inflated. RIC will be performed daily for 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood will be collected following RIC administration (where possible) and saved for&#xD;
      the subsequent measurement of inflammatory markers such as TNF, IL-1Î², IL-6, and HMGB1 in&#xD;
      addition to cardiac biomarkers Troponin T and NT pro terminal BNP. All biomarker analysis&#xD;
      will occur at The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, UCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint is area under the curve of inflammatory markers and cardiac biomarkers.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint will be the need for intensive care admission or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be our intention to use autoRIC devices (CellAegis, Canada) to ascertain whether RIC&#xD;
      can lower the cytokine response. These devices are specifically designed, blood-pressure&#xD;
      cuffs pre-programmed for the number of uses required by each patient; the intent being &quot;a&#xD;
      single patient-multiple use&quot; cuff.&#xD;
