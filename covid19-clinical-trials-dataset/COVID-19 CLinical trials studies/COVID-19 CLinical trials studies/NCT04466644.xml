  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late December 2019, a new coronavirus strain emerged causing coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID19). Since then, COVID19 has become a global pandemic outbreak being declared a &quot;public&#xD;
      health emergency of international concern&quot; by the International Health Regulations Emergency&#xD;
      Committee of the WHO on January 30, 2020. Several emergency measures have been implemented in&#xD;
      different countries such as lockdown, social distancing, and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic concerns to public worldwide but also to couples aiming to conceive through&#xD;
      natural means or undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The American Society of&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) as well as European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology&#xD;
      (ESHRE) have recommend a precautionary approach and advise that all fertility patients&#xD;
      considering or planning treatment, even if they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, should avoid becoming pregnant at this time until more is known about the&#xD;
      virus. Therefore, new cycles for infertility patients as well as non-medically urgent gamete&#xD;
      preservation treatments, such as social egg freezing, have been suspended deferring embryo&#xD;
      transfer in those patients with initiated cycles. In this moment, when reopening phases are&#xD;
      being undertaken in most countries, the decision to resume the In vitro fertilization (IVF)&#xD;
      treatment in a safe environment to the healthcare workers and patients is the biggest concern&#xD;
      of the ART clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to describe the percentage of COVID-19 condition (naïve, immune, and&#xD;
      currently infected) in asymptomatic individuals from two different ART centres. For this&#xD;
      purpose, the ART centres' personnel and patients will be tested for COVID-19 before resume&#xD;
      the clinic daily routine just after the lockdown period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On March 11th 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic and on March 13th, the President&#xD;
      of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a &quot;national emergency&quot;. In order to fight&#xD;
      this pandemic, emergency measures have been implemented in different countries such as&#xD;
      lockdown, social distancing and testing. It is known that these measures have differed among&#xD;
      countries and due to the lack of tests worldwide, the real number of affected and/or&#xD;
      immunized people remains largely unknown. In this context, the daily most important surrogate&#xD;
      markers have been the numbers of infected hospitalized and deceased population. However,&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections are not uncommon (representing up to 30% of infected cases) and the&#xD;
      detection of this population seems crucial to prevent their potential transmission and to&#xD;
      guide the development of measures to control the ongoing pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive, prevalence study that aims to define the current contagious risk and&#xD;
      immune status to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection in two reproduction health centers in the USA&#xD;
      located in Utah and Massachusetts. Aiming for the better technical procedures available,&#xD;
      different biological samples (nasopharyngeal swab, saliva, and blood sample) from each&#xD;
      participant will be tested applying two different methodologies already approved by Health&#xD;
      Authorities, and nowadays the most commonly used for the COVID-19 diagnose: Reverse&#xD;
      Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for the analysis of the nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs and saliva samples and Immunoassay by serology for the blood serum analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 400 participants, distributed equally between the two participant centers, are&#xD;
      expected to be included in 2 months.The total expected duration of the study is 4 months for&#xD;
      collecting, processing and analysing samples from participants (patients and clinical staff),&#xD;
      although the participation in the study will entail just a single visit (coinciding with the&#xD;
      same day of the samples collection). After that visit, no further interventions or follow-up&#xD;
      directly related to this study will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exported from the clinical histories and source documents will be duly codified to&#xD;
      protect the clinical and personal information of patients in accordance with the current&#xD;
      legislation. This information will be exported to an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) for&#xD;
      its analysis. Given the exceptional situation that the world is facing with the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, U.S. authorities demand the report of all tested cases, so patient´s data will be&#xD;
      communicated to the U.S. national health authorities when the result of the test is positive.&#xD;
