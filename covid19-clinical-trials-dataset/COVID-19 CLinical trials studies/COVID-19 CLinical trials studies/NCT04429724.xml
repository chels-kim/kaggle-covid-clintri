  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the SARS-Cov2 epidemic is a major public health issue, both in the community&#xD;
      and in the hospital sector. Because of their central position in the management of patients&#xD;
      infected with COVID-19, hospital staff may be considered at high risk of infection. The&#xD;
      development of serological tests makes it possible to reliably document a contamination,&#xD;
      symptomatic or not, that is more than 3 weeks old. These tests, combined with clinical&#xD;
      questioning of the symptoms, make it possible to determine the proportion of asymptomatic&#xD;
      infections whose impact in the transmission of this disease appears to be major. The duration&#xD;
      of the presence of the antibodies that are hoped to neutralize after infection with CoV2-SARS&#xD;
      remains uncertain. Documenting the evolution of antibody levels and their monitoring in a&#xD;
      population at high risk of re-exposure to CoV2-SARS is a major issue in understanding this&#xD;
      disease and in assessing the risk of infection among healthcare workers.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, prospective, interventional, low-risk, low-constraint, biological&#xD;
      collection study to assess the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three blood samples will be taken at day 1, month 3 and month 6. The blood samples will be&#xD;
      stored in a serum biological collection. A prospective data collection will be set up at the&#xD;
      level of symptoms and co-morbidities at each collection at D1, M3 and M6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of the appearance of symptoms between samples, a self-questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed by the participating personnel as well as an invitation to screening by RT-PCR SARS&#xD;
      Cov2 according to standard practices in force at the national level as well as an additional&#xD;
      serological test.&#xD;
