    <textblock>
      A 2-part, multicenter, Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upamostat in adult patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      disease who do not require inpatient care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be seen in a medical facility (ER or COVID-19 clinic) for initial evaluation.&#xD;
      Consenting, PCR-positive patients not in need of hospitalization per investigator assessment&#xD;
      and who meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment and&#xD;
      provided with medication and home monitoring devices, and instructed in drug administration&#xD;
      and use of the devices. They will take medication daily for two weeks, complete a&#xD;
      smartphone-based questionnaire, provide additional monitoring information via devices&#xD;
      provided periodically over an 8-week period. Patients will be seen at home by a study nurse&#xD;
      after 2, 4 and 8 weeks on study; additional televisits will also be conducted. At the home&#xD;
      visits nasal swab specimens for COVID-19 PCR and blood specimens for safety labs and disease&#xD;
      markers will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part A of the study, patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of two doses of upamostat or&#xD;
      placebo. Based on safety results of part A, a dose for part B will be selected, and patients&#xD;
      will be randomized 3:2 to active vs placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Part A - Determination of the safety and tolerability of two dose levels and selection of an upamostat dose for part B</measure>
    <time_frame>57 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be determined based on the relative incidence and severity (CTCAE v 5.0 criteria) of adverse events, both clinical and laboratory (SOC=investigations) in each active treatment group as compared to placebo. In addition, toxicities (i.e., adverse events considered at lease possible related to study medication) resulting in dose reductions or discontinuation of therapy will be tabulated and compared among treatment groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B - Comparison between upamostat and placebo in time to sustained recovery from symptomatic illness. Sustained recovery is recovery, per below definition, maintained for at least 28 days or through end of study, whichever comes first.</measure>
    <time_frame>57 days</time_frame>
    <description>A patient will be considered to have recovered once he or she meets the following criteria:&#xD;
is afebrile (&lt;38.0Â° C core temperature) for at least 48 hours without use of antipyretics;&#xD;
all symptoms have resolved or returned to pre- illness levels (e.g., if patient had respiratory compromise prior to the onset of COVID-19), except for:&#xD;
fatigue, anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia, which may be persistent at level similar to that during the acute illness, i.e., the same level per symptom questionnaire;&#xD;
chest pain, cough or dyspnea which if persistent must be at least one grade lower than at the start of treatment and no worse than grade 1 (mild). A symptom questionnaire generally following the FDA guidance, Assessing COVID-19-Related Symptoms in Outpatient Adult and Adolescent Subject in Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biological Products for COVID-19 Prevention or Treatment, September, 2020, for both the terms and severity grading, will be used to capture symptomology.</description>
