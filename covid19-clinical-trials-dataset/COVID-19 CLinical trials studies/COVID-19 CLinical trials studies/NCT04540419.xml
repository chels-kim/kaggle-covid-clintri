    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III clinical trial to evaluate efficacy, reactogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      the vaccine Ad5-nCoV compared with placebo in volunteers at the age from 18 to 85 years，with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 500 healthy adult volunteers at the age from 18 to 85 years will be randomized&#xD;
      into two treatment (vaccination) groups in ratio 3:1 by double-blind design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in group 1 (n=375) will be administered a single dose of the vaccine Ad5-nCoV&#xD;
      (5E10vp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in group 2 (n=125): will be administered a single dose of placebo. Vaccine&#xD;
      Ad5-nCoV or placebo will be administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of the arm&#xD;
      at a single dose of 0.5 mL (1 prefilled syringe).&#xD;
