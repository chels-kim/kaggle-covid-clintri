  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the utility of the PCL Rapid Antigen Test for Coronavirus&#xD;
      (COVID-19) in a real world clinical setting. The PCL test has completed laboratory validation&#xD;
      and holds a European CE marking for in vitro diagnostic devices. These tests have been made&#xD;
      available to South West Pathology Services as a donation in kind by iPP (Integrated Pathology&#xD;
      Partnership). They have been widely used in South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the practical delivery of the test in terms of time constraints and&#xD;
      error rates. We will also compare the objective performance to the current standard&#xD;
      diagnostic test for COVID-19 and against a proven serological antibody test when a suitable&#xD;
      reference testing becomes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit patients having a SARS CoV-2 PCR swab test and ask for consent to test them&#xD;
      with the PCL antigen test in parallel. We aim to study 200 patients split across three sites;&#xD;
      Musgrove Park Hospital, Basildon University Hospital and Southend University Hospital. The&#xD;
      results will not be used to guide clinical decision making. Patients having a COVID PCR test&#xD;
      will be asked to read the patient information sheet and asked if they would like to&#xD;
      participate. The patients will be asked to have a second nasal/throat swab taken shortly&#xD;
      after their swab for the PCR test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be taken for whole blood or plasma left over from any routine&#xD;
      clinical sample to be stored as anonymised samples for future testing once a reference test&#xD;
      becomes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will report results of the onsite clinical diagnostic test and the PCL antigen test with&#xD;
      the number of the kit used, and test date. Anonymised information about year of birth, gender&#xD;
      and place of testing will be collected alongside date of onset, symptoms and immunodeficiency&#xD;
      status or significant conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be identified as they attend assessment areas or testing facilities hosted&#xD;
      by the recruiting NHS centres. They will be screened by clinical staff and identified to the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be taken by a clinical staff member or research staff member with the aim of&#xD;
      reducing the number of contacts with the patients and minimising the usage of personal&#xD;
      protective equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form gives the patient the opportunity to ask further questions. Only those that&#xD;
      are able to consent for themselves will be recruited for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to allow patients as long as possible to make a decision to participate but we feel&#xD;
      it is important if possible that the swab samples are taken during the same patient contact&#xD;
      (reducing PPE usage and minimising additional staff exposures). However there should not be&#xD;
      undue delay to clinical testing therefore we propose if due to clinical urgency potential&#xD;
      participants do not have sufficient time to consider the patient information sheet and&#xD;
      discuss the trial prior to the PCR swab being taken they can have up to 24 hours to consider&#xD;
      this information and participate if they wish to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be taken by a clinical staff member or research staff member reducing the number&#xD;
      of contacts with the patients. They will then be assigned a trial number used to identify&#xD;
      them during the trial. The consent form that will be photocopied and reprinted on clean&#xD;
      paper, with the original staying with the patient. The clean copy will be stored in the&#xD;
      patient's notes and the case record file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard COVID PCR swab will be taken and a second swab taken immediately after&#xD;
      for use in the rapid antigen test. As the swab process can be uncomfortable after the first&#xD;
      swab is taken for the standard clinical test (PCR) the participant's consent will be&#xD;
      confirmed again prior to taking the second swab required for the antigen test. After consent&#xD;
      the research team will complete an anonymised data case record form from the notes and&#xD;
      clinical management database. Participant's year of birth and date of onset of symptoms if&#xD;
      symptomatic will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From routine blood samples taken by phlebotomy or clinical staff consent will be sort to&#xD;
      store a leftover sample. This will be processed and stored by research laboratory staff. This&#xD;
      will be stored in an anonymised secure research freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory their swab for the PCL COVID19 Ag rapid FIA will be run on the test&#xD;
      platform. Following the test the swab will be destroyed as per local guidelines for&#xD;
      contaminated items. This will performed by dedicated research laboratory scientists.&#xD;
      Participant's results from this antigen test will not be used to make clinical decisions. We&#xD;
      will not be able to feedback participants' individual results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are expected to be in the study for total of 20 minutes total although this will&#xD;
      be spread over their patient journey so they have sufficient time to read the information&#xD;
      leaflet and ask questions.&#xD;
