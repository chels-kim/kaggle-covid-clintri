  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate (at the time of admission) biomarkers&#xD;
      of interest (Human Plasma BAK125 panel + interferon panel) for dexamethasone responders&#xD;
      versus non-responders in SARS-CoV-2 hypoxemic pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to describe and compare between groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of days without mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  28-day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the qSOFA score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in the extent of lesions on thoracic computed tomography scan between&#xD;
           inclusion and D7 (or the day of discharge from hospital if &lt;D7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in biomarkers on D0, D2, D4, D7 (NFS, liver tests (ASAT, ALAT), Creatinine,&#xD;
           Albumin, CRP, D-dimers, Ferritin, LDH, lymphocyte phenotyping)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate other biomarkers of interest from the usual management (NFS, liver function&#xD;
           tests (ASAT, ALAT), Creatinine, Albumin, CRP, D-dimers, Ferritin, LDH, lymphocyte&#xD;
           phenotyping)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in biomarkers evaluated by mass spectrometry (on a blood sample) on D0 and D7 +/-&#xD;
           2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial viral load (within 48 hours preceding D0) and at D7 of inclusion estimated&#xD;
           from the nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial SARS-CoV-2 serology and on D7 from inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The A38G polymorphism of the gene coding for Club Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP) for each&#xD;
           patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short-term complications related to corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quantitative and qualitative impact of corticosteroid therapy on lymphocytes from&#xD;
           patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter cohort of patients treated with the usual standard of care&#xD;
      including systemic corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone 6 mg / day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION (D0): The patients are examined on the day of their hospital admission. After an&#xD;
      initial eligibility check and if interest is expressed by the patient, a specific inclusion&#xD;
      visit is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP: Patients are clinically evaluated at least twice a day (Clinical examination,&#xD;
      SpO2, vital signs) during hospitalization. Chest computed tomography and SARS-CoV-2 serology&#xD;
      are performed on D0. Viral load is evaluated by the polymerase chain reaction which allowed&#xD;
      the diagnosis of covid-19 in the 48 hours preceding D0 and on D7. The evaluation of&#xD;
      conventional biomarkers of interest (blood count, hepatic assessment (ASAT, ALAT), serum&#xD;
      creatinine, albuminemia, CRP, D-Dimers, LDH, Ferritin) are carried out on D0 (before the 1st&#xD;
      dose of corticosteroids), D2 , J4 and J7. The evaluation of biomarkers of interest evaluated&#xD;
      by mass spectrometry is carried out on D0 and D7 +/- 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up call on D28 is carried out (telephone call, collection of vital status and&#xD;
      hospitalizations).&#xD;

The quick Sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score ranges from 0 to 3 points, with '3' indicating the worst health state. It uses three criteria, assigning one point for low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≤100 mmHg), high respiratory rate (≥22 breaths per min), or altered mentation.</description>

             investigational agent or procedure within one month prior to screening or during the&#xD;
             study; exclusion period determined by another study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is impossible to correctly inform the patient (e.g. language barrier)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of free, informed and written consent signed by the participant and the&#xD;
