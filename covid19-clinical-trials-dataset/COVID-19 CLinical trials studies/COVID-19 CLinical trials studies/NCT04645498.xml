  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No additional risk factors have been identified in patients with Inherited Metabolic Diseases&#xD;
      (IMD) for contracting or presenting complications of COVID-19 compared to the general&#xD;
      population. Yet, IMD patients have cell/tissue alterations that could constitute a potential&#xD;
      direct or indirect target for the virus. We do not know the impact of this infection on&#xD;
      patients suffering from MHM, nor the possible effect of specific treatment of MHM on the&#xD;
      evolution of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect French IMD patients having or having had COVID-19 infection. The main&#xD;
      objective is to estimate among IMD patients contracting COVID-19 the frequency of disease&#xD;
      aggravation or metabolic decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be : a. to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 diagnosed in a&#xD;
      given group of IMD when the number of patients with this IMD is known (Urea Cycle Deficiency,&#xD;
      Gaucher Disease). b. to evaluate the impact of IMD on the and severity of COVID-19 infection&#xD;

        with MHM who have been infected with COVID-19 (tested positive or considered positive for&#xD;
        COVID-19). Asymptomatic MHM patients tested positive for COVID 19 (contact case, for&#xD;
        example) will also be studied.&#xD;
