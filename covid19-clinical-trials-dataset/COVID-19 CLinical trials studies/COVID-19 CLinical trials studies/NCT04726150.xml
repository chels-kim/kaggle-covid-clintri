  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 can cause myocarditis, which can cause myocardial fibrosis. This has been shown to&#xD;
      increase mortality and morbidity among athletes. Several efforts have been made to guide&#xD;
      sports participation after COVID-19, but not much scientific evidence is present to back-up&#xD;
      those guidelines. The current initiative aims gain a heightened insight in this matter.To&#xD;
      identify the presence of fibrosis athletes who recovered from COVID-19 will undergo CMR&#xD;
      (Cardiac MRI). All athletes will also undergo echocardiography, 5-day Holtermonitoring among&#xD;
      others. This will allow to determine whether differences between those with and those without&#xD;
      fibrosis are present. If fibrosis is present, athletes will be offered an implantation of a&#xD;
      very small monitoring device that will be able to detect arrhythmias with a much higher&#xD;
      sensitivity. Also an exercise echocardiography will be performed, to determine the safety of&#xD;
      continuation of athletic efforts.&#xD;

      Baseline investigations will depend on the clinical presentation of the athlete. Three groups&#xD;
      are identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic: anosmia, ageusia, headache, mild fatigue, fever ≤3d,&#xD;
           myalgias ≤3d , mild upper respiratory tract illness, and mild gastrointestinal illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate to severe symptoms: at least 2 of: persistent fever ≥4d, chills ≥4d, myalgias&#xD;
           ≥4d, lethargy impairing activities of daily life (ADL) ≥4d, dyspnea during ADL ≥4d, and&#xD;
           chest tightness ≥4d. Or cardiac symptoms: dyspnea, exercise intolerance, chest&#xD;
           tightness, dizziness, (pre)syncope, and (new onset) palpitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalized: all athletes admitted for COVID-19, whether or not on the intensive care&#xD;
           unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1 will undergo a thorough history, clinical examination, ECG, laboratory&#xD;
                tests for hs-Troponin T (TnT) and hsCRP, echocardiography at rest, 5-day-Holter and&#xD;
                CMR. These examinations will take place at least 30 days after the first symptoms&#xD;
                or positive test. Follow-up will be performed as pointed out with the grey crosses&#xD;
                in the table. Depending on the results further investigation may be required (as in&#xD;
                group 2 and 3). This part of the study is interventional in nature (not according&#xD;
                to standard of care in those individuals).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Groups 2 and 3 will undergo a more extensive evaluation: a thorough history,&#xD;
                clinical examination, ECG, laboratory tests for hs-TnT and hsCRP, echocardiography&#xD;
                at rest, CardioPulmonary Exercise Test (CPET), 5-day-Holter, late potentials and&#xD;
                CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If in any athlete the CMR shows signs of fibrosis or myocarditis, an exercise&#xD;
      echocardiography will be performed additionally. Those subjects will be part of a more&#xD;
      extensive follow-up schedule (both white and grey in the table) In the case of the presence&#xD;
      of a non-ischemic pattern of Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) or raised myocardial T2 and&#xD;
      normal of only mildly contractile reserve, implantation of an Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)&#xD;
      will be performed as a part of the study. This then will be remotely followed-up through&#xD;
      telemonitoring. Other athletes (and those who refuse an ILR will receive a 5d-Holter&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
