      Hydroxychloroquine is widely used to treat autoimmune diseases. Clinical investigation has&#xD;
      found that a high concentration of cytokines were detected in the plasma of critically ill&#xD;
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, therefore, hydroxychloroquine as anti-inflammatory agents&#xD;
      may reduce this response in accord with their use in autoimmune disease where the cytokine&#xD;
      response can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Favipiravir is an antiviral drug developed in Japan that the data sheet notes that it is a&#xD;
      pyrazinecarboxamide derivative with activity against influenza viruses, west nile virus,&#xD;
      yellow fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus as well as against flaviviruses,&#xD;
      arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses. In February the drug was used for COVID-19&#xD;
      disease in China and was declared effective in treatment, and a report published (in press)&#xD;
      comparing Favipiravir with Lopinavir /ritonavir suggested that Favipiravir was superior for&#xD;
      prevention of disease progression and viral clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to compare three arms: hydroxychloroquine; favipiravir;&#xD;
      standard care (no specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment) only, in symptomatic patients infected by&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in an open label randomized clinical trial. The difference between groups will&#xD;
      allow an effect size to be determined for a definitive clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) and has developed into a pandemic with serious global&#xD;
      public health and economic sequelae. As of June 30, 2020 over 10,000,000 cases have been&#xD;
      confirmed worldwide leading to over 500,000 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).&#xD;
      Currently no vaccine exists, however chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been documented&#xD;
      as potentially having antiviral properties with efficacy against COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
      Chloroquine is used in the treatment of malaria and amebiasis and is still used in the&#xD;
      prophylaxis of malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is a derivative of Chloroquine that has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to be much less (~40%) toxic than Chloroquine in animals.&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, due to its immunomodulatory&#xD;
      properties, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, with an excellent&#xD;
      safety profile. In vitro studies have suggested that their mode of action in COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      is blockade of SARS-CoV-2 transport from endosomes to endolysosomes, which appears to be a&#xD;
      requirement to release the viral genome. Clinical investigation has found that high&#xD;
      concentrations of cytokines are detectable in the plasma of critically ill patients infected&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that cytokine storm is associated with disease severity;&#xD;
      therefore, Chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine may reduce this response by acting as&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents in accord with their use in autoimmune disease, where their&#xD;
      reduction in cytokine response has been extensively researched and demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Favipiravir is an antiviral drug developed in Japan (as noted in the data sheets) that it is&#xD;
      a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative with activity against influenza viruses, west nile virus,&#xD;
      yellow fever virus, foot and mouth disease virus as well as against flaviviruses (i.e.&#xD;
      arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses). Its mode of action is through inhibition of&#xD;
      viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In February the drug was used for COVID-19 disease in&#xD;
      China and was declared effective in treatment, and a report published (in press) comparing&#xD;
      Favipiravir with Lopinavir /ritonavir suggested that Favipiravir was superior for prevention&#xD;
      of disease progression and viral clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The Solidarity Trial&quot; is a global pragmatic clinical trial being undertaken by WHO that aims&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy of different treatment modalities for SARS-CoV-2. An application for&#xD;
      Bahrain to join the study for collaboration has been made. In &quot;The Solidarity Study&quot; there&#xD;
      will be four treatment modalities investigated, including chloroquine phosphate alone,&#xD;
      remdesivir, lopinarvir with ritonavir or lopinarvir with ritonavir plus interferon.&#xD;
      Favipiravir is not included, and therefore this study will not be replicating features of&#xD;
      &quot;The Solidarity Trial&quot; but instead will provide additional and novel findings on favipiravir&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;

    <ipd_time_frame>Dr Manaf will act as the data custodian and is responsible for the storage, handling and quality of the study data.&#xD;
Data will be collected in the case report form to allow for cross referencing to check validity.&#xD;
Study documents (paper and electronic) will be retained in a secure (kept locked when not in use) location during and after the trial has finished. All essential documents including source documents will be retained for a period of 5 years after study completion (last patient, last study point). A label stating the date after which the documents can be destroyed will be placed on the inside front cover of the case notes of trial participants.</ipd_time_frame>
