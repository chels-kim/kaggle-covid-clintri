      The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 among the workers of our&#xD;
      hospital and the factors that are likely to influence this prevalence. It must be underlined&#xD;
      that our hospital is settled in two towns and both hospital sites had different missions&#xD;
      regarding the admissions of COVID-19-infected patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has widespread from China and put under strong&#xD;
      tension the health organizations throughout the world, especially since march 2020 in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, the French hospitals had to cope with a massive amount of COVID-19 infected&#xD;
      patients and, thus, their organisations had to evolve in order to be able to admit more&#xD;
      patients in their critical care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First studies reported an important level of inter-human contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      virus with an &quot;R0&quot; (basic reproduction number) superior to 3, which could lead to a massive&#xD;
      contamination of healthcare workers since they are directly in charge of infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies suggested that the healthcare workers are more likely to be contaminated by the&#xD;
      COVID-19 than the rest of the population, which pushed governments and hospital managers to&#xD;
      put in place individual and collective measures of protection in order to avoid nosocomial&#xD;
      transmissions and also to preserve the health of the hospital staffs in a context of high&#xD;
      tension on the hospital work force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are today few data about the contamination level among the healthcare workers of&#xD;
      general hospitals in France and about the severity of these contaminations. A national study&#xD;
      is being conducted but on a macroscopic regional scale. In addition to that, the proportion&#xD;
      of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 contaminated healthcare workers is not known as well as the origin&#xD;
      (hospital or community) of the contaminations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In June 2020, the French Health Ministry decided to launch a collection of epidemiological&#xD;
      data in the French hospitals based on serologic tests. Thanks to this action and with the&#xD;
      results of all the RT PCR tests systematically conducted since the beginning of the pandemic&#xD;
      when a healthcare worker had COVID-19-like symptoms, the Centre Hospitalier Sud Essonne has&#xD;
      decided to conduct an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 among the workers of our&#xD;
      hospital and the factors that are likely to influence this prevalence. It must be underlined&#xD;
      that our hospital is settled in two towns and both hospital sites had different missions&#xD;
      regarding the admissions of COVID-19-infected patients.&#xD;
