    <textblock>
      Molecular testing (e.g PCR) of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the&#xD;
      identification and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence reported that the diagnostic accuracy of many of the available RT-PCR tests&#xD;
      for detecting SARS-CoV2 may be lower than optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of course, the economical and clinical implications of diagnostic errors are of foremost&#xD;
      significance and in case of infectious outbreaks, namely pandemics, the repercussions are&#xD;
      amplified. False positives and false-negative results may jeopardize the health of a single&#xD;
      patient and may affect the efficacy of containment of the outbreak and of public health&#xD;
      policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, false-negative results contribute to the ongoing of the infection causing&#xD;
      further spread of the virus within the community, masking also other potentially infected&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As demonstrated by a study conducted by Ai et al., including 1014 suspect COVID-19 cases who&#xD;
      underwent multiple RT-PCR testing and chest-CT, overall 88% of patients had positive CT scans&#xD;
      while RT-PCR positivity was found only in 59% of all cases. Also, as reported by Yang et al,&#xD;
      the total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about 30% to 60%&#xD;
      at initial presentation. Thus, a negative result does not exclude the possibility of&#xD;
      infection and should not be used as the only criterion for treatment of patient and&#xD;
      management decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for false negative RT-PCR may include the lack of identification or inadequate&#xD;
      procedures for specimen collection, handling and storage, as well as active viral&#xD;
      recombination or testing carried out of the diagnostic window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From preliminary studies has emerged that patients may show very early but significant CT&#xD;
      changes even before RT-PCR studies. Hence, the necessity for developing a combined approach&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of these particular patients who present with negative RT-PCR test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypotheses is that several patients who presented with pneumonia confirmed&#xD;
      at CT scan during the Coronavirus outbreak, and who tested negative for SARS-CoV2 at RT-PCR&#xD;
      could probably be affected by the disease and need to be carefully observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point The primary end-point of our prospective, observational study is to assess&#xD;
      if inpatients who presented with pneumonia but had a negative test for Covid-19 are positive&#xD;
      at the serology for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points Among the other secondary end-points, the investigators aim is to find&#xD;
      if the combination of CT scan and serology could help in the identification of those patients&#xD;
      who were initially negative at laboratory testing alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary end-points are the efficacy of different pharmaceutical treatments against&#xD;
      Covid-19 that were empirically started in those highly suspicious cases and the development&#xD;
      of an approach useful for those patients who initially tested negative for Covid-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Before starting the study, the protocol will be submitted to and approved by the&#xD;
      local Ethical Committees at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS,&#xD;
      Catholic University, Rome, Italy. Before enrollment each subject will sign the informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: hospitalized subjects of both sexes aged 18 years or older with diagnosis&#xD;
      of pneumonia, confirmed by chest imaging and oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≤ 94% in ambient air,&#xD;
      Covid-19 test negative, given informed consent to data collection from the patient or from&#xD;
      the patient's legal representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: age lower than 18 years, pregnancy or breast-feeding. Nasopharyngeal swab&#xD;
      samples will be taken for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to make diagnosis&#xD;
      of Covid19 (2 repeated tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected include time of symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, diarrhea,&#xD;
      asthenia, arthralgia) age, sex, height, weight, education, alcohol and smoking habits,&#xD;
      morbidities, plasma glucose, creatinine, transaminases, γ-GT, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, complete blood count, D-dimer, lactic acid dehydrogenase&#xD;
      (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinkinase (CK), ferritin, HbA1c,&#xD;
      chest X rays, chest CT scan, cultures, therapy for pneumonia, other treatments including&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive and anti-hyperglycemic agents, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen&#xD;
      flow rate or other types of oxygen treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five ml of plasma divided in aliquots of 1 ml each will be also obtained and stored at -80°C&#xD;
      in anonymized way for future analysis, including third parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size If there is truly no difference between the standard and experimental treatment&#xD;
      (16% in both groups), then 260 patients are required to be 90% sure that the limits of a&#xD;
      two-sided 90% confidence interval will exclude a difference between the standard and&#xD;
      experimental group of more than 15% Significance (α) = 0.05 Power (1-β)= 90% Percentage&#xD;
      deaths in both control and experimental group = 16% Equivalence limit = 15%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation based on the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2 × f(α, β/2) × π × (100 - π) / d2 where π is the true percent 'success' in both the&#xD;
      control and experimental treatment groups, and f(α, β) = [Φ-1(α) + Φ-1(β)]2 Φ-1 is the&#xD;
      cumulative distribution function of a standardised normal deviate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The association between recovery and patient groups will be tested by means of a&#xD;
      Fisher exact test. A Cox Proportional-Hazard regression will be used to compare survival&#xD;
      curves (times to improvement) among the studied groups by correcting for the administered&#xD;
      therapy and for all the quantitative collected variables. Quantitative variables, measured at&#xD;
      hospital admission, will be compared among groups using ANOVA. In univariable analyses,&#xD;
      categorical variables, as gender, education, alcohol consumption and smoke habits will be&#xD;
      analysed by means of a Chi-Squared test to study their association with the recovery, while a&#xD;
      logistic regression model will be used to test possible quantitative predictors of recovery.&#xD;
      A multivariable logistic model, with a stepwise selection procedure, will be then used to&#xD;
      test all the variables that are significant in a univariable analysis.&#xD;
