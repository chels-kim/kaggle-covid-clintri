  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2000, various emerging infectious diseases have repeatedly caused serious impact on the&#xD;
      health of the global population and the healthcare systems. With the growing international&#xD;
      transportation and improving accessibility of the healthcare systems, hospitals have been&#xD;
      inevitably the first sentinels dealing with emerging infectious diseases. The biological&#xD;
      disasters, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Middle East&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korean in 2015, and the Coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19) outbreak this year, challenged our vulnerable healthcare systems and caused&#xD;
      great loss of lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the ongoing global epidemics and possible community outbreaks of the COVID-19, the&#xD;
      management of biological disasters for an overcrowded emergency department should be planned.&#xD;
      In the early 2020, the emergency department used a double-triage and telemedicine method to&#xD;
      treat non-critical patient with suspected COVID-19. This application reduced the exposure&#xD;
      time of the first responders and reserve adequate interview quality. However, for the&#xD;
      critical patients treated in the isolated resuscitation rooms, the unique environment limited&#xD;
      the teamwork and communication for the resuscitation team. These factors might led to poorer&#xD;
      quality of critical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a telemedicine-teamwork model, which connected the isolation room,&#xD;
      prepare room and nursing station by an video-conferencing system in the emergency department.&#xD;
      This model try to break the barriers of space between the rooms and facilitate the teamwork&#xD;
      communications between each unit. Besides, by providing a more efficient workflow, this model&#xD;
      could lower the total exposure time for all workers in the contaminated area. This study was&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the benefits of the telemedicine-teamwork model and provide a&#xD;
      practical, safe and effective alternative to critical care of the patients with suspected&#xD;
      highly infectious diseases.&#xD;
