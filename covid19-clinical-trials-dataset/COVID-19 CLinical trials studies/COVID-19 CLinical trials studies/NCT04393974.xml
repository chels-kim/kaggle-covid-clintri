  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routinely collected data will be used to assess the morbidity and mortality of cancer&#xD;
      patients following a positive COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2, (COVID-19) virus of the coronavirus family is believed to have bene&#xD;
      transmitted from animal to human. On 12th March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO)&#xD;
      declared this particular coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How COVID-19 affects people is still not widely understood. Some people who have tested&#xD;
      positive for the virus have been asymptomatic while others, who were otherwise well and&#xD;
      healthy before infection, have died. Currently, information obtained so far suggests that&#xD;
      most COVID-19 illness, however older people and people with severe comorbidities such as&#xD;
      heart and lung disease and diabetes, seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a retrospective, non-interventional study whose aim is to describe the&#xD;
      features of COVID-19 infection specifically in cancer patients; to investigate its severity&#xD;
      in this particular population and evaluate the long-term outcomes by means of medical charts&#xD;
      review of consecutive patients co-diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified from electronic medical records and entered into a pre-designed&#xD;
      database. All information used will have been previously collected as part of routine&#xD;
      standard of care and will involve but is not limited to: blood test results, prior and&#xD;
      current anti-cancer therapy, medical history and most importantly clinical outcomes, such as&#xD;
      response to any treatment provided for COVID-19 and patients' survival in relation to&#xD;
      baseline clinic-pathologic profile. All data will be collected by each patient's team and&#xD;
      will be anonymised and stored in a password-protected NHS computer.&#xD;
