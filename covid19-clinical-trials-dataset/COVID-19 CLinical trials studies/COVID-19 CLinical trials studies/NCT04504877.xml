      The objective of this work is to monitor the level of stress and overload of a group of&#xD;
      front-line health workers (physicians, nurses and physiotherapists) who will participate in&#xD;
      the care of patients with COVID-19 at Hospital das Clínicas in Ribeirão Preto and its&#xD;
      Emergency Unit (HCRP), for four weeks, and evaluate the cannabidiol - CBD's effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing stress for those who wish to use it.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Bonsai study is a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomized (1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio), controlled with general measures (supporting motivational videos, fitness videos),&#xD;
      participant and investigator unblinded, evaluator by phone will be blinded, single-site&#xD;
      superiority trial of oral CBD 300 mg daily for 28 days to prevent burnout and distress in&#xD;
      health care workers dealing with SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At 28 days, there is an open-label&#xD;
      extension wherein all participants are offered a 28 days course of CBD 300mg daily. The&#xD;
      objective of this work is to monitor the level of stress and overload of a group of&#xD;
      front-line health workers (physicians, nurses and physiotherapists) who will participate in&#xD;
      the care of patients with COVID-19 at Hospital das Clínicas in Ribeirão Preto and its&#xD;
      Emergency Unit (HCRP), for four weeks, and evaluate the CBD's effectiveness in reducing&#xD;
      stress for those who wish to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research intends to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the level of stress and emotional overload of front-line health workers&#xD;
           (physicians, nurses and physiotherapists) during their performance in the pandemic&#xD;
           caused by COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess whether the daily use of CBD 300 mg, for four weeks, reduces the level of stress,&#xD;
           during the period of performance of professionals in the care of patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess whether the daily use of CBD 300 mg, for four weeks, will modify inflammatory&#xD;
           parameters, such as cytokines, measured from the serum of professionals in the care of&#xD;
           patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess whether the daily use of CBD 300 mg, for four weeks, prevents depression, burnout&#xD;
           and Acute Stress Disorder and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the possible adverse effects of using CBD&#xD;

    <description>The participants will receive CBD 300mg/daily plus general measures (supporting motivational videos, fitness videos). All the participants will perform invasive and non-invasive procedures with the nursing team, the invasive being five blood collections, in their workplaces, to evaluate laboratory parameters, detailed in this project. The non-invasive ones refer to the measurement of height, weight, body temperature, and sleep pattern, as well as five collections of saliva, in a collecting tube, to assess viral load. They will also be monitored through weekly self-assessment scales, applied remotely, electronically (cell phones or computers), with an estimated duration of ten minutes each, which will have their responses recorded in an electronic database by the study coordination team.</description>
