  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic illness (CI) presents a significant and negative effect on quality of life and mental&#xD;
      health. Further, emotion regulation has been considered of particular importance on the&#xD;
      determination of chronic patients' well-being. Evidence suggests that Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an effective approach to improve psychological health in patients&#xD;
      with CI. Further, there is some, although limited, evidence, that self-compassion training&#xD;
      may be also useful in this context, and the inclusion of self-compassion elements in ACT&#xD;
      interventions has even been the focus of attention by recent studies. Nevertheless, no study&#xD;
      yet has compared the efficacy of these two types of intervention in CI. This is the aim of&#xD;
      the present project - to analyse, in a low intensity eHealth intervention context, whether&#xD;
      ACT or Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) present superiority over the other in improving&#xD;
      mental health and illness-related outcomes in CI.&#xD;
