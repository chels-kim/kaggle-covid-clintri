  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit patients suspected of community-acquired pneumonia at Haukeland&#xD;
      University Hospital, Bergen, into a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess if&#xD;
      provision of ultra-rapid, high-quality accurate molecular diagnostics with direct feedback to&#xD;
      the clinician can facilitate pathogen-directed usage of antibiotics, shorten antibiotic&#xD;
      exposure and admission time and is safe. Additionally, transcriptional and immune marker&#xD;
      profiling of patients will guide appropriate management through a targeted focus on the&#xD;
      individual patient's physical capacity, nutritional status and co- morbidities. The pragmatic&#xD;
      design of this trial together with broad inclusion criteria and a straightforward&#xD;
      intervention would make our results generalisable to other similar centres.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pragmatic, single-blind, single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) where&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients will receive standard of care microbiological&#xD;
      testing or standard of care microbiological testing and comprehensive ultra-rapid molecular&#xD;
      testing (UR-MT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will over a 3-year period (2020-2022), consecutively enroll cases of CAP&#xD;
      admitted (~900/year) to Haukeland University Hospital (HUS, Bergen). The study will consist&#xD;
      of representative patients admitted with CAP and thus, will potentially be generalisable to&#xD;
      hospitalised patients with CAP in Norway. As COVID-19 cannot be distinguished clinically from&#xD;
      other pneumonias, the study will therefore include patients with suspected CAP, including&#xD;
      with COVID-19. Approximately 1500 CAP patients will be screened to achieve a total of 1060&#xD;
      (allowing for a 10% dropout rate) enrolled patients that are randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      standard of care microbiological testing or standard of care testing microbiological and the&#xD;
      comprehensive ultra-rapid molecular test (UR-MT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the study are: adults (aged ≥18 years), with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      CAP (presence of at least two clinical criteria [new/worsening cough, new/worsening&#xD;
      expectoration of sputum, haemoptysis, new/worsening dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, or&#xD;
      abnormalities on chest auscultation or percussion] or one clinical criterion and radiological&#xD;
      evidence of CAP), requiring hospitalisation to a non-ICU ward, and with a capacity to give&#xD;
      informed written consent or consent provided by the patient's legally authorized&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include: lung tumour, cystic fibrosis, a palliative approach, patients who&#xD;
      decline to provide respiratory tract specimens, severe immunodeficiency, and hospitalization&#xD;
      for two or more days in the last 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on clinical evaluation and data of admission, patients will be triaged for severity&#xD;
      according to current risk assessment guidelines, as well as the CRB-65 score for the&#xD;
      assessment of severity of pneumonia. Randomization of CAP patients to the two treatment arms&#xD;
      (1:1) will be performed in blocks of size 4, 6, or, 8, occurring in random order, to ensure&#xD;
      approximately equal allocation over the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prescribed empirical therapy for each patient will be compared with what antimicrobial(s)&#xD;
      would have been appropriate for pathogen-directed therapy, based on the UR-MT result.&#xD;
      Appropriate pathogen-directed therapy will be determined using national guidelines&#xD;
      recommended by the Norwegian directorate of health&#xD;
