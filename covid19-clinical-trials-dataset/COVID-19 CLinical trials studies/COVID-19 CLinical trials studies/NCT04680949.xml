      The SAVE-MORE is a pivotal, confirmatory, phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) aiming to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of early start of anakinra guided by suPAR in patients with&#xD;
      LRTI by SARS-CoV-2 in improving the clinical state of COVID-19 over 28 days as measured by&#xD;
      the ordinal scale of the 11-point World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale&#xD;
      (CPS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic started in Europe, the Hellenic Institute for the&#xD;
      Study of Sepsis has launched in Greece the SAVE clinical trial (suPAR-guided Anakinra&#xD;
      treatment for Validation of the risk and Early management of severe respiratory failure by&#xD;
      COVID-19) (EudraCT number 2020-001466-11; approval 38/20 of the National Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Greece, approval IS 028/20 of the National Organization for Medicine of Greece,&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04357366). The concept of the SAVE trial was that early&#xD;
      recognition of the risk for the progression of patients with lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection (LRTI) by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 into severe respiratory failure (SRF) may&#xD;
      guide anakinra therapy to prevent SRF. The tool that was used for the diagnosis of risk for&#xD;
      SRF is the biomarker suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) at measurable&#xD;
      concentrations in the blood ≥6 ng/ml. The trial was designed to be open-label non-randomized&#xD;
      and the idea was το the start of treatment well before any sign of respiratory failure&#xD;
      emerges. Patients hospitalized at tertiary hospitals during the same time period as the SAVE&#xD;
      trial was ongoing and who were receiving the same standard-of-care (SOC) treatment were&#xD;
      studied as comparators. An interim analysis was submitted to the National Organization for&#xD;
      Medicines; number 108002/23.10/2020. In this interim analysis, 130 patients receiving&#xD;
      anakinra treatment and SOC were analysed and they were compared to 130 patients receiving&#xD;
      SOC. The 130 SOC parallel comparators were selected by propensity score matching to be fully&#xD;
      matched to the anakinra-treated patients for age, comorbidities, severity scores on the day&#xD;
      of hospital admission, i.e. APACHE II score, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), Sequential Organ&#xD;
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) and WHO severity, and for the intake of azithromycin,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone. SRF was defined as any respiratory ratio (pO2/FiO2)&#xD;
      less than 150 mmHg necessitating mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation (NIV).&#xD;
      The results of this analysis may be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of SRF was significantly decreased from 59.2% in the parallel&#xD;
           standard-of-care (SOC) comparators (n= 130) to 22.3% among the 130 anakinra-treated&#xD;
           patients; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence intervals 0.20-0.46; P: 4.6 x 10-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-day mortality was decreased from 22.3% in the SOC comparators to 11.5% among&#xD;
           anakinra-treated patients; hazard ratio 0.49; 95% confidence intervals 0.25-0.97%; P:&#xD;
           0.041.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of stay at the intensive care unit was shortened with anakinra treatment&#xD;
           compared to the SOC comparators for the patients who eventually developed SRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The median cost of hospitalization was significantly reduced from €2.398,40 among SOC&#xD;
           comparators to €1.291,40 among anakinra-treated patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No safety concerns were raised.&#xD;
