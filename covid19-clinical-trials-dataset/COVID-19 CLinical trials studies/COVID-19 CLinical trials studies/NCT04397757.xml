  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if this plasma can be safely used in humans with COVID-19&#xD;
      and to see if it improves patients' health as compared to not using it in patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

      This open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 1 trial will assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      convalescent plasma in severely ill, hospitalized participants with pneumonia due to&#xD;
      COVID-19. This study will enroll adults 18 years old and older, including pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 eligible participants will be randomized to receive either 2 units of&#xD;
      convalescent plasma collected from ABO-compatible donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and&#xD;
      standard of care (treatment arm) or standard of care alone (control arm). Participants in the&#xD;
      treatment arm will receive 2 units of convalescent plasma on Study Day 1 in addition to&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed on study Day 1 (pre-dose), 30 minutes after each unit of&#xD;
      plasma, on all Study Days while hospitalized, and Study Days 15, 22, 29, and 60. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo a series of safety and efficacy, assessments. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 8, 15, 29, and 60. Oropharyngeal or&#xD;
      endotracheal samples will be collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 5, 8,&#xD;
      11, and 15.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by PCR or other authorized or&#xD;
             approved assay in any specimen collected within 72 hours prior to enrollment.&#xD;

             Note - An exception must be requested to the Sponsor if â‰¥72 hours since positive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hospitalized in participating facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documentation of pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates by imaging (e.g.,&#xD;
             chest x-ray or CT scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Abnormal respiratory status that is judged worse than baseline by the investigator and&#xD;
             as documented at any point within 24 hours prior to randomization, consistent with&#xD;
             ordinal scale levels 5, 6 or 7, specifically defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Room air saturation of oxygen (SaO2) &lt; 93%, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring supplemental oxygen, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tachypnea with respiratory rate â‰¥30&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient or proxy is willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply&#xD;
             with all protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindication to transfusion (e.g., severe volume overload, history of severe&#xD;
             allergic reaction to blood products), as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness (acute decompensation) is&#xD;
             primarily due to a condition other than COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of other investigational therapy as a part of another clinical trial. Note:&#xD;
             investigational therapies used as part of clinical care, (eg, remdesivir,&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine) are permissible.&#xD;
