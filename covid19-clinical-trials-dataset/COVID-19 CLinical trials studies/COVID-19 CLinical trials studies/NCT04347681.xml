  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has started to affect Saudi Arabia and is expected to&#xD;
      cause a lot of morbidities and many patients, especially the elderly, will require intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) support to survive as its lethality increases with the increasing age.&#xD;
      Development of a vaccine by pharmaceutical companies like Roche and antibody concentrates&#xD;
      from convalescent patients' plasma by Takeda will take 10-12 months to complete, and we&#xD;
      speculate that it will be overwhelmingly expensive and limited in supply. We are presenting&#xD;
      this urgent proposal to use the convalescent plasma to save the lives of severely affected&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. Most of the logistic support is already available in MOH Saudi Arabia, and&#xD;
      it will be a cheap and quick technique based on the time-tested principles of passive&#xD;
      immunization which is supported by the most recent data from China. We are proposing to test&#xD;
      the therapeutic potential of convalescent plasma (from patients who have fully recovered from&#xD;
      COVID-19) in treating patients with serious COVID-19 disease or those who are at risk of&#xD;
      developing a serious disease based on their comorbidities profile. Convalescent plasma could&#xD;
      provide our first-line defense for people with Covid-19, especially those who are older and&#xD;
      at a much higher risk for complications. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with no available&#xD;
      vaccine or proven antiviral drug, antibodies from recovering patients could provide a&#xD;
      &quot;stopgap&quot; measure to help in controlling the pandemic effects on health and economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit at least 40 consenting donors and patients. Non-consenting patients will&#xD;
      serve as controls.&#xD;

      Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the&#xD;
      common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).1,2 The new strain of coronavirus identified in&#xD;
      December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, was called 2019 novel coronavirus&#xD;
      (2019- nCoV) and has been named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)&#xD;
      as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The ICTV have determined&#xD;
      that SARS-CoV-2 is the same species as SARS-CoV but a different strain. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) has named the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections as &quot;COVID-19&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include respiratory symptoms, fever,&#xD;
      cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection&#xD;
      can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure and&#xD;
      even death. It is not easy to differentiate between non-SARS-CoV-2 seasonal influenza and&#xD;
      other respiratory viruses including the locally reported MERS-CoV and H1N1 influenza viruses.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate (TR) with an approximate fatality rate of 3%.&#xD;
      Although most of the younger patients recover after milder disease, but COVID-19 is most&#xD;
      aggressive in the elderly population with worst pneumonia and death rates may reach 14.8%.4&#xD;
      Final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on viral detection (and if possible,&#xD;
      exclusion of other viruses e.g. by Respiratory Viral Panel). Laboratory detection of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV2 is based on detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary.1-5 For&#xD;
      example, GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit is the One-Step Reverse Transcription&#xD;
      Real-Time PCR Kit designed to detect the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) qualitatively through&#xD;
      Reverse Transcription reaction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. We will use this or&#xD;
      equivalent method to confirm the diagnosis and will repeat the rRT-PCR to make sure it has&#xD;
      become negative in a recovered patient. As of now, no vaccine or antiviral drug coming soon,&#xD;
      antibodies from recovering patients could provide a &quot;stop-gap&quot; measure to help in controlling&#xD;
      the pandemic. The concept of using convalescent plasma is not new. It has been tried in&#xD;
      limited numbers of patients during more-recent viral crises, including the 2003 SARS (severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, the 2009 &quot;swine flu&quot; epidemic, and the 2012 outbreak of&#xD;
      MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).6 Convalescent plasma treatment reduced mortality in&#xD;
      patients with severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Virus Infection.7 Patients with a&#xD;
      resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different&#xD;
      viral antigens of 2019-nCoV. Some of these polyclonal antibodies will likely neutralize the&#xD;
      virus and prevent new rounds of infection, and the patients with resolved infection should&#xD;
      produce 2019-nCoV antibodies in high titer. Patients with resolved cases of 2019-nCoV can&#xD;
      simply donate plasma, and then this plasma can be transfused into infected patients.8 Given&#xD;
      that plasma donation is well established, and the transfusion of plasma is also routine&#xD;
      medical care, this proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be&#xD;
      put into place. Indeed, the same rationale was used in the treatment of several Ebola&#xD;
      patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014-2015.9 Since the emergence of&#xD;
      this SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has rapidly spread across&#xD;
      China and more than 188 other countries and territories. According to the WHO, as of March&#xD;
      27, 2020, there have been 540,832 confirmed cases worldwide and 24,294 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 has&#xD;
      structural similarity to SARS-CoV that caused SARS and MERS-CoV.3 In the Kingdom of Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia, there are 1012 confirmed cases reported till now, with 3 deaths (on March 26, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Saudi government's prompt actions to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be&#xD;
      effective. However, CDC Estimates 40-70% of the US population will be infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Even with curtailment measures, judging from past pandemics, approximately 40% of&#xD;
      human beings will be exposed to COVID-19 over the next 2-3 years. Most of these infected&#xD;
      people will recover and almost all of them will be immune. Vigilance and readiness are needed&#xD;
      to teach the masses about preventive measures because older people and those with&#xD;
      comorbidities will be the sickest. Contemporaneously, therapeutic measures are highly needed&#xD;
      from the medical community to treat COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
