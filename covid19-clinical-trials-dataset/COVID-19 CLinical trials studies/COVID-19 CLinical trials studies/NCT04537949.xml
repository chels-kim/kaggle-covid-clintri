    <textblock>
      This trial has two parts. Part A, a dose-finding part, with possible dose escalation cohorts,&#xD;
      and discretionary dose de-escalation and refinement cohorts in younger subjects. Cohorts in&#xD;
      older subjects are optional and dependent on acceptability of dosing in younger subjects.&#xD;
      Part B, a part with expansion cohorts with dose levels which are selected using data&#xD;
      generated in Part A.&#xD;
