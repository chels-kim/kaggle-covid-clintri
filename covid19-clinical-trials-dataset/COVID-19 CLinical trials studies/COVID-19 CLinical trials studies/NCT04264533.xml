  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia, namely severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      infection (SARI) has caused global concern and emergency. There is a lack of effective&#xD;
      targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main&#xD;
      treatment for SARI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C is significant to human body and plays a role in reducing inflammatory response and&#xD;
      preventing common cold. In addtion, a few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is&#xD;
      related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothize that Vitamin C infusion can help improve the prognosis of patients with SARI.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for the&#xD;
      clinical management of SARI through randomized controlled trials during the current epidemic&#xD;
      of SARI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on&#xD;
      January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of&#xD;
      pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan&#xD;
      as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      infection (SARI). Up to February 4, 2020, over 20000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406&#xD;
      of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world.&#xD;
      Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI&#xD;
      has caused global concern and emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients&#xD;
      were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10&#xD;
      (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the&#xD;
      above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral&#xD;
      pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections,&#xD;
      there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment&#xD;
      is still the current main treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the&#xD;
      cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the&#xD;
      lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can&#xD;
      effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid&#xD;
      by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar&#xD;
      epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of&#xD;
      neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by&#xD;
      neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In&#xD;
      extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively&#xD;
      prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on&#xD;
      influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the&#xD;
      increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized&#xD;
      trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose&#xD;
      vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among&#xD;
      patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better&#xD;
      prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the&#xD;
      existing research, and the conclusions are different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    the study was started in the second half of the outbreak, and the number of qualifying COVID-19&#xD;
    patients decreased with the control of the epidemic so that we had to stop our trial before&#xD;
    reaching the predefined sample size.&#xD;
