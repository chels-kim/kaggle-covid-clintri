    <textblock>
      A first-in-human, phase 1 trial is to be conducted in a healthy adult population in the US to&#xD;
      assess the safety and immunogenicity of three ascending Nipah vaccine (HeV-sG-V; Hendra virus&#xD;
      soluble glycoprotein vaccine) dosages. Different dosing regimens and number of doses will&#xD;
      also be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, phase 1 trial in healthy male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant female adults 18 through 49 years of age designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of three ascending doses of HeV-sG-V. Different dosing regimens and number of&#xD;
      doses will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to accrue eligible subjects into three successive dosage escalation cohorts&#xD;
      consisting of 12, 72, and 108 subjects, respectively (total of 192 subjects). The three&#xD;
      HeV-sG-V dosages will be 10 mcg, 30 mcg, and 100 mcg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first cohort, subjects will receive two doses of the investigational product (IP) at&#xD;
      28-day intervals. Subjects will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio, with 10 receiving two doses of&#xD;
      HeV-sG-V (10 mcg dosage) and two subjects will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second cohort, subjects will be randomized in a 5:5:2 ratio with 30 receiving a 30 mcg&#xD;
      dosage of HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 2 (Days 1 and 8) with placebo on Visit 3 (Day 29), 30&#xD;
      receiving a 30 mcg dosage of HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 3 (Days 1 and 29) with placebo on Visit&#xD;
      2 (Day 8), while 12 subjects will receive placebo at each of the same visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third cohort will be randomized in a 5:5:5:3 ratio so that 30 subjects are assigned to&#xD;
      each of three different regimens consisting of a 100 mcg dosage of HeV-sG-V and placebo&#xD;
      administered as three doses, HeV-sG-V on Visit 1 (Day 1) with placebo on Visits 2 and 3 (Days&#xD;
      8 and 29), or HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 2 (Days 1 and 8) with placebo on Visit 3 (Day 29), or&#xD;
      HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 3 (Days 1 and 29) with placebo on Visit 2 (Day 8), while the&#xD;
      remaining 18 will receive a dose of placebo at each of the same visits.&#xD;
