    <textblock>
      In order to safely and effectively reopen businesses and universities across the US,&#xD;
      institutions will need to develop approaches to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases and manage&#xD;
      their spread while balancing program effectiveness, feasibility, costs, and scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the implementation of a COVID-19 screening program that coordinates&#xD;
      several existing systems at the University of Pennsylvania including saliva-based viral&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in close to 10,000,000 reported&#xD;
      cases worldwide, including more than 2,000,000 aggregated reported cases and 120,000 deaths&#xD;
      in the United States. Initial efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic were aimed at testing&#xD;
      symptomatic individuals, implementing stay-in-place orders, and at increasing hospital&#xD;
      capacity to meet surge demands. While nations continue to confront the current crisis, plans&#xD;
      for the future must be put in place tools to enhance our ability to conduct effective&#xD;
      screening, containment, and case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widespread COVID-19 testing is needed to safely and effectively reopen schools and businesses&#xD;
      across the US. However, currently approved testing options require reagents that are limited&#xD;
      in supply, severely hindering scalability. Emerging evidence indicates that saliva testing&#xD;
      with the option of at-home sample collection can accurately identify COVID-19 viral&#xD;
      infection. Additional diagnostic testing options will continue to increase patient access.&#xD;
      Moreover, this approach provides an option for the easy, safe and convenient collection of&#xD;
      samples required for testing without traveling to a doctor's office, hospital, or testing&#xD;
      site. Collection by the patient also reduces exposure of health care workers to the virus and&#xD;
      preserves limited personal protective equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With access to expanded testing, health systems and universities will need to test&#xD;
      alternative methods to manage COVID-19 spread while balancing program effectiveness,&#xD;
      feasibility, costs, and scalability. Insights from the field of behavioral economics offer&#xD;
      promise for designing and sustaining these kinds of policies. For these reasons, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to evaluate the implementation of a COVID-19 screening program that&#xD;
      uses saliva-based testing.&#xD;
