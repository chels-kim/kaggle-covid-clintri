  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-arm, phase II trial for rapid efficacy and toxicity assessment of multiple&#xD;
      therapies immediately after COVID19 positive testing in high-risk individuals. Therapies&#xD;
      include stand-alone or combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,&#xD;
      ivermectin, or camostat mesilate, artemesia annua. The hypothesis of this study is that the&#xD;
      addition of agents that inhibit viral entry or replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in&#xD;
      will be devoid of additional moderate to severe toxicities, will prevent clinical&#xD;
      deterioration, and will improve viral clearance in high risk individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease, caused by a novel&#xD;
      enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of this unprecedented outbreak &quot;pneumonia of unknown etiology&quot;&#xD;
      was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 8th, 2019 and reported to the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31st, 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global&#xD;
      emergency on January 30, 2020, and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11,&#xD;
      2020. As of April 22, 2020, more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and&#xD;
      182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China, according to the&#xD;
      data from Johns Hopkins University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness,&#xD;
      approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5% of&#xD;
      those have multi-organ failure or shock. The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4% and it is&#xD;
      higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancer. The vast&#xD;
      majority of patients present with fever (83-99%), cough (59-82%), fatigue (44-70%), anorexia&#xD;
      (40-84%), shortness of breath (31-40%), sputum production (28-33%), myalgias (11-35%). Less&#xD;
      than 10% of patients will present with headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat,&#xD;
      hemoptysis, vomiting, or diarrhea. Anosmia or ageusia proceeding the onset of respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms has been anecdotally reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, treatments for COVID-19 in high risks individuals remain experimental and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are at best supportive, with prevention&#xD;
      aimed at reducing transmission in the community as the best weapon. No proven therapies have&#xD;
      been demonstrated to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness and this is a&#xD;
      critical unmet need for high-risk individuals and warrants study. Recently, the Infectious&#xD;
      Disease Society of America has made recommendations for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19, focusing on inpatient care, and recommending randomized trials where possible as&#xD;
      the best step to improve treatment outcomes and to increase our understanding of this&#xD;
      coronavirus pandemic. Discoveries in this area may inform clinicians on effective treatment&#xD;
      for low-risk individuals who progress to severe illness, as well.&#xD;
