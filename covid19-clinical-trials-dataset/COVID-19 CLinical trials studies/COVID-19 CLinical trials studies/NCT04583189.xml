      This study compares the diagnostic performance of a nasopharyngeal swab antigenic test versus&#xD;
      the RT-PCR Covid-19 reference test performed with the AllplexTM 2019-nCoV kit (Seegene, South&#xD;
      Korea) in symptomatic children presenting at the hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, France, like the rest of the world, has been suffering from the pandemic&#xD;
      caused by SARS CoV-2, which has led to a considerable health crisis. Moreover, the scale of&#xD;
      this epidemic was unexpected for the scientific community and the public authorities, who in&#xD;
      fact had to find diagnostic and management solutions for COVID-19 most often in the short&#xD;
      term. The reference diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the RT-PCR technique, which allows&#xD;
      diagnosis in the early stages of infectious manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since the French recommendations allow widely and without prescription the access&#xD;
      the screening of individuals in biology laboratories, regardless of age, symptoms and history&#xD;
      of COVID-19 contage, the delays in both the completion of these RT-PCR tests and the return&#xD;
      of their results have increased and have become incompatible with relevant decision-making by&#xD;
      the clinician and control of the epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, since the end of August 2020, it takes about ten days to get the result of an&#xD;
      outpatient PCR test. With the increase in the circulation of the SARS-CoV2 virus and the&#xD;
      number of positive cases in several regions of France, the use of rapid testing for SARS&#xD;
      CoV-2 now seems essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another diagnostic method of COVID-19 is the detection of specific SARS CoV-2 antigens in&#xD;
      rhino-pharyngeal secretions and also allows early diagnosis. The qualitative detection of&#xD;
      specific SARS CoV-2 antigens by immunochromatography, from rhino-pharynges samples, has the&#xD;
      advantage of offering a result in about ten minutes. These tests use specific antibodies from&#xD;
      SARS CoV-2 to selectively detect the S protein. Initially these tests like the one developed&#xD;
      by the Belgian firm Coris Bioconcept were developed to identify positive COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
      Thus, they could be used as rapid screening for screening and would be an alternative to&#xD;
      RT-PCR. Their sensitivity varies according to manufacturers and especially according to the&#xD;
      viral load between 60% and 90% with a specificity of more than 99%. The sensitivity of this&#xD;
      test increases in patients with a high viral load, corresponding to a Ct 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context of active circulation of the virus and with a Positivity rate in RT-PCR of&#xD;
      about 5% in children, it was important for us to evaluate the performance of a rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic test by antigenic detection to optimize their management&#xD;
