  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are frequently associated with the acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS), which leads to a mortality of 30-40%. An altered type I interferon (IFN)&#xD;
      response has been demonstrated in patients with severe COVID-19, together with a high viral&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current work is, in a large cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted&#xD;
      in the ICU, to determine the prevalence of patients with positive anti-IFN antibodies and to&#xD;
      determine their outcome, as compared to patients having negative anti-IFN antibodies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are frequently associated with the acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS), which leads to a mortality of 30-40%. An altered type I interferon (IFN)&#xD;
      response has been demonstrated in patients with severe COVID-19, together with a high viral&#xD;
      load. A recent study revealed that 10% of patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      for severe COVID-19 had positive type I anti-IFN antibodies. Such finding has potentially&#xD;
      important therapeutic implications, as patients having positive anti-IFN antibodies could&#xD;
      benefit from targeted interventions, including plasmapheresis. The aim of the current work&#xD;
      is, in a large cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted in the ICU, to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of patients with positive anti-IFN antibodies and to determine their outcome, as&#xD;
      compared to patients having negative anti-IFN antibodies.&#xD;
