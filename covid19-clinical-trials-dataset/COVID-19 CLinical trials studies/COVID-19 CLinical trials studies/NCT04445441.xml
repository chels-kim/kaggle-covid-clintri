  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to evaluate the effectiveness of the combinations&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin (HCQ-AZ) and Chloroquine + Azithromycin (CQ-AZ) in the&#xD;
      treatment of Coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in Burkina Faso.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who received one of the two combinations will be included in the study and&#xD;
      followed-up until the patient is discharged from the hospital. They will be seen daily during&#xD;
      the period of their active clinical follow-up at the hospital. At each visit, the medical&#xD;
      history since the last visit (including treatments taken), signs and symptoms in progress if&#xD;
      any, will be collected. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected on Day 0, 3, 7 and 14 and&#xD;
      then on day 21 if he is still positive in order to assess the evolution of the viral load.&#xD;
      However if until the end of the follow-up on D21 the test is still positive, the sampling&#xD;
      will be continued until the patient become negative as recommended by the national standard&#xD;
      of care for the Covid patients management in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of safety, an ECG will be performed on day 0 prior to the treatment administration&#xD;
      and this will be repeated on day 7 and day 14 and every week until it normalizes or the&#xD;
      patient will be recommended to see a cardiologist to check the normalization of his ECG after&#xD;
      discharge from hospital. Adverse events will be recorded including biological parameters&#xD;
      (biochemistry and hematology) will be monitored, as well as changes in relevant laboratory&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
