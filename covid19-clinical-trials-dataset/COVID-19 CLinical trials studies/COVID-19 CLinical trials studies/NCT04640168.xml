  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTT-4 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to dexamethasone&#xD;
      and remdesivir. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For&#xD;
      discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, plasma (Day 29), and serum for secondary&#xD;
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, if infection control or other&#xD;
      restrictions limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic, these visits may be&#xD;
      conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have&#xD;
      laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir versus dexamethasone +&#xD;
      remdesivir as assessed by the mechanical ventilation free survival by Day 29.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an adaptive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100&#xD;
      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a&#xD;
      control arm. New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs.&#xD;
      There will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety.&#xD;
      If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for&#xD;
      comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an&#xD;
      updated sample size. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different&#xD;
      therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The&#xD;
      platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and&#xD;
      safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced. One independent Data&#xD;
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data in all stages to make&#xD;
      recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTT-4 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to dexamethasone&#xD;
      and remdesivir. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For&#xD;
      discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, plasma (Day 29), and serum for secondary&#xD;
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, if infection control or other&#xD;
      restrictions limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic, these visits may be&#xD;
      conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have&#xD;
      laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs&#xD;
      will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).&#xD;
      OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and&#xD;
      29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir versus&#xD;
      dexamethasone + remdesivir as assessed by the mechanical ventilation free survival by Day 29.&#xD;
      The key secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir&#xD;
      versus dexamethasone + remdesivir according to clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at Day&#xD;
      15.&#xD;
