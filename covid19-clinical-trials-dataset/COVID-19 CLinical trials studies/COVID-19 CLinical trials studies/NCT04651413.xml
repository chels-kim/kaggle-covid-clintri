  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study. The study will use high quality, reliable data&#xD;
      that has already been collected for the ISARIC 4C COVID-19 study in order to analyse the&#xD;
      relation between predictor variables (laboratory polymerase chain reaction [PCR] cycle&#xD;
      threshold [Ct] values) and outcomes for COVID-19 disease within a hospitalised population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, in the United Kingdom, the recommended method for diagnostic testing and screening&#xD;
      for COVID-19 is quantitative (real-time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) analysis of viral RNA extracted from upper respiratory tract samples. A positive result&#xD;
      indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of less&#xD;
      than 38 cycles of amplification (n.b. this is a locally agreed value, which is based on&#xD;
      analysis of proficiency testing performance and other local testing data. Cycle threshold&#xD;
      (Ct) values inversely correlate to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample. Thus, a&#xD;
      lower cycle threshold (Ct) value indicates a greater amount of target nucleic acid in a&#xD;
      sample i.e. a higher viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent scoping literature review has revealed only a handful of published studies to date&#xD;
      that explore an association between cycle threshold (Ct) values and disease severity or&#xD;
      clinical outcome in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The majority of these&#xD;
      studies have been conducted in China with small patient sample sizes. Thus, a larger-scale&#xD;
      study which explores the relationship between viral load and disease severity is required;&#xD;
      indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently highlighted this as an area which&#xD;
      needs further research.&#xD;
