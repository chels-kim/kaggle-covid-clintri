      Observational and prospective study with one year of follow-up of the cohort of workers of&#xD;
      the CSdM, including workers of subcontracted companies working in the Hospital of Mataró&#xD;
      (2,300 workers approximately) and with controls at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. All&#xD;
      CSdM workers will be invited to participate by e-mail and by announcements in the corporate&#xD;
      website. A space will be set up on the corporate intranet where workers will be informed&#xD;
      about the study, will be able to give their informed consent and will be able to answer an&#xD;
      electronic questionnaire regarding socio-demographic, clinical and labour personal&#xD;
      characteristics. Once the questionnaire answered, participants will be authorized to schedule&#xD;
      a blood extraction. Prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will be analyzed (IgA, IgM,&#xD;
      IgG). PCR will be also performed for IgM and IgA positive subjects.&#xD;

      -  Study design: observational and prospective study with one year of follow-up of the&#xD;
           cohort of workers of the CSdM, including workers of subcontracted companies working in&#xD;
           the Hospital of Mataró (2,300 workers approximately) and with controls at baseline and&#xD;
           at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aims: to perform a universal test for all the professionals of the Consorci Sanitari del&#xD;
           Maresme (CSdM) in order to carry out the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Let them know if they have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Identify asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Develop an immune map of all the professionals to: a) describe the seroprevalence&#xD;
                of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and their evolution over a year; b) help minimize the risk&#xD;
                of infection in CSdM professionals; c) contribute to the improvement of knowledge&#xD;
                about the infection and the social and occupational factors that affect its spread;&#xD;
                and d) allow in the future to identify the duration of immunity against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time Frame: 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: all workers from the healthcare centers of the Consorci Sanitari del&#xD;
           Maresme will be invited to participate by e-mail and by announcements in the corporate&#xD;
           website. A space will be set up on the corporate intranet where workers will be informed&#xD;
           about the study, will be able to give their informed consent and will be able to answer&#xD;
           an electronic questionnaire regarding socio-demographic, clinical and labour personal&#xD;
           characteristics. Once the questionnaire answered, participants will be authorized to&#xD;
           schedule a blood extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods: Prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will be analyzed (IgA, IgM, IgG)&#xD;
           and PCR will be also performed for IgM and IgA positive subjects following this&#xD;
           algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening the entire population with total CLIA result (IgA, IgM, IgG) to determine&#xD;
           negatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ELISA for positives with differentiated IgM, IgA and IgG results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PCR of nasopharyngeal smears on all IgM and IgA + (to determine asymptomatic cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be other blood samplings and determination points at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for all&#xD;
      the study participants.&#xD;
