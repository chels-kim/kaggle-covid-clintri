      Descriptive prospective study to investigate the prevalence of COVID 19 during ambulant&#xD;
      screening&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exact prevalence of COVID-19 is unknown. Due to the relatively high number of diagnosed,&#xD;
      symptomatic infections despite a strict policy, we expect a high prevalence of COVID 19&#xD;
      throughout the entire population. The risk that an asymptomatic carrier who is admitted to&#xD;
      the hospital for a (semi)urgent surgery, treatment of investigation transfers the virus to&#xD;
      the hospital staff is very high, and vice versa. This risk is even higher during surgery,&#xD;
      where intubation is necessary. Therefore we would like to pre-screen all patients ambulantly&#xD;
      on the presence of COVID 19 since there is no consensus for screening at the moment. The&#xD;
      golden standard is the SARS CoV-2 PCR on the nasopharyngeal sample together with a CT scan of&#xD;
      the lungs. Patients in which a bloodsample is taken as standard of care procedure in this&#xD;
      ambulant screening will be asked to give more blood for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On top of this standard of care screening, we will perform a questionnaire at the&#xD;
      pre-operative visit which evaluates the possible occurence of certain symptoms in the last 2&#xD;
      weeks. These symptoms are fever, anorexia, cough, diarrhea, sneezing, vomiting, dyspnea,&#xD;
      headache, rhinorrhea, loss of smell, muscle pain, sputum, sore throat and fatigue. Patients&#xD;
      were also asked if one of their housemates are affected by these symptoms. Furthermore, 2&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, patient will be contacted to phone in order to fill the same&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
