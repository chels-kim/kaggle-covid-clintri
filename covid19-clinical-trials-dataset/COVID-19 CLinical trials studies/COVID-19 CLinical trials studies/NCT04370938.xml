  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in the Hubei province of China in&#xD;
      December 2019, the US has become an epicenter for the pandemic, accounting for more than&#xD;
      220,000 cases and 4,800 deaths (CDC). The rapid spread of the associated disease, COVID-19,&#xD;
      has overwhelmed healthcare systems in spite of unprecedented measures to reduce contagion.&#xD;
      The resulting uncertainty with regard to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and&#xD;
      limited availability of resources and treatment have been detrimental to the mental health of&#xD;
      frontline healthcare providers (NIH). Preserving the psychological wellbeing of these&#xD;
      individuals is paramount to mitigating the effect of COVID-19 and delivering optimal patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particularly grave concern is how professional and personal distress caused by the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic will affect provider burnout (Lai et al. JAMA Network Open 2020).&#xD;
      Professional burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, career de-prioritization, and&#xD;
      loss of self-efficacy, represents a significant threat to the US healthcare system (Shanafelt&#xD;
      et al. Ann Surg 2010; Han et al. Annals of Internal Medicine 2019). While burnout has been&#xD;
      described as a reaction to chronic work-related stress (Melamed et al. Psychol. Bull. 2006),&#xD;
      individual factors such as anxiety increase susceptibility to burnout (Sun et al. J Occup&#xD;
      Health 2012). Although data suggests that occupational stress might amplify risk of anxiety&#xD;
      (DiGiacomo and Adamson J Allied Health 2001), we have yet to understand how intensified&#xD;
      anxiety among frontline providers during global health crises contributes to burnout.&#xD;
      Similarly, it is unknown whether factors such as perceived organizational support (POS), a&#xD;
      key driver of job satisfaction and performance (Muse and Stamper, J Managerial Issues 2007),&#xD;
      modify anxiety and burnout under these circumstances. We hypothesize that diminished POS in&#xD;
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with burnout and that this relationship is&#xD;
      mediated by an increase in providers' anxiety. Delineating this relationship is a critical&#xD;
      first step in developing interventions that ease the mental health burden of this pandemic&#xD;
      and future crises for healthcare providers.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A longitudinal survey-based research study investigating the domains of perceived organizational support, anxiety, and burnout will take place. Healthcare providers with patient-care contact will be asked to fill out these surveys once every 30 days over a period of 6 months. After the first survey is complete, 20% of participants will be randomized to watch a 1-hour long video discussing coping strategies for stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</intervention_model_description>
