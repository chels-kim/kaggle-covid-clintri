  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a theoretical risk that the nasal mucosal dryness caused by oral retinoid&#xD;
      medications may increase the risk of patients becoming infected with Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin is a drug used commonly in dermatology, usually for management of acne and&#xD;
      occasionally for management of other dermatological diseases. The most common side effect of&#xD;
      oral isotretinoin is mucocutaneous dryness, which can lead to nasal dryness and crusting.&#xD;
      Isotretinoin is derived from vitamin A and produces this side effect by arresting the cell&#xD;
      cycle of mucus secreting cells in the nasal cavity. The mucus usually secreted moisturises&#xD;
      the nasal cavity and provides a protective, lubricating layer overlying the cilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cilia and nasal mucous are both believed to have roles in defence against infection and&#xD;
      immunity. Hence it was postulated at the start of the pandemic that the effect this&#xD;
      medication has on the nasal environment may increase the likelihood of contracting a disease&#xD;
      spread by droplet or aerosol particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2020 we established a departmental Excel database of our patients on oral retinoid&#xD;
      medications in order to track those currently receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database includes people taking isotretinoin, alitretinoin and acitretin. The greatest&#xD;
      number of patients in this database are in the isotretinoin group and patients taking&#xD;
      isotretinoin tend to be a relatively young and fit population. Acitretin on the other hand is&#xD;
      often used in an older population who may have other underlying disease comorbidities. There&#xD;
      were only a very small number of patients taking alitretinoin in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to limit confounding variables and provide as clear a result as possible, it was&#xD;
      decided to limit this study to comparing the group of patients taking isotretinoin, aged&#xD;
      16-40years, with an age-matched background population from NHS Grampian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would examine the electronic patient record of patients aged 16-40years, taking&#xD;
      isotretinoin between March and October 2020 and compare their rates of Covid-19 infection,&#xD;
      hospitalisation and complications with the rates of the local age-matched background&#xD;
      population. Persons taking isotretinoin in the time period would be excluded from the&#xD;
      background population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Covid-19 is a new disease, the existing research literature on this specific topic is&#xD;
      extremely limited, and so far this study would be the first in this area.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The electronic patient record of patients aged 16-40years taking isotretinoin between March&#xD;
      and October 2020 will be accessed and the following will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Covid-19 testing while on or within 4 weeks after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive Covid-19 test while on or within 4 weeks after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalisation with Covid-19 while on or within 4 weeks after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU admission while on or within 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death directly attributed to Covid-19 while on or within 4 weeks of treatment. The data&#xD;
           held in the database is identifiable and held on the NHS Grampian secure server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the details above are filled in each case will be anonymised with a case number. A key&#xD;
      linking this back to the CHI will be kept on the NHS Grampian secure server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further data analysis will be completed using the anonymised data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of an age matched local population can be obtained from Health Intelligence pending&#xD;
      R&amp;D approval of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Aberdeen department of medical statistics have already been consulted about&#xD;
      this project and are willing to offer their help with data analysis. Once statistical&#xD;
      analysis has been decided upon we will update the protocol or submit the details as an&#xD;
      amendment, before analysis takes place.&#xD;

        This is an estimate based on the number of patients taking isotretinoin aged 16-40 we have&#xD;
        in the departmental database. We would try and obtain equal numbers in the isotretinoin and&#xD;
        background populations as far as possible, roughly 125 patients who received isotretinoin&#xD;
        and 125 background patients who did not. The numbers in each population can only be finally&#xD;
        determined when the database is interrogated and details are obtained from Health&#xD;
        Intelligence, neither of which can happen prior to approvals&#xD;
