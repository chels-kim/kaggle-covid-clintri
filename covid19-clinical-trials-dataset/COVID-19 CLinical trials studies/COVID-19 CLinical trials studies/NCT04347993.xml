    <textblock>
      The Hackensack Meridian Health Universal Observational COVID-19, a descriptive observational&#xD;
      database, is a multi-center initiative collecting data throughout the Hackensack Meridian&#xD;
      Health Network (HMH). HMH utilizes the EPIC system at most of the facilities, which will&#xD;
      serve as the primary data source. The database will be designed within the REDCap system. A&#xD;
      de-identified dataset will be sent to COTA for primary statistical analysis as requested by&#xD;
      the research teams.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle objective of this observational database is to build research-grade real world&#xD;
      data that will serve as platform to advance the scientific understanding and clinical care of&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Demographic, diagnostic, treatment and outcome data from centers throughout the Hackensack&#xD;
      Meridian Health Network will be abstracted from the electronic health records of patients&#xD;
      with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This will be purely observational and no direction as&#xD;
      to the care of the patient will be performed as part of this effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Data points to be collected will include, but are not limited to: age, gender, zip code,&#xD;
      prior evaluation for COVID-19, tobacco history, race, site of care, healthcare worker,&#xD;
      nursing home care, visits to ER, presenting features of fever/ cough/ dyspnea/&#xD;
      gastrointestinal/ mental status changes, days of symptoms, comorbidities, uses of&#xD;
      antihypertensives, duration of hospitalization/ icu care, presenting laboratory functions,&#xD;
      presenting vital signs, need for oxygen support, dialysis/ ecmo use, treatment with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine/ azithromycin/ remdesevir/ tociluzimab/ anti-inflammatory agents,&#xD;
      arrhythmias/ QTc prolongation, enrollment on clinical trial, positive cultures, survival and&#xD;
      cause of death. Additional data points will be added as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The data will be entered into a central &quot;Universal&quot; database hosted within the REDCap&#xD;
      system (HIPAA compliant, secure, access only per HMH research approval)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. A de-identified dataset will be sent to COTA for primary statistical analysis as requested&#xD;
      by the research teams. COTA will also make available a data/analytic visualization tool&#xD;
      (hosted on Tableau) for analysis by primary investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Additional data points and analysis may be added to the Universal database as requested by&#xD;
      HMH investigators with IRB approval. De-identified data may also be sent directly to HMH&#xD;
      investigators for their own analysis with IRB approval of their projects 5. Data will be made&#xD;
      available to governmental agencies as requested.&#xD;
