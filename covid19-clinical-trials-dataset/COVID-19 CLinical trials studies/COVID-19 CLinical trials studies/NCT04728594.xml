  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this evaluation, two versions of emails will be sent to Geisinger employees who have not&#xD;
      been vaccinated against COVID-19. A delayed-contact control group will be emailed after a&#xD;
      delay of at least two days. The researchers hypothesize that either of the emails - which use&#xD;
      content informed by behavioral nudge theory - will lead to more COVID-19 vaccinations than&#xD;
      the delayed-contact control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The researchers aim to evaluate the effectiveness of email reminders in promoting COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccinations among Geisinger employees. The project will compare two emails, which will vary&#xD;
      in the subject line and email content. Both emails will test different approaches that draw&#xD;
      from principles in behavioral science: social proof, reframing, and scarcity. Employees&#xD;
      receiving these emails will be compared with employees in a delayed-contact group, who will&#xD;
      not receive emails. Employees in the control group will later receive one of the emails.The&#xD;
      responses to the emails will help determine the communications later sent to the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All emails will ask recipients if they want to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. If they click&#xD;
      on a hyperlink indicating yes, they will be forwarded to an online registration and&#xD;
      scheduling homepage. If they click on a hyperlink indicating no, they will be forwarded to an&#xD;
      online questionnaire surveying people about their main reason for declining the vaccine at&#xD;
      this time. The questionnaire will automatically present information intended to assuage the&#xD;
      specific concern that people endorse, followed by a hyperlink to the scheduling site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed with logistic regression models with the control group as the&#xD;
      reference group, to compare the two email conditions versus the control group. This set of&#xD;
      analyses will only be conducted for scheduling a vaccination appointment as opposed to email&#xD;
      engagement outcomes (e.g., number of emails opened), which will not be applicable for the&#xD;
      control group. A second set of logistic regression models predicting scheduling a vaccination&#xD;
      appointment and email engagement will also be run, comparing the two email conditions against&#xD;
      each other. The data will be examined two days later (to help decide which email to send to&#xD;
      the delayed-control group) and four days later (when the policy for employee vaccination will&#xD;
      change, making the content of the email irrelevant).&#xD;

    <description>This group will receive an email that points out that vaccine availability for employees will soon be limited. It also addresses concerns about the side effects and adverse reactions of the vaccine. Due to potentially overblown concerns about the vaccine caused by the salience of side effects in the (social) media, the email attempts to reframe the risks by explicitly noting the small possibility of being affected by serious side effects and by contrasting that to the more severe effects of COVID-19. As a result of this reframing, recipients might recalibrate their perception of risks and benefits and opt for vaccination.</description>
