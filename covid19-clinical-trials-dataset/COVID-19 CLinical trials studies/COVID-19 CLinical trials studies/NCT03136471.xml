  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to use a natural experiment design to examine the impacts of the new&#xD;
      CPT code (99490) for chronic care management on health outcomes. The Investigators will&#xD;
      collaborate with partners in the Louisiana Clinical Data Research Network (LaCDRN) who serve&#xD;
      more than 90,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Louisiana to examine impacts of&#xD;
      the CMS reimbursed care coordination. Now, LaCDRN is renamed as Research Action for Health&#xD;
      Network (REACHnet). Patient and stakeholder engagement will be planned and implemented across&#xD;
      all phases of this natural experiment. This project will examine outcome differences created&#xD;
      by the policy change in a natural experiment framework. The analyses will utilize the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework to identify the critical elements of the programs that will enhance the reach,&#xD;
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of these strategies in the diverse&#xD;
      LaCDRN diabetes populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCORI Proposal COVID-19- Related Enhancement for Existing Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed enhancement will contribute timely information to address two important&#xD;
      implications of the coronavirus pandemic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disparities in continuity of care and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health systems' responsiveness in terms of telehealth delivery for high risk&#xD;
           populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enhancement builds upon our current project by further examining effects of CMS payment&#xD;
      innovations to expand remotely delivered care. Our proposed study is a rapid assessment of&#xD;
      telehealth services, using an existing &quot;learning health system&quot; infrastructure to provide&#xD;
      timely, actionable evidence to inform telehealth service provision during the pandemic and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first aim is to evaluate the barriers and facilitators for the RE-AIM dimensions as&#xD;
      related to the new CMS chronic care management code overall and within each of the health&#xD;
      systems. The qualitative study will be used. Focus group interview will be conducted among&#xD;
      patients, healthcare professionals and stakeholders. A variety of qualitative techniques will&#xD;
      be used to collect data using key informant interviews among organization leaders of LaCDRN&#xD;
      partners to assess the organizational cultures, their social architecture, resources,&#xD;
      capacity, and communication networks. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews will be used to&#xD;
      explore these domains, assess barriers, and refine the data collection for the assessing the&#xD;
      RE-AIM framework. Further, semi-structured interviews will provide data to inform the&#xD;
      refinement of study outcomes and ensure organizational, cultural, and health-literacy&#xD;
      appropriateness. Focus groups will be audiotaped with the written consent of each&#xD;
      participant, and each tape will be transcribed verbatim and transcripts will be reviewed and&#xD;
      edited by the facilitators for accuracy. Inter-coder reliability will be examined. Interview&#xD;
      transcripts will be imported into NVivo 10 software (QSR International, Burlington, MA).&#xD;
      Codes and concepts identified in preliminary review will be refined, extended, and&#xD;
      cross-referenced. Coded texts will be structured into taxonomies and transformed into a&#xD;
      matrix format so that responses and concepts can be compared across respondent groups.&#xD;
      Finally, taxonomies and matrices will be summarized by similarities and contrasts to form&#xD;
      overarching themes and dimensions. We will use an iterative technique until theoretical&#xD;
      saturation, the point at which no additional major themes emerge, is reached. Diabetes care&#xD;
      coordination readiness assessment will be conducted with LaCDRN partner health system's&#xD;
      medical directors (organizational).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second one is the health and economic impacts of the NFFCCM to improve health outcomes:&#xD;
      glycemic control, CVD risk reduction, medication adherence, patient-reported outcomes (PRO),&#xD;
      and health care utilization. Data extraction from the REACHnet. De-identified data from EMR&#xD;
      includes birth year, gender, race, state of residency, zip-codes, medical history, lab&#xD;
      results and prescriptions. All data comply with the Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act (HIPAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed research is significant because it is the first natural experiment to test an&#xD;
      ongoing CMS reimbursement policy on diabetes care in Louisiana. The study questions and study&#xD;
      outcomes will be patient-centered, and will generate urgently needed data on effective,&#xD;
      practical, and sustainable population-targeted strategies aimed at reducing diabetes-related&#xD;
      disease burden in Medicare-eligible populations. Further dissemination and scale-up efforts&#xD;
      will create large return on multiple health systems and non-CMS populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCORI Proposal COVID-19- Related Enhancement for Existing Research Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim1: Examine facilitators and barriers to uptake, adoption, and implementation of telehealth&#xD;
      services among Medicare patients with diabetes from health systems', providers' and patients'&#xD;
      perspectives. With the substantial increase in telehealth encounters starting in early March&#xD;
      2020, we hypothesize disparities in adoption and implementation of telehealth at health&#xD;
      system, provider and patient levels. For example, our current project has identified&#xD;
      significant variations in NFFCCM implementation across three health systems in Louisiana. For&#xD;
      the enhancement, we intend to examine variations in health systems' implementation of&#xD;
      Medicare-reimbursable telehealth services, which may not mirror the variations we observed&#xD;
      for NFFCCM given the dramatically different context of the current pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare diabetes control and continuity of care between patients with and without&#xD;
      utilization of telehealth. We hypothesize better diabetes management among Medicare patients&#xD;
      with telehealth versus without.&#xD;
