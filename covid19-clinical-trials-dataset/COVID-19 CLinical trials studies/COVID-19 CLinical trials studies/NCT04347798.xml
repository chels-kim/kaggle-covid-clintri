      This study aims to evaluate the experience of Alberta patients with inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      who participate in the the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      specifically comparing the experience of those taking anti-malarial medications compared to&#xD;
      those who do not. This registry includes approximately 2500 northern Alberta patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis who receive highly complex therapies which may be associated with side&#xD;
      effects. This program of data collection and research has been evaluating the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety as well as associated health care costs of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis&#xD;
      patients since 2004. The principle investigators are based at the University of Alberta while&#xD;
      the co-investigators are academic rheumatologists at the University of Alberta. The registry&#xD;
      has approximately 900 patients taking anti-malarials combined with their complex therapies&#xD;
      and ~ 1500 not on anti-malarials in combination with their complex therapies. We aim to&#xD;
      perform a case control study evaluating the impact of anti-malarial drugs (eg.&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) on the development of COVID-19 compared to those patients&#xD;
      who are not on anti-malarial drugs over the next 6-12 months. In addition to frequent e-mail&#xD;
      surveys screening for the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and understanding their concomitant&#xD;
      arthritis medication use, we will compare the healthcare outcomes of both groups of arthritis&#xD;
      patients with and without COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic. This information will&#xD;
      provide critical information beyond an anecdotal level on whether or not anti-malarials truly&#xD;
      provide a protective benefit against COVID-19 or reduce the severity of infection. A blood&#xD;
      sample from all participants (Covid-19 positive and negative) will be drawn approximately six&#xD;
      months into the study for measurement of antibodies to Covid-19 and possible blood types and&#xD;
      HLA alleles. Additionally, this study will be linked to another study &quot;Persistence of&#xD;
      SARS-Cov2 in immunocompromised patients&quot; which will specifically evaluate COVID-19 serology&#xD;
      and nasopharyngeal swab findings in the subset of patients who develop COVID-19.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of anti-malarial medications (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine)&#xD;
           on the development and severity of COVID-19 infection during the current COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic in an inception cohort registry of northern Alberta rheumatoid and psoriatic&#xD;
           arthritis patients who are on complex biologic therapies for the duration of the&#xD;
           pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To further evaluate the impact of all biologic medications currently in the registry on&#xD;
           the development and severity of COVID-19 by mechanism of action (eg. TNF antagonism vs&#xD;
           IL-6 blockade, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the &quot;case&quot; group of patients on concomitant anti-malarial&#xD;
      treatment with their biologic agent will have a lower incidence and severity of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection compared to those not on anti-malarials based on anecdotal reports of efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-malarials on COVID-19 infection from international reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced unforeseen challenges internationally and&#xD;
      led to great uncertainty for patients who are immunocompromised, such as patients in the&#xD;
      RAPPORT registry. Recent anecdotal reports from other countries have been associated with&#xD;
      media and political escalation of the potential benefit of anti-malarial drugs on the course&#xD;
      of COVID-19 infection. This has led to threats to the supply of anti-malarials drugs for&#xD;
      patients with rheumatic diseases like lupus and rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, where the&#xD;
      benefits are proven. The RAPPORT inception cohort registry provides a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in an immunocompromised population, while also evaluating the&#xD;
      potential impact of possible treatments for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of anti-malarial medications (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine)&#xD;
           on the development and severity of COVID-19 infection during the current COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic in an inception cohort registry of northern Alberta rheumatoid and psoriatic&#xD;
           arthritis patients who are on complex biologic therapies for the duration of the&#xD;
           pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To further evaluate the impact of all biologic medications currently in the registry on&#xD;
           the development and severity of COVID-19 by mechanism of action (eg. TNF antagonism vs&#xD;
           IL-6 blockade, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 versus other infections over the remaining&#xD;
           duration of the pandemic in an immunocompromised population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the incidence of COVID-19 versus other infections over the remaining duration&#xD;
           of the pandemic in the proportion of patients from the RAPPORT registry who take&#xD;
           concomitant anti-malarials versus those patients that do NOT take anti-malarials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the impact of different mechanisms of action of biologic medications within&#xD;
           the RAPPORT registry, on the incidence of COVID-19 versus other infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD/PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this case control study, we have identified ~900 patients within the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC&#xD;
      registry who are taking concomitant anti-malarial medications with their biologic medication&#xD;
      compared to ~ 1500 patients who are NOT taking concomitant anti-malarial medications. The&#xD;
      current consent for the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry allows patients to be contacted for their&#xD;
      potential participation in future studies. Based on this consent, we aim to send a letter to&#xD;
      all existing RAPPORT patients inviting them to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This letter will be sent by email to those with an associated email address and by Canada&#xD;
      Post mail for those who do not. Similar to previous surveys we have conducted, the letter&#xD;
      will provide a synopsis of the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic and request for&#xD;
      the patient to consent to the following: (1) consent to receive email/letters with surveys of&#xD;
      their clinical status at week 0 (the first point of contact), week 2, then every 4 weeks&#xD;
      until the pandemic is over according to the World Health Organization or most appropriate&#xD;
      local declaration and (2) consent to allow the study team access to the patient's medical&#xD;
      health records (Connectcare/Netcare) for the duration of the pandemic to provide complete&#xD;
      information regarding any healthcare utilization, investigations and outcomes over time. The&#xD;
      act of consent will be obtained if the patient answers specifically that the study team can&#xD;
      access their records and by the act of completing the survey every time. We will collect a&#xD;
      blood sample when the pandemic is over from the consenting patients for consideration of&#xD;
      serology testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will screen for clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and concomitant status of their&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis and medication use. This information is linked by a unique identifier&#xD;
      with the RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry. The RAPPORT-ONTRAAC registry collects baseline, and at&#xD;
      least annual information including patient demographics, ethnicity, disease characteristics,&#xD;
      serologies, and patient-reported outcomes evaluating the impact of arthritis on their&#xD;
      activities of daily living. With the additional linkage to their electronic medical records,&#xD;
      we aim to identify the following: hospitalizations, and laboratory and diagnostic&#xD;
      investigations. Access to the entire cohort's electronic medical records will provide the&#xD;
      opportunity to capture patients who may not develop any symptoms consistent with COVID and/or&#xD;
      may not be keen to participate in ongoing surveys but may be impacted by COVID-19. The subset&#xD;
      of patients who develop COVID-19 will be contacted to participate in the associated study&#xD;
      (Persistence of SARS-CoV2 in immunocompromised patients; Dr. M. Osman) for more in-depth&#xD;
      serological evaluations and nasopharyngeal swabs. At the end of the study, we will collect a&#xD;
      blood sample as well to ensure that COVID-19 serological evaluations are completed on&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals who participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey, developed in collaboration with Infectious Disease experts (Drs. Sonpar, Swartz,&#xD;
      Shafran, Singh), will screen for currently recognized signs and symptoms of COVID-19.&#xD;
      Additionally, confirmation of current arthritis medication use including all disease&#xD;
      modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) as well as biologics will be captured. Surveys will&#xD;
      be completed on REDCAP through email link, provided directly on the email or as a hyperlink&#xD;
      that the patient can type in if they receive the survey by Canada Post. The REDCAP survey&#xD;
      will be developed and housed by EPICORE (Epidemiology and Research Coordinating Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the remainder of the pandemic, electronic medical record and NETCARE searches will be&#xD;
      conducted for all consenting patients with pre-specified outcomes and interim investigations&#xD;
      and/or procedures or hospitalizations in Alberta Health Services facilities. REDCAP survey&#xD;
      responses will be collated with these searches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS: A response rate of 40% is expected for this study. Descriptive data&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted to describe the population of inflammatory arthritis patients&#xD;
      divided between those who are currently taking an anti-malarial and those who are not. The&#xD;
      registry provides information including demographics (gender, age, ethnicity) and at least&#xD;
      annual disease activity status with validated disease activity scores which differentiate&#xD;
      between low disease activity state/remission and mild, moderate and severe disease activity.&#xD;
      Co-morbidities through the Charlson Comorbidity Index will be identified and compared between&#xD;
      groups. Survey results over the pandemic per patient will be analyzed. Electronic medical&#xD;
      records will be reviewed at least monthly for all consenting patients to identify and&#xD;
      quantify investigations, procedures and healthcare resources utilized during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With multivariate analyses, the impact of anti-malarial use on the development and severity&#xD;
      of COVID-19 will be evaluated between the two groups, adjusting for important confounders&#xD;
      including the following: co-morbidities (eg. cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes),&#xD;
      biologic mediations, steroid use and other DMARDs. Further stratification by biologic DMARD&#xD;
      might be conducted. Healthcare utilization between groups will be compared over time.&#xD;
      Quantification of antibodies to Covid-19 will be compared between the anti-malarial and&#xD;
      non-anti-malarial groups.&#xD;
