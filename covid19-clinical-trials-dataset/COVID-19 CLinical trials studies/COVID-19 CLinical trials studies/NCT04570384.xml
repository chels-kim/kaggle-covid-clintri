      Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase II Trial of Intravenous&#xD;
      L-Citrulline (Turnobi) to Delay and Potentially Prevent the Need for Invasive Mechanical&#xD;
      Ventilation for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in Patients with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2)&#xD;
      Illness. To evaluate safety and efficacy of a bolus loading dose and continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of L-Citrulline compared to placebo in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous L-citrulline (Turnobi) administration will safely restore the homeostasis of&#xD;
      nitric oxide synthase by increasing both plasma citrulline and arginine levels. Investigators&#xD;
      also reason that restoration of citrulline/arginine balance through citrulline administration&#xD;
      will safely re-establish homeostasis of NOS, lower oxidative stress, and reduce inflammation,&#xD;
      thereby delaying and potentially preventing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
      participants hospitalized with COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2). The body lives in a delicate&#xD;
      balance of homeostasis. The urea/NO cycle plays a critical role in maintaining redox&#xD;
      homeostasis and as such, also plays a role in regulating inflammation. The biochemical&#xD;
      relationships are complex and depend on inter-organ transfer, membrane transport, and&#xD;
      intracellular compartmentation. However, data above demonstrate that citrulline, arginine,&#xD;
      and NO are critical in maintaining this homeostasis through their regulation of NOS.&#xD;
      Inflammation, especially from infection, results in decreased activity of CPS1 and increased&#xD;
      activity of arginase, which decreases levels of both citrulline and arginine. These decreased&#xD;
      levels result in dysregulated and uncoupled NOS, which drives both overexuberant NO&#xD;
      production and formation of ROS. Both the NO production and ROS further exacerbate the&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade, resulting in other organ dysfunctions, including acute lung injury.&#xD;
      Both inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to be driving forces for the&#xD;
      development of ALI and regulated NOS function is vital to reducing both. Both plasma&#xD;
      citrulline and arginine are deficient in sepsis and levels are inversely associated with&#xD;
      development of ALI. Furthermore, citrulline replacement safely increases plasma levels of&#xD;
      both citrulline and arginine in healthy volunteers, BMT patients, adults with sepsis,&#xD;
      children with sickle cell disease, and children after congenital heart surgery. It seems&#xD;
      highly likely that citrulline therapy in the setting of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) induced acute&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory illness will safely increase citrulline and arginine levels and help&#xD;
      re-establish NOS homeostasis, resulting in NO production in compartments that are more&#xD;
      homeostatically appropriate so as to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and enhance&#xD;
      coupling of NOS to minimize superoxide production thus reducing free radical mediated ALI.&#xD;
