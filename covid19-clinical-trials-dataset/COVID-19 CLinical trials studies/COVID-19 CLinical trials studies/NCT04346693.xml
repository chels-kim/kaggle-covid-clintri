    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate an effectiveness of the drug Dalargin for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of severe pulmonary complications symptoms associated with severe&#xD;
      and critical coronavirus infection cases (SARS COVID19, expanded as Severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome CÐ¾rona Virus Disease 2019 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test drug that will be administered to patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dalargin, solution for inhalation administration,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dalargin, solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration.&#xD;

      Research objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the effectiveness of the drug Dalargin, a solution for inhalation, for the&#xD;
           prevention of severe pulmonary complications in patients with coronavirus infection&#xD;
           (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the effectiveness of the drug Dalargin, a solution for inhalation, for the&#xD;
           treatment of severe pulmonary complications in patients with coronavirus infection&#xD;
           (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the effectiveness of the drug Dalargin, a solution for intravenous and&#xD;
           intramuscular administration, for the prevention of severe pulmonary complications in&#xD;
           patients with coronavirus infection (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the effectiveness of the drug Dalargin, a solution for intravenous and&#xD;
           intramuscular administration, for the treatment of severe pulmonary complications in&#xD;
           patients with coronavirus infection (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of the drug Dalargin, a solution for&#xD;
           inhalation administration, for the prevention of severe pulmonary complications in&#xD;
           patients with coronavirus infection (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of the drug Dalargin, a solution for&#xD;
           inhalation administration, for the treatment of severe pulmonary complications in&#xD;
           patients with coronavirus infection (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of the drug Dalargin, a solution for&#xD;
           intravenous and intramuscular administration, for the prevention of severe pulmonary&#xD;
           complications in patients with coronavirus infection (SARS-COVID-19);&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of the drug Dalargin, a solution for&#xD;
           intravenous and intramuscular administration, for the treatment of severe pulmonary&#xD;
           complications in patients with coronavirus infection (SARS-COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission to a specialized hospital for all patients with suspected COVID-19 Polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR) is being conducted. Only patients with confirmed coronavirus infection&#xD;
      are included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an open, randomized clinical trial of the drug Dalargin efficacy for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of severe pulmonary complications symptoms in patients with coronavirus infection&#xD;
      (SARS-COVID-19)&#xD;
