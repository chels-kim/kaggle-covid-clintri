      The administration of low-dose lung irradiation produces anti-inflammatory effects that will&#xD;
      decrease the pulmonary inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will evaluate the efficacy of treatment with low-dose pulmonary&#xD;
      radiotherapy added to standard support therapy, in hospitalized patients with respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms due to COVID-19 pneumonia, who do not experience improvement with conventional&#xD;
      medical therapy and are not subsidiaries of ICU&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO has officially confirmed that: &quot;Currently, there is no specific pharmacological&#xD;
      available treatment for COVID-19&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond vital support, there are not currently treatment options for Coronavirus disease&#xD;
      (COVID-19) and related pneumonia, the infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pulmonary irradiation is an option for the treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia and could be available quickly and with a duration of about 15 minutes of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic irradiation therapy at very low doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) dates back to the 1920s and was&#xD;
      the only effective mean to treat certain infectious and inflammatory diseases prior to the&#xD;
      development of antimicrobial therapies in the 1940s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to replicate low-dose radiation therapy, just as it was used 80 years ago for&#xD;
      viral pneumonia with great success. It will be administered for a new disease, pneumonia&#xD;
      caused by COVID-19, for which there is no cure and many people are dying, mainly from severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome leading to very severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      refractory to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This therapy is expected to remedy acute respiratory syndrome by reducing inflammation, and&#xD;
      it also has a low risk of side effects and toxicities, given the low doses received, more&#xD;
      than one hundred times lower, compared to the usual radiotherapy used to tumor treatment.&#xD;
