      The RTB101-211 study is a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2a Study of&#xD;
      RTB101 as COVID-19 Post-Exposure Prophylaxis in Asymptomatic Adults Age ≥65 Years who: have&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 detected on a surveillance nasal or nasopharyngeal swab OR live in the same house&#xD;
      or apartment as someone who has laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The study is&#xD;
      designed to obtain study feasibility data for RTB101 in an unbiased fashion and will inform&#xD;
      the design of a subsequent pivotal trial.&#xD;
