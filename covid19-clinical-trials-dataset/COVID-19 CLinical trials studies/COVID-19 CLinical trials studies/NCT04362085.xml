  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coagulopathy of COVID-19 afflicts approximately 20% of patients with severe COVID-19 and is&#xD;
      associated with need for critical care and death. COVID-19 coagulopathy is characterized by&#xD;
      elevated D-dimer, an indicator of fibrin formation and clot lysis, and a mildly prolonged&#xD;
      prothrombin time, suggestive of coagulation consumption. To date, it seems that COVID-19&#xD;
      coagulopathy manifests with thromboembolism, thus anticoagulation may be of benefit. We&#xD;
      propose to conduct a parallel pragmatic multi-centre open-label randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to determine the effect of therapeutic anticoagulation compared to standard care in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients admitted for COVID-19 with an elevated D-dimer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2-arm, parallel, pragmatic, multi-centre, open-label randomized controlled trial to determine&#xD;
      the effect of therapeutic anticoagulation, with low molecular weight heparin or&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin (high dose nomogram), compared to standard care in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 and an elevated D-dimer on the composite outcome of intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) admission, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation or death at 28 days. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment regimens, receiving either therapeutic anticoagulation or standard care until&#xD;
      discharged from hospital, death or day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary composite outcome of ICU admission, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation,&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation, or all-cause death up to 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary outcomes between study arms up to day 28 include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All-cause death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Composite outcome of ICU admission or all-cause death&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or all-cause death&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Major bleeding as defined by the ISTH Scientific and Standardization Committee&#xD;
           (ISTH-SSC) recommendation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of participants who received red blood cell transfusion (≥1 unit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Number of participants with transfusion of platelets, frozen plasma, prothrombin complex&#xD;
           concentrate, cryoprecipitate and/or fibrinogen concentrate&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Renal replacement therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Number of hospital-free days alive&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Number of ICU-free days alive&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Number of ventilator-free days alive&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Number of organ support-free days alive&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Number of participants with venous thromboembolism&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Number of participants with arterial thromboembolism&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Number of participants with heparin induced thrombocytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Changes in D-dimer up to day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment arm is therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin (UFH, high dose nomogram). The choice of LMWH versus UFH will be at&#xD;
      the clinician's discretion. LMWH options include: Tinzaparin, Enoxaparin, or Dalteparin. UFH&#xD;
      will be administered using a weight-based nomogram with titration according to the&#xD;
      center-specific protocol. Therapeutic anticoagulation will be administered until discharged&#xD;
      from hospital, 28 days or death. If the patient is admitted to the ICU or requiring&#xD;
      ventilatory support, we recommend continuation of the allocated treatment as long as the&#xD;
      treating physician is in agreement. The standard care arm is the administration of LMWH, UFH&#xD;
      or fondaparinux at thromboprophylactic doses in the absence of contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study specific bloodwork will be ordered aside from a single D-dimer test (if not&#xD;
      collected through standard of care) up to and including day 3 after randomization for all&#xD;
      participants in both study arms. In those on the active treatment arm who are receiving UFH,&#xD;
      the aPTT or UFH anti-Xa will be drawn according to local institutional UFH nomogram protocol&#xD;
      guidance. All laboratory results will be collected from standard of care from admission to&#xD;
      hospital discharge, death or 28 days, where available. An optional biobanking component will&#xD;
      collect blood at baseline and 2 follow up time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will immediately impact the clinical care of patients with severe COVID-19&#xD;
      internationally, whether the findings are positive or negative, as COVID-19 coagulopathy is a&#xD;
      highly prevalent complication of severe COVID-19 and may precede the respiratory&#xD;
      manifestations that characterize it.&#xD;
