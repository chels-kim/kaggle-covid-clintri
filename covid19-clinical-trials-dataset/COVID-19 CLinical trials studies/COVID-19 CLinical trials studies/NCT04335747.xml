      The trial is a prospective, observational study aiming to identify risk factors for serious&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection by evaluating clinical measures and biomarkers of inflammation in patients&#xD;
      with inflammatory rheumatic disease hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with control groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-19, has severely affected health care&#xD;
      systems around the world. In Denmark, more than 85,000 patients have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE), or giant cell arthritis, and many are treated with immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy including biologics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present it is unclear whether the best course of action during a viral pandemic is to&#xD;
      pause treatment with biologics, change to drugs with a different mode of action or continue&#xD;
      treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with RA and SLE receive hydroxychloroquine (HCL) treatment for their rheumatic&#xD;
      disease, but HCL has also been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aim to identify risk factors for serious COVID-19 infection by evaluating clinical&#xD;
      measures and biomarkers of inflammation, including IL6 and IL10 in patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      rheumatic disease hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with measures in control groups.&#xD;
