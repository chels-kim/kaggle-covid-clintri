      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a single dose of STI-1499 (COVI-GUARD™), a COVID-19&#xD;
      targeting monoclonal antibody, in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19. Four dose&#xD;
      levels will be tested: 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of moderate COVID-19, diagnosed standard RT-PCR assay or equivalent testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with study procedures and follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject or family member/caregiver must have provided written informed consent which&#xD;
             includes signing the institutional review board approved consent form prior to&#xD;
             participating in any study related activity. However, if obtaining written informed&#xD;
             consent is not possible, other procedures as provided in the March 27th, 2020 FDA&#xD;
             Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic,&#xD;
             Question 10, may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinical signs indicative of severe COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rapidly progressive COVID-19 which is likely to progress to &quot;severe&quot; within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented infection other than COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely impact&#xD;
             safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has participated, or is participating, in a clinical research study evaluating&#xD;
             COVID-19 convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, or&#xD;
             intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 3 months or less than 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit. Note:&#xD;
             Participants who have been prescribed hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or&#xD;
             without azithromycin or other approved products for the off-label treatment of&#xD;
             COVID-19 prior to study enrollment may be included and may continue to receive these&#xD;
             agents so long as the dose remains stable. Additionally, any approved or authorized&#xD;
             treatment (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone or treatments approved under an Emergency&#xD;
             Use Authorization) is allowed.&#xD;
