  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The infection&#xD;
      affects all age groups, although childhood is the lowest proportion of those affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main clinical manifestations that require hospitalization of infected patients are SARS&#xD;
      pneumonia, which may require treatment in the intensive care unit (27%) and its progression&#xD;
      into acute respiratory distress syndrome (67%) with life-threatening conditions in almost 25%&#xD;
      of patients diagnosed with &quot;SARS-CoV-2 infection&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nervous system damage with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been practically not investigated, but&#xD;
      neurological disorders have been reported in 36% of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the mortality rate associated with the new virus is high in patients who require&#xD;
      treatment in intensive care units (62% of cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we are conducting a prospective study to identify acute encephalopathy predictors&#xD;
      in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, cohort-based, adaptive design study that aims to identify acute&#xD;
      encephalopathy predictors in patients with COVID-19. Patients with community-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia and confirmed pulmonary tissue infiltration will be enrolled in the study based on&#xD;
      CT data with changes corresponding to the medium and high probability of coronavirus&#xD;
      pneumonia (CO-RADS 4-5) and lesion of at least 25% of one lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be examined at least twice (2 visits): P1 - on admission to hospital; P2 -&#xD;
      in 10Â±5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the further course of the disease patients will be divided into 2 groups (cohorts). Group&#xD;
      1 - patients who have developed acute encephalopathy. Group 2 - patients who at the moment of&#xD;
      discharge have no acute encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect clinical exam ( including neurological signs), neurophysiological data&#xD;
      (including electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential (EP)), comprehensive laboratory&#xD;
      tests, CT-scan and all standards of care to identify predictors of acute encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The pilot phase - inclusion of the first 60 patients, followed by an interim analysis on&#xD;
           the basis of which will be clarified:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sample size;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters to be analyzed;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  terms and frequency of the EEG and EP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The main phase - further patient recruitment and all procedures required by the&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intermediate and final analysis will include both patients who have developed acute&#xD;
      encephalopathy (main group) and patients who have not developed acute encephalopathy (control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute encephalopathy will be defined as recently stated :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The term acute encephalopathy refers to a rapidly developing (over less than 4 weeks,&#xD;
           but usually within hours to a few days) pathobiological process in the brain. This is a&#xD;
           preferred term&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute encephalopathy can lead to a clinical presentation of subsyndromal delirium,&#xD;
           delirium, or in case of a severely decreased level of consciousness, coma; all&#xD;
           representing a change from baseline cognitive status&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The term delirium refers to a clinical state characterized by a combination of features&#xD;
           defined by diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium according to the DSM-5 is defined if criterium A-E are fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift&#xD;
      attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days)&#xD;
      represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity&#xD;
      during the course of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language,&#xD;
      visuospatial ability, or perception).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. The disturbances in criteria A and C are not explained by another pre-existing,&#xD;
      established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder, and do not occur in the context of a&#xD;
      severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the&#xD;
      disturbance is a direct physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance&#xD;
      intoxication or withdrawal (i.e. because of a drug of abuse medication), or exposure to a&#xD;
      toxin, or is because of multiple etiologies [1].&#xD;
