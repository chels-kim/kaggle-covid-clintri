  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are implementing a policy of six-month dispensing of&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications for HIV. Under the new guidelines, stable patients can&#xD;
      receive a six-month supply of ARV medications at once, reducing the number of clinic visits&#xD;
      required for medication refills. South Africa is considering this policy but has not yet&#xD;
      adopted it and has requested evidence of its feasibility, effectiveness, and costs to the&#xD;
      healthcare system and to patients. The decision on whether to implement a six-month&#xD;
      dispensing policy has become urgent due to the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, as clinic visits to&#xD;
      refill prescriptions pose COVID-19 transmission risks to both patients and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate the required evidence, South Africa is implementing a pilot program that will&#xD;
      allow for a cluster-randomized evaluation of 6-month dispensing. This protocol is for that&#xD;
      evaluation. It aims to provide supporting evidence to inform future policy and procurement&#xD;
      decisions by the National Department of Health (NDOH). All interventions will be conducted as&#xD;
      part of routine care by Department of Health staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot program, the NDOH will randomize 28 clinics in two provinces 1:1 to receive the&#xD;
      six month dispensing intervention or continue standard of care, which currently allows for&#xD;
      2-3 month dispensing. The researchers will assess the patient outcomes of six month&#xD;
      dispensing, administer a cross-sectional patient questionnaire, conduct semi-structured&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with care providers and implementers, and estimate the costs to NDOH and&#xD;
      to patients of six month dispensing. A maximum of 150,545 patients will be followed through&#xD;
      their medical records and 400 patients and providers will be consented to be interviewed at&#xD;
      baseline and after 6 months (total maximum sample size = 150,945).&#xD;

      The overall aims of this study are to assess the uptake and impact of six-month medication&#xD;
      dispensing (6MMD) on HIV patients' treatment outcomes at public-sector clinics; estimate the&#xD;
      costs of the intervention; and assess patients' and providers' perspectives on 6MMD. All&#xD;
      implementation of the interventions and generation of data will be done by the National&#xD;
      Department of Health and its support partners; this study will evaluate the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the evaluation are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Among HIV infected patients on antiretroviral therapy who are newly eligible for&#xD;
      6MMD, assess the uptake of 6MMD among eligible patients, stratified by repeat prescription&#xD;
      refill strategy. Evaluation questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What proportion of patients is eligible for 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What proportion of eligible patients choose to enrol in 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What proportion of enrolled patients receive more than one consecutive 6-month refill?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Is six-month dispensing non-inferior to standard of care (two- or three-month&#xD;
      dispensing) in terms of retention in care and viral suppression? Evaluation questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of 6MMD on retention compared to standard of care for patients&#xD;
           eligible for 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of 6MMD on viral suppression within 6 and 12 months of intervention&#xD;
           enrollment (intervention patients) or eligibility (comparison patients), compared to&#xD;
           standard of care for patients eligible for 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of 6MMD on retention and suppression among all ART patients in a&#xD;
           clinic, regardless of whether they were eligible for or received 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Is 6MMD more or less acceptable to patients and providers than standard of care?&#xD;
      Evaluation questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors influence patient choice to enrol in 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To what extent does the risk of COVID-19 influence a patient's decision to enrol in&#xD;
           6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the barriers and facilitators to implementing 6MMD from the perspective of&#xD;
           providers?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How has COVID-19 impacted the implementation of 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has there been any task shifting as a result of the implementation of 6MMD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What was the level of fidelity to the standard operating procedures (SOP) for 6MMD&#xD;
           implementation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: What is the cost of 6MMD to providers and patients compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      Evaluation questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How often do 6MMD patients return to facilities for HIV or other health care or to&#xD;
           collect other chronic medications between scheduled ARV dispensing visits?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the average cost to the provider (DOH) per 6MMD patient and for all ART patients&#xD;
           at the study clinics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the patient cost of ART for those receiving 6MMD compared to standard of care?&#xD;
