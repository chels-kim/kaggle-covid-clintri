  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There were 83,85,440 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with a mortality rate of 5.4%&#xD;
      according to the situation report of the World Health Organisation on June 19, 2020. In India&#xD;
      there were 3,95,048 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a mortality rate of 3.3%. In Tamil Nadu&#xD;
      there were 54,449 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a mortality rate of 1.2% according to the&#xD;
      report of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India on June 19, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection is a double challenge for people with diabetes. India has a large number&#xD;
      of persons with diabetes (more than 77 million). Recent studies have reported rising&#xD;
      prevalence both in the urban and rural populations. The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D)&#xD;
      also shows an increasing trend in the last few decades. Mortality seems to be threefold&#xD;
      higher in people with diabetes when COVD-19 coexists when compared with mortality due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 without comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yang et al noted that among 52 intensive care patients who had COVID 19 infection, 22% had&#xD;
      diabetes among the non-survivors. In a study of 173 patients with severe disease, 16.2% had&#xD;
      diabetes, and in another study of 140 hospitalized patients, 12% had diabetes. Li et al&#xD;
      compared intensive care and non-intensive care patients who had COVID-19. They showed a&#xD;
      twofold increase in the incidence of diabetes in intensive care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to diabetes; the other common co-morbidities present in COVID 19 patients were&#xD;
      hypertension (20%), cardiovascular disease (16%), and lung disease (6%). In this context,&#xD;
      patients with diabetes have been listed as people with higher severity for COVID-19 by&#xD;
      several health authorities. However, precise data regarding patients with and without&#xD;
      diabetes having COVID-19 infection are still lacking. Moreover, the relationship between&#xD;
      diabetes and the severity of COVID-19 remains unknown. In this study, we intend to identify&#xD;
      the disease severity and mortality in people with and without diabetes admitted for COVID-19&#xD;
      in southern India.&#xD;

      The following data from a person tested positive for COVID 19 and hospitalized will be&#xD;
      collected. Patient's anthropometry (height in cms, weight in kgs and body mass index in&#xD;
      kg/m2), blood pressure, symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, fatigue, cough, cephalalgia, dyspnoea,&#xD;
      rhinitis, pharyngeal symptoms, ageusia, anosmia, digestive disorders), history of smoking,&#xD;
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy),&#xD;
      macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular&#xD;
      disease) complications and other co morbid conditions will be recorded. Fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose, HbA1c and any other relevant investigations if available and treatment for COVID-19&#xD;
      and other co morbid conditions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of patients developing new symptoms, shifted to ICU, intubated or died during the&#xD;
      course of treatment will be recorded. Appearance of any complication during the stay at&#xD;
      hospital will be recorded. The changes in the treatment pattern during the course of the&#xD;
      disease will also be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will be fully anonymised and statistician will have no access to patients'&#xD;
      personal identifiers. All &quot;investigators&quot; will have to register before entering data in the&#xD;
      registry. Data about clinical observations for the individual patient will be entered by&#xD;
      clinicians or by authorised research personnel of the care team in the web registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' name, date of birth, date of death, residential postal code, hospital number will&#xD;
      be fully anonymised at source. In no circumstances, patients' identifiable data be available&#xD;
      to anyone outside their own care teams or authorised local administration/research personnel.&#xD;
      Patient data will not at any stage will be in identifiable form by the registry managers. The&#xD;
      data to be collected from the patients are mentioned in the visit chart.&#xD;
