  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to advance the scientific understanding of how a prenatal&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress influences infant neurodevelopment.&#xD;
      This project will aim to shed light on how families and child development are impacted by the&#xD;
      current COVID-19 pandemic and will work to better support these families and children as they&#xD;
      grow.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal exposure to maternal illness and stress has been widely associated with adverse&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, including deficits in cognition and socioemotional development.&#xD;
      The principal goal of this project utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG), and a variety of behavioral measures to assess brain maturation&#xD;
      and neurodevelopment among infants exposed prenatally to COVID-19 and associated high levels&#xD;
      of stress. The planned experiments are effective in determining measures of stress response&#xD;
      in relation to a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and characterize the neurodevelopmental sequelae&#xD;
      of those infants born to mothers with a COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific goals include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the prevalence of psychological distress in pregnant women with a confirmed&#xD;
           COVID-19 diagnosis and to examine the extent to which existing high risk environments&#xD;
           play a role in the susceptibility of heightened psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of prenatal distress and maternal illness/inflammation related to&#xD;
           a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis on early structural and functional brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize neural networks that may have been impacted by a maternal COVID-19&#xD;
           infection and related stress during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the early neurodevelopment outcomes of infants exposed to elevated prenatal&#xD;
           stress and trauma related to a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis during pregnancy.&#xD;

The raw scores for each scale can be converted into age-adjusted normalized scores.</description>
