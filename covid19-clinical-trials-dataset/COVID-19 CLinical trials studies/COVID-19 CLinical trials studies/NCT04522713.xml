  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of a transdiagnostic course that is intended to work&#xD;
      for a large variety of patient groups with clinically significant depression or anxiety in&#xD;
      primary care. This is a prospective single-group study where 68 adults with clinically&#xD;
      significant symptoms of depression or general anxiety, and up to 25 adults with subclinical&#xD;
      symptoms, attend up to 6 weekly structured large-group course sessions which focus on&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies to reduce psychiatric symptoms and increase wellbeing. If&#xD;
      necessary, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the course will be held online.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and the common anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and associated with&#xD;
      disability and reduced quality of life. There is reason to believe that the majority of these&#xD;
      patients are found in primary care. Official Swedish guidelines dictate that primary care&#xD;
      clinics are responsible for treating mild to moderate cases, but access to treatment is&#xD;
      limited. Transdiagnostic psychological interventions have been found to be efficacious for&#xD;
      anxiety and mood disorders, and require a relatively rudimentary pre-treatment assessment. A&#xD;
      large-group transdiagnostic course based on cognitive-behavioral principles may constitute an&#xD;
      effective use of limited resources to improve access to treatment, and offer a sufficiently&#xD;
      effective intervention, for most primary care patients with mild to moderate mental health&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a large-group transdiagnostic&#xD;
      intervention for depression and clinically significant anxiety in Swedish primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single-group feasibility study where 68 adults with clinically&#xD;
      significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, and up to 25 adults with subclinical symptoms,&#xD;
      are offered 6 weekly structured transdiagnostic large-group course sessions which focus on&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies to reduce psychiatric symptoms and increase wellbeing. If&#xD;
      necessary, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the course will be held online. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include within-group effects on psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms (response rates), adherence rates, need for additional treatment, and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
