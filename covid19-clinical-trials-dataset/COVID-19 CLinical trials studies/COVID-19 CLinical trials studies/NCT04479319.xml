  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus which was first&#xD;
      identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Then the novel coronavirus outbreak was&#xD;
      described and announced as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the gold standard test&#xD;
      for diagnosis of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to its high false-negative rates (%10-50),&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment decisions do not depend on RT-PCR alone. Clinical presentation of&#xD;
      patient and radiological findings are also important. However, neither clinical presentation&#xD;
      nor computed tomography (CT) findings are specific for COVID-19. As a consequence of these&#xD;
      challenges, the diagnosis of the disease and the protection of the community health become&#xD;
      more difficult. The investigators of this study hypothesized that deep learning-based&#xD;
      decision support system may help for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. The aim is to develop&#xD;
      a deep learning-based decision support system algorithm based on clinical presentation of&#xD;
      patient, laboratory and CT findings and RT-PCR data. Previously, deep learning algorithms&#xD;
      with the use of widely known deep neural network architectures such as Inception, UNet,&#xD;
      ResNet were developed. However all of these studies were based on CT findings. There are not&#xD;
      any deep learning study in literature combining the clinical, radiological, and laboratory&#xD;
      findings of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is based on the available data of COVID-19 patients that will be obtained from&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health. Then the data will be evaluated for relevance and reliability and&#xD;
      labeled for the training of machine. Following the anonymization of data, data will be&#xD;
      processed according to the predetermined inclusion-exclusion criteria. Thorax CT data will be&#xD;
      labeled as typical / indeterminate / atypical / negative for COVID-19 pneumonia. Also, CT&#xD;
      images of patients with known non-COVID-19 diseases will be labeled for the training of&#xD;
      machine. Then, fever, lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, contact information,&#xD;
      RT-PCR findings will be labeled. Subsequently, the patients will be labeled and the machine&#xD;
      will be trained with deep learning method with the help of this grouped and labeled data.&#xD;
      Following the training phase, the algorithm will be tested and if the machine reaches the&#xD;
      target specificity and sensitivity, the prototype will be tested. And then, the prototype&#xD;
      will be embedded into the hospital software system. This software and algorithm will serve as&#xD;
      an early warning system for clinicians and provide a better diagnostic rate especially with&#xD;
      decreasing false-negative results. The effects of a pandemic cannot be measured by only the&#xD;
      number of people diagnosed and isolated, or treatment provided. A pandemic affects not only&#xD;
      community health but also individuals' psychological status, education, teaching methods,&#xD;
      working models, daily lifestyles, producer/consumer behaviors, supply/demand balance; in&#xD;
      other words every single area of life. On top of that, a pandemic causes long-term damages&#xD;
      hard to reverse. The software will increase the diagnostic success rates, help to control the&#xD;
      pandemic and minimize the collateral damages mentioned above. The investigators believe that,&#xD;
      the product that will be produced at the end of this project will be of great benefit in&#xD;
      controlling the secondary wave of COVID-19 expected to occur.&#xD;
