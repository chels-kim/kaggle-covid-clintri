  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 (corona virus) pandemic the research arena has had to rapidly adapt and&#xD;
      change in order to facilitate and deliver research. The UK (United Kingdom) government and&#xD;
      Public Health England have stressed the importance of such research to find solutions to&#xD;
      treating, preventing and stopping the spread of COVID-19. Due to national and international&#xD;
      'lock down restrictions' delivering research in care home settings has become even more&#xD;
      challenging. The adaptations to conducting consultations have relied heavily on the use of&#xD;
      technology, for example video calling, telephone, email, and teleconferencing. It is&#xD;
      suggested that the use of technology in care home settings is already a barrier to effective&#xD;
      research delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, as care home residents are a vulnerable group, it is critical to include these&#xD;
      groups in research in order to enable improved and evidence-based care and their access to&#xD;
      new and emerging treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the opinions and experiences of key stakeholders to identify&#xD;
      barriers, and enable better facilitation of research in these settings during and post&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

      This two phase project will use a mixed methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase one will involve mixed methods surveys. One will be completed by care home residents&#xD;
      and the other will be completed by research delivery staff and care home staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two will involve qualitative interviews with each of these groups to enable better&#xD;
      insight into their views and opinions on research in this area.&#xD;
