  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posing a serious challenge to the health-care&#xD;
      systems worldwide, with an enormous impact on health conditions and loss of lives. More than&#xD;
      30 millions of recoveries worldwide were registered at the end of October 2020 with more than&#xD;
      1 million of deaths. As the disease continues to spread, strategies aimed to reduce&#xD;
      hospitalization time in sub intensive unit care, thus reducing pressure on health system, but&#xD;
      also to reduce some of the pathological features of COVID-19 such as inflammation and the&#xD;
      &quot;cytokines storm&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carbohydrate, adequate-protein diet that promotes a&#xD;
      physiological ketosis (due to an increase of liver ketone bodies production). High fat, low&#xD;
      carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce duration of ventilator support and partial&#xD;
      pressure carbon dioxide in patients with acute respiratory failure. Moreover, the&#xD;
      physiological increase in plasma levels of ketone bodies exerts important anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      and immunomodulating effects, which may reveal as precious tools to reduce potential adverse&#xD;
      outcomes of COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the administration of a ketogenic diet will improve gas&#xD;
      exchange, reduce inflammation, and the duration of hospitalization. The plan is to enrol 28&#xD;
      patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized but not in ICU with SPO2 higher than 88%.&#xD;
