  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is relevant to public health because of the critical importance of&#xD;
      infant attachment and early experiences to the lifetime trajectory of mental health and&#xD;
      socio-emotional functioning. This Randomized Clinical Trial addresses major gaps in available&#xD;
      family-wide programs that can promote healthy development that best serve infants, mothers,&#xD;
      fathers, and inter-parental relationships in cost-effective ways. This study also&#xD;
      systematically tests for which families the interventions are most effective and rigorously&#xD;
      tests the theoretical processes that link changes in mother-infant, father-infant, and&#xD;
      mother-father interactions with infant and parent outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventative interventions involving video-feedback programs to promote parenting (VIPP) have&#xD;
      been shown to be successful in improving maternal sensitivity and infant-mother attachment&#xD;
      security. However, interventions might be substantially more effective if broader elements of&#xD;
      family systems were also addressed, including father-child and inter-parental relationships,&#xD;
      particularly given the growing body of evidence that highlights the importance of father&#xD;
      involvement and positive engagement in children's socio-emotional development. Infancy is a&#xD;
      particularly sensitive and vulnerable period not only for the child but also for the parents&#xD;
      who often experience heightened daily stress, parenting demands, work-family role strain, and&#xD;
      inter-parental discord associated with changes in the family.The proposed longitudinal study&#xD;
      addresses major gaps by testing the effectiveness of family-wide preventative interventions&#xD;
      designed to promote healthy development and functioning in infants, mothers, and fathers,&#xD;
      including low-income families. This three-phase study involves a rigorous randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (RCT) approach and will involve a demographically diverse sample of 400 families. Phase&#xD;
      I involves a lab and home pre-test (infants 6 months of age) and 8-week intervention period;&#xD;
      Phase II (12 months) includes an initial post-test, and Phase III (16-18 months) involves a&#xD;
      second post-test. Families will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: sensitivity&#xD;
      intervention (SI), couples intervention (CI), both (SI + CI) or control. Specific aims of the&#xD;
      study include: (1) An evaluation of the effectiveness of the SI, CI, and SI+CI interventions&#xD;
      at improving parental sensitivity, parental efficacy, parenting stress, inter-parental&#xD;
      conflict, infant affective development, attachment security, behavior problems, and&#xD;
      socio-emotional competence; (2) A test of the mechanisms through which change in behavior&#xD;
      occurs. For example, relations between SI participation in Phase I and child attachment in&#xD;
      Phase III may be mediated by enhanced parent sensitivity in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relations between CI participation and child outcomes may be mediated by inter-parental&#xD;
      functioning and more effective communication skills; (3) An examination of factors that&#xD;
      moderate the effectiveness of the interventions, determining which families benefit the most.&#xD;
      Potential moderators include demographic characteristics, family (dis)organization, parents'&#xD;
      own caregiving history, parents' depressive and anxious systems, and infant negative&#xD;
      temperament; (4) Mother-father comparisons on direct effects, mediating mechanisms and&#xD;
      moderating processes. This study builds upon past research towards increasing children's&#xD;
      emotional security in multiple family relationships by testing new directions in preventative&#xD;
      interventions in infancy, addressing the mother-child, father-child, and mother-father&#xD;
      relationships. The goal is to foster children's socio-emotional development and security&#xD;
      through cost-effective family-wide interventions in infancy that promote sensitive&#xD;
      parent-infant interactions and improved inter-parental communication.&#xD;

    <description>4 home visits take place. Mothers and fathers are video recorded with their infant (separately) for approximate 10-15 minutes at the beginning of each visit. The recorded situations are natural (e.g., playing together, bathing the baby, mealtime, etc.) and the family coach (interventionist) is not actively involved in the parent-child interaction. A different theme is covered across the four intervention sessions. For each parent-infant interaction recording, the family coach reviews the recordings between visits and provides feedback to parents in the following intervention session. The exception to this is that video of parent-child interactions during the lab pre-test is used for material at the first home visit. Each session takes approximately 90 minutes. Visits occur over an 8 week period with phone contacts between each session. Because of COVID-19, we now conduct remote visits using Zoom.</description>

    <description>The psycho-educational inter-parental conflict prevention curriculum is a 4-session program that takes place in the families' homes. Each session lasts approximately 90 minutes and involves discussion and practice of four themes pertinent to improving conflict process, communication, and emotional security in the family: Conflict Overview, Interparental Conflict and Children, Stresses of Parenting, and Emotional Security. The family coach scaffolds and supports the couples' development of constructive conflict behaviors. Visits occur over an 8 week period with phone contacts between each session. Because of COVID-19, we now conduct remote visits using Zoom.</description>
