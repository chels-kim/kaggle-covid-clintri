  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this adaptive trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of Ifenprodil in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients infected with COVID-19. This Protocol is largely based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint Clinical Trials Expert Group COVID-19 Therapeutic&#xD;
      Trial Synopsis, and associated Master Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the primary outcome measure will be determined by a pilot study of the first&#xD;
      150 subjects. Subject clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15 in treatment&#xD;
      versus the control group is the default primary endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NP-120 (Ifenprodil) is an N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NDMA) inhibitor that is specific for the NR2B&#xD;
      subunit of the NMDA Receptor. The NMDA receptor, and specifically the NR2B subunit, is&#xD;
      involved in glutamate signaling, and is expressed on both neutrophils and T cells. In the&#xD;
      case of neutrophils, activation of the NMDA receptor can (1) result in expression of CD11b&#xD;
      which targets neutrophils via ICAM-1 to areas of inflammation, and (2) trigger the autocrine&#xD;
      release of glutamate. In the case of T-cells, activation of T cells via glutamate can cause&#xD;
      (1) T cell proliferation and, (2) the release of cytokines. The activation of T cells and&#xD;
      cytokine release can be blocked in vitro by the addition of Ifenprodil. As such it could be a&#xD;
      potent anti-inflammatory agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ifenprodil was discovered by a genome wide RNAi assay to uncover gene targets associated with&#xD;
      cytoprotective activity against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza, specifically by preserving&#xD;
      cell viability in vitro. When tested in a murine model of H5N1, the drug at clinically&#xD;
      relevant doses: (1) improved survivability from 0% at day 6 to 40% day 14 post-infection, (2)&#xD;
      the drug significantly reduced edema and lung injury score and (3) reduced infiltrating T&#xD;
      cells, neutrophils and NK cells and attenuated the 'cytokine storm'. The mortality rate of&#xD;
      H5N1 in humans is &gt;50%, whereas the mortality rate of COVID-19 infected patients is &lt; 5%, and&#xD;
      both viruses cause acute lung injury and share similar pulmonary pathologies. NP-120 has also&#xD;
      been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory responses and reduce pulmonary fibrosis in a murine&#xD;
      model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a complication which can occur after a respiratory&#xD;
      virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the fact that H5N1 has a significantly higher mortality rate than COVID-19 but still&#xD;
      shares similar lung pathologies, Algernon Pharmaceuticals believes Ifenprodil could reduce&#xD;
      lung injury associated with COVID-19 infection, thereby improving lung function and&#xD;
      accelerating patient recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Phase 2b/3 trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of NP-120 in the&#xD;
      treatment of COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
