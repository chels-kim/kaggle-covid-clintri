  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COVID-19 may suffer from profound hypoxia, requiring the use of supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen at high concentrations and flow rates. Non-invasive oxygen delivery systems such as&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation have been used in an attempt to avoid&#xD;
      the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. These systems consume large&#xD;
      amounts of oxygen, which prevents them from being used in areas without high pressure oxygen&#xD;
      sources. In addition, they generate aerosols which have the potential to spread infectious&#xD;
      pathogens from the patient's respiratory tract to healthcare workers or other patients in the&#xD;
      environment. This study aims to investigate a computer controlled rebreather system which&#xD;
      functions to maintain a high fraction of inspired oxygen while minimizing the production of&#xD;
      aerosol, among hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support due to hypoxemia. The&#xD;
      Revoxa Oxygen Rebreather device can reduce the amount of wasted oxygen and can reduce the&#xD;
      potential for any exhaled pathogens entering the surroundings. This type of breathing device&#xD;
      is a promising oxygen delivery treatment, but it is not clear if it can offer comparable&#xD;
      results to standard treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the Revoxa Oxygen&#xD;
      Rebreather device to standard oxygen delivery methods, including nasal cannula and face mask&#xD;
      oxygen, in order to see if similar oxygenation can be achieved at comparable or lower rates&#xD;
      of oxygen usage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate a two-phase rebreather system (Revoxa Oxygen Rebreather&#xD;
      device) among hospitalized patients requiring oxygen therapy. This system can deliver a high&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) using a very low flow oxygen source with reduced or no&#xD;
      aerosolization. This could provide effective respiratory support with reduced waste and risk&#xD;
      of spreading of infectious particles. Such a device could also be used in field hospitals and&#xD;
      other makeshift care centers in the event of a surge in demand, because it obviates the need&#xD;
      for the type of high-flow oxygen infrastructure that is typically limited to hospital&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective comparative study of sequential interventions to evaluate the ability&#xD;
      of the Revoxa Oxygen Rebreather device (RO) to improve and maintain oxygen saturation at&#xD;
      satisfactory levels compared to conventional low-flow supplemental oxygen delivery (COD) via&#xD;
      nasal cannula or face mask. Prior to conducting study procedures in the patient population,&#xD;
      feasibility of trial procedures will be determined among 3 healthy adults (Group A). The&#xD;
      initial procedural test in a healthy sample will not be included in the endpoint assessment.&#xD;
      Following initial trial conduct in a healthy sample, 20 adult patients requiring supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen will be recruited: adults with non-severe hypoxemia (Group B), followed by enrollment&#xD;
      of adults with hypoxemia of any severity not requiring mechanical ventilation (Group C).&#xD;
      Baseline measures of oxygen saturation, oxygen flow rate, vital signs (respiratory rate,&#xD;
      heart rate, and blood pressure), and patient self-reported dyspnea and comfort will be&#xD;
      recorded prior to initiating treatment. Following baseline measurement, either conventional&#xD;
      low-flow oxygen delivery or oxygen via the Revoxa Oxygen Rebreather device will be initiated&#xD;
      for 20 minutes, followed by the other modality for 20 minutes. To avoid any bias that may be&#xD;
      introduced by a fixed sequence of device utilization (eg. COD, then RO), the order in which&#xD;
      devices are used will be determined quasi-randomly based on whether the patient is enrolled&#xD;
      on an odd numbered day, or an even numbered day. Vital signs, supplemental oxygen, and&#xD;
      self-reported dyspnea measures are captured during both treatment regimens. Participants may&#xD;
      verbally withdraw at any time by contacting one of the clinical or research staff. At that&#xD;
      point, all data collection relating to the withdrawn study participant will be terminated. If&#xD;
      the participant wishes, all existing data will be deleted (with the exception of the signed&#xD;
      consent form and data related to the consent withdrawal - including the reason for the&#xD;
      withdrawal). Additional participants will be recruited to maintain an adequate sample size in&#xD;
      the event that participants are withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
