      The benefit of the research is to provide information regarding the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Favipiravir plus the Standard of Care (SoC) for mild-moderate COVID-19 patients to be a&#xD;
      reference for policy recommendations regarding the use of Favipiravir as an antiviral drug&#xD;
      for the treatment of Covid-19.&#xD;

      Pre-screening is assessing patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening&#xD;
      was carried out to assess whether the subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Randomization was performed to determine the study drug allocation. The research subjects&#xD;
      were inpatients at selected hospitals and at the time of recruitment, the time was called D1.&#xD;
      The next day is called D2 and so on Follow-up will be carried out from the first day of&#xD;
      recruitment, taking medication up to a maximum of 19 days for test drugs and 11 days for SoC&#xD;
      drugs. Recording of clinical and laboratory manifestations will be carried out from&#xD;
      recruitment until the patient returns from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be recorded in a case report form, and if a case of clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      manifestations is found to be severe, it will be written on the adverse case report form and&#xD;
      reported immediately according to standard GCP procedures. Subjects may also drop out of the&#xD;
      study due to discontinuation of follow-up or a protocol violation&#xD;
