  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, in France, in the context of the SARS Cov2 pandemic,both the number of affected&#xD;
      subjects and the number of severe forms requiring hospital care are increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several nosocomial transmission clusters have already been identified in hospitals (both&#xD;
      pediatric and adult) but there is still limited data on the nosocomial spread of SARS-Cov2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This nosocomial transmission affects both patients and caregivers. It is important to&#xD;
      understand the spread of the virus within the hospital. This will help to optimize procedures&#xD;
      to prevent transmission to caregivers and hospitalizedpatients not infected with SARS Cov2,&#xD;
      and more generally this will contribute to control the spread of SARS Cov2 in the community&#xD;

      It is an observational study without any risk. Every participating service will be&#xD;
      investigated for 2 consecutive days .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each staff rotation, an individualsensorwill be provided toall thestaff(caregivers,&#xD;
           administrative, students etc…) to be worn duringtheirworking hours. Also a sensor will&#xD;
           be placed at each patient's bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, epidemiological data relating to socio-demographic characteristics,&#xD;
           profession, protective measures will be collectedfrom hospitalstaff. Also, some data&#xD;
           from the 'entrepot des données de santé&quot; regarding individual carepathways in the&#xD;
           hospitalwill be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A map of the unit, specifying the location of each patient will be made.&#xD;

        Working caregivers and hospitalized patients in care services dedicated or not to SARS Cov2&#xD;
        (including resuscitation services) in both adult and pediatric hospitals. Investigator will&#xD;
        be interested in both adult and child services because the latter present a&#xD;
        pauci-symptomatic form so the dynamics of transmission can be different.&#xD;
