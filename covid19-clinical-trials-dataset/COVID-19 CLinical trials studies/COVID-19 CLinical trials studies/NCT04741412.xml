    <textblock>
      Longitudinal study of 56 households with at least one member who had COVID-19 to compare the&#xD;
      course of illness, immune responses, and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in&#xD;
      HED patients with those of control subjects of the same age group. Complete households are&#xD;
      investigated, including women who are pregnant when exposed to the virus and their newborn&#xD;
      child(ren).&#xD;
