  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of AVM0703 administered as a&#xD;
      single intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with moderate or severe immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 or influenza (A&#xD;
      or B). The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      single dose of AVM0703 in these ARDS patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      dose of AVM0703 in patients with moderate, severe or immediately life-threatening ARDS due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 or Influenza (A or B) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 2)&#xD;
      evaluate potential clinical findings following a single dose of AVM0703.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective of the study is to assess potential biomarkers indicative of&#xD;
      natural killer T (NKT) cell activity and biomarkers predictive of response to AVM0703 in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the Phase 1 study will guide the design of the Phase 2 study.&#xD;
