      Study title Spanish Registry of Pregnant Women with COVID-19 Protocol number and version&#xD;
      Number 55/20. Version V8. Sponsors This registry is a project promoted by Dr. Oscar Martínez&#xD;
      Pérez of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of the Puerta de Hierro University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator of the registry National coordinator: Dr. Óscar Martínez Pérez.&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department. Puerta de Hierro University Hospital. Majadahonda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologist: Maria Luisa de la Cruz Conti Researchers for each site: 100 sites from 32&#xD;
      Spanish provinces are included (Appendix 1) Funding Neither the hospitals nor the&#xD;
      participating investigators will receive any financial compensation for their collaboration.&#xD;
      A bank account has been opened at the hospital's Biomedical Research Foundation to receive&#xD;
      donations: COV20/00021 - SARS-COV-2 and the COVID-19 disease Call financed by the Carlos III&#xD;
      Institute of Health and co-financed with ERDF funds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract Rationale: Knowledge about the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on pregnancy is still&#xD;
      scarce and all current recommendations are based on less than 100 cases published in the&#xD;
      literature. To identify moderate effects (such as vertical transmission, obstetric morbidity,&#xD;
      foetal death, maternal or neonatal death) and to allow accurate risk estimates, larger sample&#xD;
      sizes than those currently available are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective observational study of pregnant women in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection is&#xD;
      suspected at any time during pregnancy with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, in order to&#xD;
      create a registry of baseline characteristics of the pregnant woman, aspects related to the&#xD;
      course of pregnancy and delivery, and related to the new-born, with an observation period of&#xD;
      up to 14 days after delivery. Subsequently, several phased studies will be conducted to help&#xD;
      establish and monitor the set of measures to improve the care of pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The national registry for COVID-19 in pregnancy described here is a tool for&#xD;
      sharing and centralizing data related to exposures to SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy in a&#xD;
      structured way. It should speed up the process of prospectively obtaining a large unbiased&#xD;
      data set and will collect information at national level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale To date, few studies have described the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on&#xD;
      pregnancy, particularly infection occurring during the third trimester of pregnancy. The&#xD;
      impact of the virus during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy remains unknown and&#xD;
      must be urgently determined. All current recommendations are based on less than 50 cases&#xD;
      published in the literature, with speculations on different aspects of management. To&#xD;
      identify moderate effects (such as vertical transmission, foetal death, maternal or neonatal&#xD;
      death), larger sample sizes than those currently available are required to allow accurate&#xD;
      risk estimates. The national registry for COVID-19 in pregnancy described here is a tool for&#xD;
      sharing and centralizing data related to exposures to SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy in a&#xD;
      structured way. It should speed up the process of prospectively obtaining a large unbiased&#xD;
      data set and will collect information at national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis and objectives Hypothesis The COVID 19 disease affects pregnancy and has an&#xD;
      influence on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality Objectives This study focuses on&#xD;
      the creation of a registry of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, which will help&#xD;
      establish and monitor the set of measures to improve their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective Collect and analyse COVID-19 cases in pregnant and postpartum women at&#xD;
      associated health centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish incidence of COVID-19 infections diagnosed in pregnant women in the Spanish&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the variables that are associated with more maternal and neonatal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if there is vertical transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterize the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (for example,&#xD;
           severity of maternal symptoms, distribution of gestational age at onset, ICU admission,&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation, death).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quantify the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., miscarriage, stillbirth, growth&#xD;
           restriction) and neonatal outcomes (e.g., NICU, prematurity, death, birth defects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Identify additional risk factors and risk modifiers (e.g., symptomatic infection,&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 positive amniotic fluid, co-infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Develop a responsive data collection tool across a network of healthcare facilities to&#xD;
           ensure rapid assessment of risks associated with future emerging pathogens and to help&#xD;
           develop guidelines on this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Strengthen capacity-building in data exchange against emerging pathogens. The collected&#xD;
           dataset will allow a comprehensive characterization of the risks associated with&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. In the future, the developed structure will allow a&#xD;
           rapid assessment of the risks linked to future emerging pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective observational registry study of pregnant women with suspected&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection at any time during pregnancy with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific database will be developed, which will include the baseline characteristics of the&#xD;
      pregnant women, aspects related to the course of pregnancy and childbirth, and the new-born.&#xD;
      Vertical transmission will be analysed only by means of a nasopharyngeal swab from the&#xD;
      new-born before contact with the mother. This registry sets an observation deadline of up to&#xD;
      14 days after birth for the new-born and 6 weeks postpartum for the mother. The registry will&#xD;
      be hosted on a secure https server, this server will be physically located at OBS Covid Spain&#xD;
      of the company ReserArch which has a contract with the Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda&#xD;
      University Hospital Research Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment period will be between 1st March 2020 and 1st March 2021. After that, different&#xD;
      sub-analyses will be carried out with the data extracted in the registry and the secondary&#xD;
      objectives will be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Definition of case and healthy patient for the study The result in the PCR test&#xD;
      on a sample of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab was considered synonymous with&#xD;
      exposure/non-exposure, defining a case as any pregnant woman with a positive result,&#xD;
      regardless of the symptoms. Those cases with clinical presentation of COVID-19 were&#xD;
      classified according to the WHO division for adults into: mild symptoms, mild-moderate&#xD;
      pneumonia, severe pneumonia and septic shock (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended samples for diagnosis are samples from the upper respiratory tract:&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A healthy patient is considered to have a negative PCR in the absence of symptoms. Patients&#xD;
      with positive IgM or IgG serology cannot be included. The absence of serology does not&#xD;
      prevent classifying the patient as healthy if the PCR is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of symptomatic and asymptomatic patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute symptomatic patient: Positive PCR. Manifests any of the symptoms compatible with&#xD;
           COVID-19 at the time of the study or analysis or during admission. These symptoms may&#xD;
           vary based on new findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic patient: Patients with symptoms before 14 days of delivery, even if they no&#xD;
           longer have symptoms at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asymptomatic patient: Positive PCR. No symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were observed&#xD;
           at the time of the study or analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ex-symptomatic or cured patient: Positive or negative PCR. The patient was symptomatic&#xD;
           (PCR+) more than 14 days before delivery and no longer has any of the symptoms&#xD;
           compatible with COVID-19 at the time of the study or analysis. Patient can be IgM&#xD;
           positive or negative, but shall be IgG+ if serology is available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic patient with sequelae: Positive or negative PCR. The patient was symptomatic&#xD;
           (PCR+) and has any of the sequelae recognized after COVID-19 at the time of data&#xD;
           analysis. These sequelae may vary based on new findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall sample size Currently, the percentage of pregnant patients who are being diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19 is unknown, this being one of the objectives of the study. The registry&#xD;
      includes 100 sites that in 2019 cared for a total of 172,000 deliveries (Appendix 1 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources and work plan Patient referral sources If the doctor in charge considers it&#xD;
      appropriate to inform the patient about the existence and purpose of this registry, he/she&#xD;
      may do so. At this time, consent will be requested so that the information derived from the&#xD;
      regular monitoring of these patients is incorporated into the data registry, and that said&#xD;
      information can be analysed and disclosed for scientific purposes in accord with the&#xD;
      confidentiality provisions of the current legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Encrypted health-related personal data is collected prospectively using the&#xD;
      OBS Covid Spain database of the company ReserArch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of data on each pregnant woman is planned from the diagnosis of a case in a&#xD;
      pregnancy up to 6 weeks after delivery and up to 14 days postpartum in the case of the&#xD;
      new-born, based on a manual prepared for the collection of data and for the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitals enrol their pregnant patients on an ongoing basis, and the information is collected&#xD;
      and stored anonymously in two separate phases: the first phase, during the inclusion period&#xD;
      that occurs at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 test in the pregnant woman; the second phase,&#xD;
      throughout the 2 weeks after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sites with existing cohorts using methods that comply with registry data collection&#xD;
      methods (i.e., systematic inclusion of women screened for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of test&#xD;
      results, prospective follow-up, and information requested as shown in the variables table of&#xD;
      appendix 5), the data collected will be entered at the time they join the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery monitoring: the outcomes include perinatal and neonatal events, which were collected&#xD;
      at the time of delivery and the days immediately afterward. These perinatal events included&#xD;
      gestational age, type of delivery, presence of prepartum or premature rupture of membranes&#xD;
      before delivery, as well as any medical complications (thromboembolic events, admission to&#xD;
      ICU, maternal death) and obstetric complications (hemorrhagic events and hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders), while neonatal events included the 5-minute Apgar score, the pH of the umbilical&#xD;
      artery and possible complications such as admission to the NICU and neonatal death in the&#xD;
      follow-up period or intrauterine foetal death. The definitions of obstetric pathology follow&#xD;
      the international criteria of the ACOG and RCOG (18-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after delivery: Patient follow-up is carried out by the local investigator over the&#xD;
      phone and the medical history is consulted from the time the patient is discharged up to 6&#xD;
      weeks later in order to detect late postpartum complications related to COVID 19. In the case&#xD;
      of the new-born, the follow-up is 14 days by the investigating neonatology department by&#xD;
      telephone and consultation of the patient's medical history to detect symptoms of COVID 19&#xD;
      symptoms. Complications recorded in the mother during this period (mastitis, endometritis,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism) as well as neonatal death or readmission of the new-born due to COVID 19&#xD;
      were considered outcomes of interest and analysed together with those previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality assurance plan Several strategies have been implemented to reduce data errors,&#xD;
      including a limited number of open questions, a predefined range of values where applicable,&#xD;
      an easy-to-use case report form build that uses branching logic to reduce fields to complete,&#xD;
      one person per site assigned to data collection, correction of systematic inconsistencies and&#xD;
      verification of outliers. The different forms that will be used to collect the data in a&#xD;
      systematic way are shown in appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterogeneity tests Populations from diverse genetic, socio-cultural and socio-economic&#xD;
      backgrounds can be quite different in their characteristics. Additionally, there may be some&#xD;
      disparities between sites with respect to the quality and quantity of data items that each&#xD;
      site can measure. This is expected regarding a data collection that allows any site to&#xD;
      contribute. Consequently, heterogeneity in effect estimates may be due to clinical&#xD;
      differences between pregnant women and/or site-level differences in terms of exposure and&#xD;
      outcome determination (reporting or assessment bias). We will formally assess heterogeneity&#xD;
      taking into account variations in exposure, covariates, and significant outcomes, and use&#xD;
      meta-analysis methods (Q or I2 statistics, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis) to unravel&#xD;
      heterogeneity at central and individual levels. Briefly, we will incorporate individual-level&#xD;
      interaction terms in one-stage analysis and random intercepts to account for central-level&#xD;
      factors not measured in the regression models mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXTRACTION OF DATA FROM THE REGISTRY: SUBSTUDIES Based on the registry prepared, data&#xD;
      extraction will be carried out to carry out four sub-studies that address the secondary&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1: Prospective observational study on delivery and vertical transmission to the&#xD;
      new-born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/s&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the variables that are associated with more maternal and neonatal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;

        3. Evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Characterize the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection during delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify additional risk factors and risk modifiers (e.g., symptomatic infection,&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 positive amniotic fluid, co-infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective observational study in 100 Spanish sites Recruitment: 1st March 2020 to&#xD;
      1st March 2021. Spanish sites collected in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients eligible for follow-up or target population will be any pregnant woman who&#xD;
      is suspected of or needs to be ruled out as having SARS-CoV-2 infection at any time during&#xD;
      pregnancy with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the PCR test on a sample of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab was&#xD;

                morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quantify the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., miscarriage, stillbirth,&#xD;
                growth restriction) and neonatal outcomes (e.g., NICU, prematurity, death, birth&#xD;
                defects).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design Longitudinal cohort case study to quantify the obstetrical and perinatal&#xD;
           morbi-mortality throughout all hospitals in Spain with a universal, consecutive PCR&#xD;
           based screening program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment: 1st March 2020 to 1st March 2021. Spanish sites collected in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients Case eligibility criteria included individuals with laboratory confirmation of&#xD;
           COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms or the result of another&#xD;
           serological test. Positive RNA PCR test from maternal nasopharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The selection of the control group will be collected in the same database, considering&#xD;
           patients with negative COVID-19 delivery diagnosed by PCR screening at the time of&#xD;
           delivery or less than 3 days before.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The delivery or deliveries that were treated in this site and that occurred within the&#xD;
           same day, before and after the case (maximum 3 per case), are included in the control&#xD;
           group. If the case were the last delivery of the day, the first ones of the following&#xD;
           day could be recruited. If the case were the first of that day, the last one of the&#xD;
           previous day could be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collected will be entered at the time they join the registry. Delivery&#xD;
           monitoring: the outcomes include perinatal and neonatal events, which were collected at&#xD;
           the time of delivery and the days immediately afterward. These perinatal events included&#xD;
           gestational age, type of delivery, presence of prepartum or premature rupture of&#xD;
           membranes before delivery, as well as any medical complications (thromboembolic events,&#xD;
           admission to ICU, maternal death) and obstetric complications (hemorrhagic events and&#xD;
           hypertensive disorders), while neonatal events included the 5-minute Apgar score, the pH&#xD;
           of the umbilical artery and possible complications such as admission to the NICU and&#xD;
           neonatal death in the follow-up period or intrauterine foetal death. The definitions of&#xD;
           obstetric pathology follow the international criteria of the ACOG and RCOG (18-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up after delivery: Patient follow-up is carried out by the local investigator&#xD;
           over the phone and the medical history is consulted from the time the patient is&#xD;
           discharged up to 6 weeks later in order to detect late postpartum complications related&#xD;
           to COVID 19. In the case of the new-born, the follow-up is 14 days by the investigating&#xD;
           neonatology department by telephone and consultation of the patient's medical history to&#xD;
           detect symptoms of COVID 19 symptoms. Complications recorded in the mother during this&#xD;
           period (mastitis, endometritis, pulmonary embolism) as well as neonatal death or&#xD;
           readmission of the new-born due to COVID were considered outcomes of interest and&#xD;
           analysed together with those described above.&#xD;

&#xD;
           The rest of the variables are described in appendix 5 Statistics For the descriptive&#xD;
           analysis, categorical variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies;&#xD;
           whereas quantitative ones were expressed as mean and range (minimum-maximum values).&#xD;
           Analysis of the possible association of both the characteristics of the patients and the&#xD;
           outcomes collected with COVID-19 infection is carried out using the Pearson Chi-square&#xD;
           test or Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test (after checking the absence of&#xD;
           normal data using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). See sections of Data Quality Plan and&#xD;
           sample size. Statistical significance was established with P &lt;0.05. All statistical&#xD;
           analyses were carried out with SAS 9.4 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each response variable (outcome) a multiple logistic regression model has been&#xD;
           carried out, refined with the backward conditional stepwise method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The response variables are those described in the previous section. The subset of&#xD;
           explanatory variables is different for each model and is specified in the text.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It will only be of interest the Odds Ratio (OR), its 95% CI and the significance of the&#xD;
           &quot;COVID&quot; factor. The information on the rest of the explanatory variables is irrelevant&#xD;
           since they only act as adjustment variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Substudy 4. Epidemiological prevalence study Objective/s Determine the prevalence of&#xD;
           SARS_COV2 infection in Spanish pregnant women Design Cross-sectional study. The nQuery&#xD;
           Advisor Release 7.0 software was used to calculate the sample size, based on the&#xD;
           available data. As we do not have data on the prevalence of COVID-19, we set an expected&#xD;
           percentage of 50% (a situation that maximizes the sample size) of asymptomatic women&#xD;
           during delivery. We determined the sample size for a COVID-19 delivery prevalence study&#xD;
           with an expected prevalence of 50%, a 95% confidence level and 5% accuracy, resulting in&#xD;
           a sample size of 1056 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The selection of pregnant women in the sample will follow the distribution of the&#xD;
           delivery rate by communities and hospitals in Spain according to the INE data for 2018&#xD;
           (Appendix 3) (15). Subsequently, a simple random selection procedure will be carried out&#xD;
           in each site, creating a numerical list of the women to be included in the sample&#xD;
           (Appendix 1). Pregnant women will be assigned a consecutive number from one onwards&#xD;
           according to their due date. Subsequently, the pregnant women who will be part of the&#xD;
           sample will be chosen when the number that identifies them is within the table&#xD;
           previously created through the random procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment: 1st March 2020 to 1st March 2021. Spanish sites collected in the Appendix 1&#xD;
           Patients Delivery of pregnant women in Spanish maternity wards with a diagnostic test&#xD;
           for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Single or multiple gestations of 24 weeks or more without a positive laboratory&#xD;
                test for COVID-19 prior to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Delivery in a public or private maternity hospital in Spain with a diagnostic test&#xD;
                for COVID-19 using PCR Kits within 72 hours prior to delivery or 24 hours after&#xD;
                delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The presence of comorbidity is not an exclusion criterion (asthma, diabetes&#xD;
                mellitus, hypertension-preeclampsia, endocrine disorder, dermatological pathology&#xD;
                or other obstetric or medical-surgical pathologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acceptance by the pregnant woman to participate in the study by means of informed&#xD;
                consent for group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The result of the PCR test on a sample of nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab was&#xD;
           considered synonymous with exposure/non-exposure, defining a case as any pregnant woman&#xD;
           with a positive result, regardless of the symptoms. Those cases with clinical&#xD;
           presentation of COVID-19 were classified according to the WHO division for adults into:&#xD;
           mild symptoms, mild-moderate pneumonia, severe pneumonia and septic shock (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recommended samples for diagnosis are samples from the upper respiratory tract:&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A healthy patient is considered to have a negative PCR in the absence of symptoms.&#xD;
           Patients with positive IgM or IgG serology cannot be included. The absence of serology&#xD;
           does not prevent classifying the patient as healthy if the PCR is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary variables&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age Delivery &lt; 37 weeks Race Delivery Type Weight at the beginning of pregnancy&#xD;
           Premature rupture of membranes Body Mass Index (BMI) Preterm PRM Blood type NICU&#xD;
           admission Single or Multiple NICU admission days IVF Postpartum haemorrhage Obesity BMI&gt;&#xD;
           30 Abruptio placentae Vascular comorbidities Severe Preeclampsia Pulmonary comorbidity&#xD;
           HELLP Maternal mortality Pulmonary embolism ICU admission COVID 19 diagnosis date&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rest of the variables are described in appendix 5 Statistics For the statistical&#xD;
           analysis, the SAS v9.4 software will be used. The set of groups of variables requested&#xD;
           and collected for each enrolled patient will be the same. The demographic and clinical&#xD;
           characteristics of the population included will be summarized. Mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
           minimum and maximum or median and interquartile intervals will be used for continuous&#xD;
           variables, according to the distribution. The corresponding absolute and relative&#xD;
           frequency will be reported for the discrete variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The possible association of both the characteristics of the patients and the outcomes&#xD;
           collected with COVID-19 infection using the Pearson Chi-square test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
           test and the Mann-Whitney U test (after checking the absence of normal data using the&#xD;
           Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Statistically significant associations were considered when&#xD;
           the p value was less than 0.05. For those categorical variables in which statistically&#xD;
           significant differences were identified, the corresponding Odds Ratio (OR) and 95%&#xD;
           Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were estimated using univariate logistic regression&#xD;
           models.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Logistic regressions, both univariate and multivariate, will be performed, determining&#xD;
           the odd ratio and its 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Management and reporting of adverse reactions As it is an epidemiological study without&#xD;
           a drug under study, the provisions on Pharmacovigilance in Ministerial Order&#xD;
           SAS/3470/2009 and Royal Decree 577/2013 in relation to reporting adverse reactions to&#xD;
           approved drugs will be followed. Investigators who are aware of possible adverse&#xD;
           reactions during the study should notify them as quickly as possible to the Autonomous&#xD;
           Center for Pharmacovigilance corresponding to their healthcare area, through any of the&#xD;
           channels that the institution makes available (through the yellow card system or via&#xD;
           online through the SINAEM website). It is also recommended that the Investigator (or&#xD;
           reporting doctor) reports all adverse reactions to the marketing authorization holder of&#xD;
           the drugs involved. Additionally, the conditions of use outside the marketing&#xD;
           authorization of the drug must be reported (e.g.: off-label use, overdose, misuse, abuse&#xD;
           and medication errors) or occupational exposure, as well as cases of suspected drug&#xD;
           interactions, pregnancy, exposure during breastfeeding and lack of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical aspects This study will be carried out under conditions of respect for the&#xD;
           fundamental rights of the person and the ethical principles that affect biomedical&#xD;
           research with human beings, following the international recommendations contained in the&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki, and its subsequent revisions. Likewise, national&#xD;
           recommendations will be followed in accordance with the Biomedical Research Law 14/2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the completion of this study, the investigators will strictly adhere to the&#xD;
           provisions of this protocol, fully completing the Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent In accordance with the criteria of good clinical practice, the subjects&#xD;
           will be duly informed of all those details concerning their participation in the study&#xD;
           and will freely give their consent in writing or orally, recording this fact in their&#xD;
           medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preferably written or oral consent will be sought for cases and controls chosen at&#xD;
           random from among pregnant women who have given birth in each centre and who have&#xD;
           COVID-19. The patient may sign the consent electronically (See appendix 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety Measures and Confidentiality Protection of human subjects: Pregnant women and&#xD;
           newborns participate in the registry as mentioned above. No biological samples are&#xD;
           collected for specific analysis in this study.&#xD;
