      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic. Little is known about the virus, so data is&#xD;
      needed to form an effective public health response. Researchers want to count how many people&#xD;
      have been exposed to COVID-19, learn about symptoms, and find out how many antibodies to the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus a person may have in their blood over 1 year. This data could affect the&#xD;
      response to current and future pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how many people from a sampling of adults in North Carolina develop antibodies to&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people age 18 and older who do not currently have COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have five 30-minute visits at the Clinical Research Unit. At each visit,&#xD;
      they will have blood drawn to see if they have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the test result is positive for antibodies, the participant will be tested to see if they&#xD;
      currently have COVID-19. For this, a nasal or throat swab will be done, or saliva will be&#xD;
      collected. They may do this test at the same visit as the blood draw, or they may schedule an&#xD;
      extra visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around the time of their study visits, participants will take an online survey about&#xD;
      themselves, their health, and COVID-19. It takes 10 minutes to complete. Every week for 52&#xD;
      weeks, they will also take a brief online survey about their symptoms. It takes 2 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. They will be emailed a link to log in and fill out the surveys on a secure website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that respiratory virus outbreaks and pandemics, such as influenza,&#xD;
      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.&#xD;
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and&#xD;
      immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through&#xD;
      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the&#xD;
      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to&#xD;
      current and future pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, single-center, exploratory, natural&#xD;
      history study to collect samples and data from individuals to identify the presence and rate&#xD;
      of development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in North Carolina.&#xD;
