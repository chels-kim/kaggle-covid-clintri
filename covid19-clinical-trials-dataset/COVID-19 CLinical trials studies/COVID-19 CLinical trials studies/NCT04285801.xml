  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel-coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the cause of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia&#xD;
      that started in Hubei province in China 1. It has manifest into a global health crisis with&#xD;
      escalating confirmed cases and spread across 15 countries. Whilst it is currently an epidemic&#xD;
      in China, The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Level risk assessment is set at high 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing showed that 2019-nCov is similar to bat severe acute syndrome (SARS)-related&#xD;
      coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats 3. This is compatible with the initial&#xD;
      epidemiological link with a local wet market which sells bats. Furthermore, data sharing and&#xD;
      sequencing data has facilitated development of accurate diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, our current understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of&#xD;
      2019-nCov is limited. In a case series of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed infection,&#xD;
      at least 30% of these patients required critical care admission. These patients developed&#xD;
      severe respiratory failure and 10% required mechanical ventilation and 5% needed&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. More worryingly 2019-nCov infection was&#xD;
      associated with 15% mortality. Although these figures are likely overestimates due to&#xD;
      unreported mild cases, there is currently no effective treatment. The optimal supportive care&#xD;
      for patients with severe 2019-nCov infection is a research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spread of the 2019-nCov epidemic to Hong Kong has started. Patients have been admitted to&#xD;
      the Intensive Care Unit for multiorgan dysfunction. Currently there are no published data&#xD;
      focused specifically on critically ill patients with nCov infection. The purpose of this case&#xD;
      series is to describe the characteristics, organ dysfunction and support and 2 week outcomes&#xD;
      of critically ill patients with nCov infection.&#xD;
