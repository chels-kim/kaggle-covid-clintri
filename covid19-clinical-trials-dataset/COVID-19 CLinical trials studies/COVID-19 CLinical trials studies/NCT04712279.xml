      Ivermectin, a classical antiparasitic and anti-scabies agent, has demonstrated antiviral&#xD;
      activity for a variety of viruses including chikungunya virus, zyka virus and dengue virus&#xD;
      and was tested as a potentially effective for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ivermectin demonstrated potent in vitro action by reducing viral load by 5000x after&#xD;
      48 hours of incubation, simultaneous pharmacokinetics simulations suggested that the minimum&#xD;
      effective concentrations would be unfeasible to be reached within safety range (EC-50 = 2&#xD;
      Micromol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the theoretical unfeasible concentrations to be achieved, preliminary&#xD;
      observational yet well-structured studies followed by randomized clinical trials (RCTs)&#xD;
      demonstrated ivermectin efficacy when combined with hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline or&#xD;
      azithromycin, which was corroborated by a recent systematic review and metanalysis. In&#xD;
      common, a dose-response effect for effectiveness was observed, and no adverse effects was&#xD;
      reported at any dose between 0.2mg/kg/day and 1.0mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the scientific rationale combined with the preliminary evidence, ivermectin has&#xD;
      sufficient evidence to be tested in higher doses in a RCT for COVID-19. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test ivermectin at high doses as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19, aiming to explore the possible protective role of high-dose ivermectin in&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of reduction of clinic and virologic disease duration, and&#xD;
      prevention of oxygen use, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and post-COVID&#xD;
      persisting symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has become a pandemic largely&#xD;
      due to a combination of favorable transmission and infection characteristics for its spread,&#xD;
      including prolonged preclinical or also asymptomatic yet transmitting period, relatively&#xD;
      highly resistant to mechanical and physical barriers and prolonged survival in the air, and&#xD;
      transmission patterns not yet fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While vaccines are not widely available, the number of new cases should not decrease&#xD;
      dramatically, unfortunately, since a large percentage of the population has not been infected&#xD;
      by the SARS-CoV-2 yet, reinfection becomes increasingly plausible with mutations in the&#xD;
      virus, and virus contention policies failed to be 100% effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering potential antiviral approaches for COVID-19, their effectiveness only make sense&#xD;
      if tested and given early in the disease, during viral dissemination. The learning that&#xD;
      oseltamivir is only effective for Influenza A in the first three days of disease finds strong&#xD;
      plausibility, and reinforces the expected lack of effectiveness of any drug with in vitro or&#xD;
      preliminary antiviral activity reported when tested in hospitalized or non-mild patients,&#xD;
      once COVID-19 presents tend to present mild symptoms during the viral dissemination stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An actual early detection of COVID-19, i.e., before its progression to further inflammatory&#xD;
      stages, is challenging, once the earliest symptoms tend to be unspecific, mild, and hardly&#xD;
      attributable to COVID-19. By suspecting of COVID-19 in the presence of any symptom, specific&#xD;
      to COVID-19 or not, sensitivity was met to be above 90% while specificity was also relatively&#xD;
      high (above 50%). In addition, time-to-treat, rather than which drug to choose, could better&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of a specific approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin: potential antiviral activity for COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among drugs potentially effective for COVID-19, despite the classical antiparasitic and&#xD;
      anti-scabies use, ivermectin has demonstrated antiviral activity for a variety of viruses by&#xD;
      inhibiting and reducing the viral shedding duration, including chikungunya and other&#xD;
      alphaviruses, zyka virus, dengue virus and other simple-strain RNA viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the search for drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, considering its effects on other&#xD;
      viruses, ivermectin was tested in a Vero-hSLAM cell model and demonstrated potent in vitro&#xD;
      action, by reducing viral load by 5000x after 48 hours of incubation. However, after initial&#xD;
      promising results, simultaneous pharmacokinetics simulations suggested that the minimum&#xD;
      effective concentrations would be unfeasible to be reached within safety range (EC-50 = 2&#xD;
      Micromol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the theoretical minimum concentration required for antiviral action was apparently&#xD;
      at least 17 times higher than the lethal dose and up to 10,000 times the usually prescribed&#xD;
      doses for humans ( IC50 of 2.2 - 2.8 ÂµM for monkeys), which would reduce the chances of&#xD;
      ivermectin efficacy for COVID-19, preliminary observational yet well-structured studies&#xD;
      demonstrated substantial synergistic action of ivermectin when added to &quot;standard of care&quot;,&#xD;
      usually hydroxychloroquine with or without macrolides. In a specific study, the use of&#xD;
      ivermectin, even in low doses, reduced by 40% the absolute risk of death among patients more&#xD;
      severely affected by COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated efficacy of ivermectin when combined with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline or azithromycin, in both mildly (and presumedly early) and&#xD;
      more severely affected subjects with COVID-19. Demonstrated benefits included lower disease&#xD;
      progression and reduced COVID-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparative analyses, combinations between ivermectin and azithromycin, doxycycline or&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine demonstrated superiority compared to combinations between&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanisms of action remain nuclear. At least one study employing higher doses&#xD;
      (0.6mg/kg/day) demonstrated in vivo antiviral activity, but only when maximum concentration&#xD;
      reached serum levels above 160 ng/ml, which only occurred in 45% of subjects, even at higher&#xD;
      doses. The antiviral mechanisms include modification in the ACE-2 glycation patterns,&#xD;
      inhibition of the viral Helicase (NSP13) and disruption of the alpha-importin heterodimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent systematic review and metanalysis, a dose-response correlation has also been&#xD;
      observed in terms of endpoints, reinforcing the role of ivermectin as actins as an&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 action drug. However, even in lower doses ivermectin was able to demonstrate&#xD;
      clinical benefits, allowing the hypothesis that ivermectin also exerts anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects, which could include the blockage of STAT-1 migration to the nucleus, and could&#xD;
      justify its use even at later stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, higher yet safe ivermectin doses find stronger plausibility and preliminary&#xD;
      evidence to be tested in RCTs. In addition, approaches to increase ivermectin absorption and&#xD;
      bioavailability should be encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the scientific rationale combined with preliminary evidence, ivermectin has&#xD;
      sufficient evidence to be tested at higher doses in a RCT for COVID-19. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test ivermectin at high doses as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19. This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of high-dose&#xD;
      ivermectin in SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of reduction of clinic and virologic disease&#xD;
      duration, and prevention of oxygen use, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and&#xD;
      post-COVID persisting symptoms.&#xD;
