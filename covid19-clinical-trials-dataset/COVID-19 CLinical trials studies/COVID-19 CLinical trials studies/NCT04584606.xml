      COVID-19 as a novel disease, different disease patterns were observed worldwide, and many&#xD;
      treatment plans were tried. So, it is important to investigate the Egyptian clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and different factors that determine the patient's 'outcome&#xD;

      Investigators will convey the Ain Shams University experience as the first university in&#xD;
      Egypt to designate one of its hospitals (Ain Shams University Obour Hospital) for management&#xD;
      of confirmed COVID19 cases. investigators will try to identify the characteristics of the&#xD;
      disease as regards the clinical, laboratory and imaging abnormalities and to assess the&#xD;
      outcome determinants. It is a retrospective observational cohort study at Ain Shams&#xD;
      University Obour Hospital. All adult patients from both sexes with positive nucleic acid&#xD;
      testing for severe adult respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical criteria, laboratory data, radiological findings, hospital course and patient&#xD;
      outcome will be anonymously collected from records.&#xD;
