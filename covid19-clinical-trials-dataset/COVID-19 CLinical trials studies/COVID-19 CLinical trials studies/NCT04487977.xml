      The objectives of this study are to analyze the best device for intubation in patients&#xD;
      infected by SARS-CoV2 virus during COVID-19 pandemics and to review the optimal methods for&#xD;
      airway management in such patients for elective surgery and in the Critical Care environment.&#xD;
      Also, the safest methods for airway management in thoracic surgery will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a descriptive design with no hypothesis contrast, and it will explore the&#xD;
      current picture in airway management in Spain. It is a multicentric international study, for&#xD;
      all the centers where intubations of tracheostomies have been performed in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV2 with positive PCR, either in the Critical Care setting or the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey will be distributed among professionals who have been involved in airway management&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients in the following specialties: Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine,&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine, Prehospital Medicine, Cardiology and Pulmonology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study started on april 2020 after receiving approval from the Ethics Committee (General&#xD;
      University Hospital of Valencia) COVID-19 infection causes respiratory failure needing&#xD;
      ventilatory support, which required endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. This situation&#xD;
      poses a significant risk of transmission due to its usual urgent nature, and it often happens&#xD;
      in the context of respiratory claudication. For this reason, studying the safest and useful&#xD;
      methods for airway management in this kind of patients, using data based on the clinical&#xD;
      experience, may be of great interest in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Software R, . Technical&#xD;
      characteristics will be described using frequencies and percentages for categorical&#xD;
      variables, and means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for&#xD;
      continuous variables, depending on normality tests. Base characteristics, center and years of&#xD;
      experience will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation is not necessary, since it is an explorative and voluntary study,&#xD;
      trying to establish which are the regular routines in airway management in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      in Spain and Latin America.&#xD;

      1. Justification There are no studies about safety and effectiveness of different airway&#xD;
           management procedures in COVID-19 patients in Spain or Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the emergent nature of this disease, there are very few solid and universal&#xD;
           publications about safety or validated protocols in SARS-CoV-2 disease airway&#xD;
           management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the last months, and following the clinical experience coming from China and Italy,&#xD;
           we have been able to see how SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused severe morbidity or death in&#xD;
           thousands of patients. In this line, and considering the high transmission rate of this&#xD;
           disease, we observe how professionals from these countries have performed airway&#xD;
           management to provide proper ventilation and oxygenation, in either potentially&#xD;
           critically ill patients or in a surgical context. Their experience has allowed other&#xD;
           countries to develop specific protocols, and to quickly adapt them to the updates that&#xD;
           keep happening daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For this reason, we want to explore the Spanish and Latin American experience in airway&#xD;
           management. It is important to draw conclusions not only from the preparations and&#xD;
           technical approaches, but also the information stemming from the context in which the&#xD;
           procedure is performed, the stress derived from the risk of transmission and the&#xD;
           personal protective equipment, as well as the particular difficulties they add to the&#xD;
           technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis: Since it is a descriptive study, there is no formal hypothesis in this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Main objective: To analyze the preferred device for intubation in patients infected&#xD;
           by SARS-CoV2 virus during COVID-19 pandemics using a survey addressed to health care&#xD;
           professionals experienced in assistance to COVID-19 patients. The preferred device will&#xD;
           be rated using an ordinal scoring scale and it will be presented as the device with the&#xD;
           highest score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Secondary objectives: To assess the preferred methods for airway management in&#xD;
           COVID-19 patients in a Critical Care setting or undergoing urgent or elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design: Descriptive design with no hypothesis contrast, exploring the current panorama&#xD;
           in airway management in Spain and Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;

           patients with a positive PCR, either in the Critical Care setting or in the operating&#xD;
           room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: The study population will consist of all the health care professionals&#xD;
           who have been or are currently involved in airway management in COVID-19 positive&#xD;
           patients, from the following medical specialties: Anesthesiology and Critical Care&#xD;

           with a free access plan which allows quick and development of digital surveys with no&#xD;
           need for programming. It also includes a set of tools to distribute and gather the&#xD;

           other digital distribution methods to the potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Interventions and procedures: There is no need for interventions on patients or their&#xD;
           clinical records. A single intervention will take place on the participants in the&#xD;
           moment of sending the survey. This only contact will provide all the aforementioned&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Sample size calculation: There is no need for sample size calculation, since the study&#xD;
           is explorative and voluntary, trying to assess clinical routines in airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Statistical plan: Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Software R, .&#xD;
           Technical characteristics will be described using frequencies and percentages for&#xD;
           categorical variables, and means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile&#xD;
           ranges for continuous variables, depending on normality tests. Base characteristics,&#xD;
           center and years of experience will be compared. Proper figures will be presented to&#xD;
           represent the results about which are the most used techniques and devices, as well as&#xD;
           the most important features of every procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.1. General considerations: The study is to be conducted according to this protocol,&#xD;
      Helsinki Ethical Principles Declaration and currently existing directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2. Informed consent: An informed consent form is not necessary, since the survey will be&#xD;
      completed by professionals who provided care to the patients in a retrospective manner, with&#xD;
      no diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Besides, since it is a retrospective study with&#xD;
      anonymous data, there is no possibility to ask for an informed consent to the patients. For&#xD;
      these reasons, an exemption for informed consent was requested and accepted by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.3. Data protection: Data from the participants will be managed according to existing&#xD;
      spanish and european laws (Spanish Law 3/2018 on Personal Data Protection and Digital Rights&#xD;
      Warranty, and EU Regulation UE 2016/679). Gathered data for the study will be identified with&#xD;
      a code, and the information will not include identificatory details of the participants, thus&#xD;
      not being able to reveal their identities. Names of patients will not be collected or&#xD;
      presented in any publication or communication of the study results.&#xD;
