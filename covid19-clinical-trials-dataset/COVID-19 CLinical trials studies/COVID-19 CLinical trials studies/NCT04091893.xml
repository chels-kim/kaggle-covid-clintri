  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To conduct a formative evaluation of museum-based programming to address loneliness&#xD;
      and social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To develop a consensus-derived Model Museum-Based Program (MMBP) to address loneliness&#xD;
      among individuals with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the feasibility of museum experiences to reduce loneliness and pain among&#xD;
      isolated individuals with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to safety concerns related to the covid pandemic in-person museum programming could not&#xD;
      continue and virtual versions of the interventions were created. We will publish results on&#xD;
      both the in-person and virtual versions of the intervention as well as a pooled analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The PCS is a 13 item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale between: 0 (Not at all) and 4 (all the time). The PCS is broken into three subscales including: magnification, rumination, and helplessness. The total range of scores is between 0-52 with higher values reflecting more salient impacts of pain on one's day to day experience.</description>
