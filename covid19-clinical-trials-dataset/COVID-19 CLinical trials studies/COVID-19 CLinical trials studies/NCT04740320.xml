      The aim of this screening protocol is to assess volunteers for their potential eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in a dose finding human experimental infection study in healthy subjects using a&#xD;
      GMP-produced SARS-CoV-2 wild type strain&#xD;

      Recruitment will be done through a number of channels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approved advertising, including social medial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hVIVO volunteer database&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organic search, i.e. where the volunteer has learned of this study by doing a Google&#xD;
           search or through friends or family rather than due to any advertising Following&#xD;
           Research Ethics Committee approval of the full study, screened subjects who confirm&#xD;
           their willingness to participate in the SARS-CoV-2 human infection challenge&#xD;
           characterization study will be invited to consider the study-specific PIS-ICF and enter&#xD;
           the final study consenting process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects who are to be recruited will depend on specific sample-size&#xD;
      requirements for the SARS-CoV-2 human infection characterization study.&#xD;

    <description>Volunteers asked to register details on a SARS-CoV-2 specific web page UKcovidchallenge.com. They will be contacted with a short webform questionnaire to be performed prior to a follow-up telephone questionnaire or will be asked to complete a telephone questionnaire. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, appointment for a screening visit will be scheduled. Screening appointments will be conducted at hVIVO. Written consent for screening will be obtained prior to any history-taking, examination or tests are carried out. Medical history will be requested from GP to assess suitability. Once the SARS-CoV-2 characterization study is approved, potential participants will be given the study specific PIS detailing the full study and experimental procedures. The opportunity to discuss further and ask questions will be available prior to booking a study visit.</description>

      Samples of tissue, cells and fluids will be stored according to Imperial College London and&#xD;
      hVIVO SOPs as appropriate. Samples will be pseudoanonymised with participant identification&#xD;
      numbers only and the anonymisation key kept in a separate locked location accessible only to&#xD;
      the hVIVO clinical study team. Samples may be used for further assays or in other ethically&#xD;
      approved studies. Samples and data may be shared with UK and international collaborators in&#xD;
      studies that have been approved by local ethics committees and subject to a valid Materials&#xD;
      Transfer Agreement. At the end of the study any remaining samples will be either destroyed,&#xD;
      transferred to the sponsor or subject to consent, transfer to and maintained under hVIVOs HTA&#xD;
