  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on studies in China, Iceland, the Netherlands and Italy it seems that children are less&#xD;
      affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections and play a lesser role in the dissemination of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is unclear to which extend this is due to lesser exposure or an inherent&#xD;
      decreased susceptibility to become infected. The low reported number of cases in children can&#xD;
      be partially explained by the lower testing rates in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get insight in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus in school-aged children it is&#xD;
      necessary to compile data on infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the child and (pre-)adolescent&#xD;
      population. The main objective of this study is to determine the sero-prevalence and&#xD;
      sero-conversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of school-aged children (primary&#xD;
      and secondary school) in Belgium at different time points. Additionally this study will gain&#xD;
      insight in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, the proportion of asymptomatic infections with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and the role of COVID-19 infection in household members. It will give us the&#xD;
      possibility to investigate potential risk factors for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes primary and secondary school children from two predefined age&#xD;
      groups (8-9 and 13-14 years old). These two groups are chosen because studies have shown more&#xD;
      pronounced symptoms of infection and disease depending on age and because transmission&#xD;
      dynamics also vary by age. The study population will be recruited in all Belgian schools&#xD;
      including Brussels-Capital, Flemish and Walloon Region (including the German speaking&#xD;
      community).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective cohort study. In total there will be 3 testing points with 3&#xD;
      months between each point. The sample size calculation indicated the inclusion of 41 randomly&#xD;
      selected primary and 41 secondary schools and in each school 20 randomly selected pupils of&#xD;
      the defined age groups. Parents/legal child caregiver will complete a questionnaire at each&#xD;
      of the testing points providing basic socio-demographic characteristics (at baseline only)&#xD;
      and risk-behavior and health characteristics including presence of symptoms during the time&#xD;
      since the previous testing point (at each of the testing points). The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed through a secured online application during the same week as the child had the&#xD;
      saliva sample for serological testing taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be sent to the Sciensano laboratory for serological analysis. The child's&#xD;
      parent/legal caregiver will be informed of the serological result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will guide the Belgian policy makers in their advices to limit circulation of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium and more specifically in their advice on measures for school-age&#xD;
      children. This data might also be used to guide health authorities that have to decide on&#xD;
      vaccination strategies once a vaccine is available; to decide whether children should be&#xD;
      included for vaccination to create herd immunity or not.&#xD;

        The study population includes primary and secondary school children from two predefined age&#xD;
        groups. These two groups are chosen because studies have shown more pronounced symptoms of&#xD;
        infection and disease depending on age and because transmission dynamics also vary by age.&#xD;
        Adolescents of 15 year and older will not be included as their symptom patterns resembles&#xD;
        more disease pathology of adults. Because of pragmatic and practical reasons we will&#xD;
        include primary school children from the 3rd grade (age 8-9) and secondary schoolchildren&#xD;
        from the 2nd grade (age 13-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study sample will be recruited in all Belgian schools including Brussels-Capital, and&#xD;
        the Flemish and Walloon Regions (including the German speaking community). School&#xD;
        attendance in this age group is high in Belgium, because of this, recruitment of school-age&#xD;
        children through schools is acceptable.&#xD;
