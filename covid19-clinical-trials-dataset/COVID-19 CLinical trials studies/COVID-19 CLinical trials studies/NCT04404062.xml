      Richmond Research Institute (RRI) is applying existing and new COVID-19 PCR and antibody&#xD;
      tests to help develop methodologies which provide fast and accurate results. Infection with&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a worldwide pandemic and reliable testing for COVID-19&#xD;
      is crucial to understand who is infected and therefore a risk to others by spreading the&#xD;
      infection. The tests that are currently being investigated by RRI include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The RAPG-COV-019 kit, a small testing cartridge developed by Biopanda Reagents which&#xD;
      detects whether an individual has been infected by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) by using a&#xD;
      spot of the person's blood and displays these results in 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. An already established laboratory test that detects SARS-CoV-2 by a process known as&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This test is accurate but expensive, time consuming and&#xD;
      requires highly trained staff and laboratory facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Development of a quantitative laboratory reference test for antibodies (IgG) against the&#xD;
      novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above tests are being used by RRI to follow infections (PCR) and immunity (IgG) in their&#xD;
      workforce, as well as their families and visitors to their site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAPG-COV-019 kit can be used by non-experts and provides results within minutes, and&#xD;
      would allow rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The results&#xD;
      will enable determination of whether the RAPG-COV-019 kit can make a reliable diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting this data also allows the gathering of epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      including incidence, prevalence and information on asymptomatic carriers. Furthermore,&#xD;
      identifying individuals that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 has great potential to improve&#xD;
      health outcomes by allowing infected individuals to seek the correct medical treatment as&#xD;
      well as self-isolate and reduce transmission.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The RAPG-COV-019 kit is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM&#xD;
      antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole blood, serum or plasma specimens. IgG and IgM detection&#xD;
      components are separate allowing for differential detection of each antibody. In the IgG&#xD;
      component, mouse anti-human IgG is immobilised on the IgG test line region. During testing,&#xD;
      the specimen reacts with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated particles in the test cassette. The&#xD;
      mixture then migrates laterally along the membrane by capillary action. If the specimen&#xD;
      contains IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, they react with the anti-human IgG in the IgG test&#xD;
      line region leading to the appearance of a coloured line in the IgG region of the test&#xD;
      cassette. Similarly, mouse anti-human IgM is immobilised in the IgM test line region and a&#xD;
      specimen containing IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will cause a coloured line to appear in the&#xD;
      IgM test line region. If the specimen contains neither SARS-CoV-2 IgG nor IgM, no coloured&#xD;
      line will appear in either of the test line regions. The test result can then be interpreted&#xD;
      as negative. A control line is included on the opposite side of the test cassette. If the&#xD;
      test has been conducted successfully, there will always be a colour change in this region&#xD;
      indicating that sufficient lateral flow of material occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a screening study to measure asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in trial&#xD;
      participants; to assess the number and speed at which trial participants were infected and&#xD;
      cleared the virus without symptoms; and to determine the length of symptom onset in those&#xD;
      with an active infection. This also creates an opportunity to determine the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the RAPG-COV-019 test kit to detect IgG/IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole&#xD;
      blood. In addition, this study aims to help facilitate the development a quantitative&#xD;
      laboratory reference test for antibodies (IgG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this date, 764 PCR tests and 973 antibody tests have been carried out in 424 individuals,&#xD;
      providing some interrim data. Of the 764 PCR tests, 634 (83.0%) were negative and 39 (5.1%)&#xD;
      were negative. Of the 973 antibody tests, 96 (9.9%) were positive for IgG only, 20 (2.1%)&#xD;
      were positive for IgM only, and 54 (5.5%) were positive for both IgG and IgM. 794 (81.6%)&#xD;
      tests were negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of those individuals with a positive PCR test, 53% reported fever during the previous two&#xD;
      months and 75% reported a loss of taste during the previous two months.&#xD;
