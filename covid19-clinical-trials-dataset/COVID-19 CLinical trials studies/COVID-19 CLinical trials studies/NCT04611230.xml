  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Lung failure is the main cause of death&#xD;
      related to COVID-19 infection. The main objective of this study is to assess infection of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and how quality of life is affected in adult volunteers in Lake County, Illinois.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be recruited through digital advertisements and participants will be required&#xD;
      to fill an online questionnaire. Upon consent, participants will be required to provide nasal&#xD;
      swab and blood sample. Approximately 1250 adult volunteers living or working in Lake County,&#xD;
      IL will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for approximately 9 months and will be required to provide&#xD;
      nasal swab and blood samples every 3 months and complete questionnaires every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      monitored by medical assessments, blood tests and questionnaires.&#xD;
