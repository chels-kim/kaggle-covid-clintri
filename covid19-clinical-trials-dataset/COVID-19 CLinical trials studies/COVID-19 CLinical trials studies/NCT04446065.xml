    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of Previfenon® (EGCG) to&#xD;
      prevent COVID-19, enhance systemic immunity, and decrease the frequency and intensity of&#xD;
      selected symptoms when used as pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Experimental studies have revealed that epigallocatechin-3-galeate (EGCG), a&#xD;
      biologically active polyphenol extracted and purified from Camellia Sinensis, may prevent&#xD;
      infection by various kinds of viruses, including coronaviruses. Recent double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials, reported up to 75% reduction in the risk of respiratory infection&#xD;
      by healthcare workers during an outbreak of H1N1 influenza, simultaneously enhancing systemic&#xD;
      immunity by increasing proliferation of ϒδ T cells (28%) and production of IFN-γ (26%). In&#xD;
      molecular docking studies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak also known as COVID-19)&#xD;
      EGCG was identified as a candidate with very high potential for antiviral chemoprophylaxis of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine whether Previfenon®, a proprietary formulation of EGCG ≥ 98%&#xD;
      purity stabilized with selected excipients, may clinically prevent COVID-19, enhance systemic&#xD;
      immunity, decrease the rate for acute respiratory disease, and reduce the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of selected symptoms of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To determine safety and tolerability of Previfenon® in terms of liver&#xD;
      toxicity and frequency of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of healthcare workers in&#xD;
      treatment by 40 consecutive days as minimum, or a maximum variable time between 60 to 70 days&#xD;
      during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Latin American hospitals exposed to clinical care, contact,&#xD;
      or circulation of patients with suspected respiratory acute disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 also&#xD;
      known as COVID -19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A minimum effect size of 25% (OR = 0.75) is considered; 5% alpha error; 90%&#xD;
      power; R = 0.25 for confounders and 20% for loss to follow up. If a conservative event rate&#xD;
      of 7.5% in the untreated group is considered, the trial will require 524 participants (262&#xD;
      each group); if the event rate reaches 13.5%, the trial will require 298 participants (149&#xD;
      each group). It is expected to recruit between 100 to 240 subjects per site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The treatment group will receive 3 capsules of Previfenon® daily containing 250&#xD;
      mg of EGCG one every 8 hours. The control group will receive 3 placebo capsules (starch 250&#xD;
      mg) under the same frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. The primary outcome will be the rate of clinically defined COVID-19 confirmed with&#xD;
      rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Secondary outcomes will be (1) rate of positive cases for&#xD;
      IgM or IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 as measured by a rapid immuno-chromatographic test; (2) rate of&#xD;
      positive cases for rtPCR for SARS-Cov-2 viral RNA (3) rate of hospitalization for acute&#xD;
      respiratory disease; (4) total rate of lower or upper acute respiratory disease. Exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes will be the frequency and intensity of selected symptoms for COVID-19. Safety&#xD;
      outcomes will be the number of events of major hepatic toxicity accounted by an increment in&#xD;
      liver enzymes and frequency of adverse events during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis. Comparison of frequencies, means, and proportions for all relevant variables&#xD;
      between treated group and placebo will be performed. An interim analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      with the first 366 subjects with at least 20 days of treatment during the outbreak. It will&#xD;
      be utilized logistic regression to explore the ongoing effect size in a fixed-effect model.&#xD;
      Disease-free person-days curves over the total follow up period will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier and the total effect size will be computed by Cox proportional hazards multiple&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leading hypothesis: The use of Previfenon® will have a high efficacy in the chemoprophylaxis&#xD;
      of COVID-19 through multiple complementary mechanisms, which ultimately prevent an efficient&#xD;
      incubation of the SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells, and simultaneously, enhances systemic&#xD;
      immunity against the pathogen.&#xD;
