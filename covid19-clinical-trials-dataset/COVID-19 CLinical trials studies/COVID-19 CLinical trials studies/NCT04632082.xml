      A pragmatic superiority randomized controlled trial comparing Telepsychoeducation plus&#xD;
      personalized videos vs. Telepsychoeducation without personalized videos for the prevention of&#xD;
      future emotional distress in professionals and students from essential services with low to&#xD;

      TITLE: &quot;A pragmatic superiority randomized controlled trial comparing Telepsychoeducation&#xD;
      plus personalized videos vs. Telepsychoeducation without personalized videos for the&#xD;
      prevention of future emotional distress in professionals and students from essential services&#xD;
      with low to moderate levels of emotional distress in Brazil&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 outbreak is associated with increased emotional distress (depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and irritability) all over the world. Currently, there are no large randomized trials&#xD;
      testing preventive interventions to reduce the burden caused by mental disorders after the&#xD;
      occurrence of a pandemic outbreak in these proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of Telepsychoeducation with personalized videos to&#xD;
      Telepsychoeducaton without personalized videos for the prevention of severe symptoms of&#xD;
      emotional distress (anxiety, depression and irritability) in health professionals with a low&#xD;
      to moderate level of those symptoms in Brazil during the COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-group randomized clinical trial. Participants were&#xD;
      recruited in Brazil from the national service of telehealth provided by the ministry of&#xD;
      health. Participants included health professionals suffering from low to moderate levels of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and irritability symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Low to moderate&#xD;
      levels of symptoms were defined by all of the following: (1) z score lower than 1.5 on the&#xD;
      PROMIS Anxiety Scale; (2) z score lower than 1.5 on the PROMIS Depression Scale; (3) z score&#xD;
      lower than 1.5 on the PROMIS Anger Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS: All participants were randomized to the Telepsychoeducation with personalized&#xD;
      videos (1 session with a psychologist plus 1 videos a week for 4 weeks, chosen based on&#xD;
      symptom presentation) or Telepsychoeducation without personalized videos (1 session with a&#xD;
      psychologist focused on reassurance and aspects of the outbreak).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants with a&#xD;
      T score equal or above 70 in any of the emotional distress scales (anxiety, depression or&#xD;
      irritability) in 6 months. Secondary outcomes (1) mean score change in individual scales at&#xD;
      1, 3 and 6 months; (2) proportion of participants with a T score equal or above 60 in any of&#xD;
      the emotional distress scales at 1, 3 and 6 months; and (3) service satisfaction and&#xD;
      net-promoter score at the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS: To detect a 5% group difference between each group, an alpha of 0.05, power&#xD;
      of 90% and 20% loss to follow up, in a 1:1 randomization, we would need a total of 1100&#xD;
      participants per group.&#xD;
