  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has adversely affected the healthcare system across the world. The world was not&#xD;
      prepared for global outbreak of infectious diseases. The rapid spread of severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is enabling researchers worldwide to acquire&#xD;
      a large amount of clinical data regarding coronavirus disease (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 infection severely affects the respiratory system in the critical cases and&#xD;
      results in mortalities. The affected people experience a dry cough, fever, breathing&#xD;
      problems, diarrhea, muscle pain, and sore throat. Besides that, some of the evidence from&#xD;
      Italy, South Korea, China, and Spain suggest that the COVID-19 cases also lose their senses&#xD;
      of smell and taste resulting in alterations in those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether COVID-19 cases have Olfactory&#xD;
      and gustatory dysfunctions as a hallmark indicator and can be used as diagnostic tools for&#xD;
      the isolation of suspected people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are presenting a prospective proportional case-control study that is conducted&#xD;
      to investigate the COVID-19 cases with anosmia and /or Ageusia in a university hospital in&#xD;
      Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sample size of this case series would be 250 cases of suspected&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. The cases included in the study are analyzed prospectively to determine if&#xD;
      the cases had a history of anosmia and /or Ageusia, and then tested for the alteration of&#xD;
      these senses through a panel of standardized odors/taste strips. That is looked at&#xD;
      statistically allowing us to confirm the proposed effectiveness of these tests as a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool.&#xD;

      Upon identification of the patient in the triage area the research assistant will start the&#xD;
      study by introducing the concept for the patient and then taking consent. The patient will go&#xD;
      through the regular flow of patients in the ED and after being asked to do the swabs the&#xD;
      research assistant will start the process of the study by testing the smell by the NHANES&#xD;
      cards then directly assess the taste by the NHANES strips and documents the results on the&#xD;
      cards and ask the patient to take a photo with his mobile and send it with his name to the&#xD;
      primary investigator via a mobile application and dedicated phone number. The research&#xD;
      assistant is the same person who is going to take the nasopharyngeal swab for the COVID-19&#xD;
      test. The cards are going to be collected in the negative pressure room of the patients and&#xD;
      then discarded in the same room. The investigators in the study are not aware of which&#xD;
      patient is answering what blinded investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taste exam measures in NHANES The NHANES chemosensory tests used regional and whole mouth&#xD;
      taste intensities of bitter and salt tastants as measures of taste function, which were&#xD;
      similar to those implemented in the NIH Toolbox norming study. These NHANES taste measures&#xD;
      were selected based on their ability to capture genetic and environmentally mediated&#xD;
      variation in taste and for their potential relevance to diet and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smell function in NHANES was assessed with an 8-item, odor identification test (Pocket Smell&#xD;
      Tests™, Sensonics, Inc., Haddon Heights, NJ). Of many available psychophysical measures of&#xD;
      olfactory function, odor identification tests are the most widely used in epidemiological and&#xD;
      clinical settings, as they are quick, relatively inexpensive, and easy to administer. The&#xD;
      odor identification test corresponds well with odor threshold tasks as well as other&#xD;
      suprathreshold olfactory measures (e.g., discrimination, odor intensity), and hence is&#xD;
      considered to be a rapid and accurate method for detecting olfactory dysfunction.&#xD;
