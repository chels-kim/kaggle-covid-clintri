    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Units (ICU) are stressful places where life-and-death medical decisions are&#xD;
      made and patients' surrogate decision-makers are exposed to potentially traumatic&#xD;
      experiences. As the number of life-prolonging procedures administered to the patient rises,&#xD;
      the patient's quality of life falls. Thus, interventions to improve the quality of life and&#xD;
      care of ICU patients are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMPOWER is a cognitive-behavioral, acceptance-based intervention for patient surrogate&#xD;
      decision-makers to reduce experiential avoidance of unpleasant thoughts and feelings related&#xD;
      to thinking about patient death. By reducing surrogate's experiential avoidance, EMPOWER&#xD;
      removes a barrier to advance care planning. EMPOWER aims to improve patient quality of life&#xD;
      through enhancing value-directed end-of-life care while also empowering surrogates to cope&#xD;
      with a loved one's potential impending death and adjust following the patient's ICU death or&#xD;
      discharge. Specifically, investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1: Develop EMPOWER for surrogate decision-makers of critically ill patients who are at&#xD;
           risk of becoming incapacitated or are currently unable to communicate in the ICU. Key&#xD;
           informants, including bereaved ICU patient caregivers and clinicians, will be asked to&#xD;
           evaluate the EMPOWER intervention manual to increase its potential tolerability,&#xD;
           acceptability and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: Determine feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, and preliminary effects of&#xD;
           EMPOWER on surrogate mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3: Estimate the effects of EMPOWER on patient outcomes in the months following the ICU&#xD;
           admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Surrogate decision-makers who receive EMPOWER will have significantly lower&#xD;
      levels of peritraumatic distress when compared to usual care condition at post intervention&#xD;
      assessment (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patients whose surrogates receive EMPOWER will have more value-concordant care,&#xD;
      better quality of life, and better quality of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMPOWER was first evaluated though a single site open trial (n=10). Feedback from clinicians,&#xD;
      bereaved stakeholders and results from the open trial were then used to refine the&#xD;
      intervention and launch a multi-center randomized controlled trial to examine clinical&#xD;
      superiority of EMPOWER to enhanced usual care. In order to adapt to restrictions in ICU&#xD;
      visitation and meet the needs of family caregivers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a&#xD;
      second single arm open trial is now occurring while the RCT recruitment is paused (total n of&#xD;
      RCT &amp; COVID-19 open trial=60).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive care in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has been shown to impair the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients with advanced cancer and to increase the risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) among the family and friends who serve as informal caregivers. Although ICU stays are&#xD;
      established indicators of low quality end-of-life (EoL) cancer care, a large, growing number&#xD;
      of cancer patients - over 1 in 4 -- are being admitted to the ICU in the last month of life.&#xD;
      Even within the ICU, investigators find that as the number of life-prolonging procedures&#xD;
      administered to the patient rises, the patient's quality of life falls. Thus, interventions&#xD;
      to reduce the suffering and to improve the quality of life and care of ICU cancer patients&#xD;
      are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, suffering is not confined to the patient. Informal caregivers of cancer&#xD;
      patients in the ICU also suffer. In our &quot;Severity of Suffering&quot; (SoS) study, which examined&#xD;
      dying cancer patients' quality of life in the ICU, nurses indicated that 53% of the patients'&#xD;
      caregivers were acutely distressed. The nurses also reported that 43% of the patient's&#xD;
      caregivers had unrealistic expectations for the patient's recovery and that 41% insisted that&#xD;
      the patient receive futile, burdensome care (e.g., resuscitation). Over 85% of these patients&#xD;
      were unable to communicate, which resulted in the need for grieving, potentially traumatized&#xD;
      caregivers to serve as the patient's surrogate decision-maker and make life-and-death&#xD;
      decisions for a critically ill, uncommunicative patient. Additionally, caregivers of patients&#xD;
      who die in the ICU are also at elevated risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the&#xD;
      months that follow the potentially traumatic ICU &quot;exposures&quot;. These findings indicate a&#xD;
      compelling need to address the varying mental health needs of informal caregivers and&#xD;
      surrogate decision-makers of patients in the ICU from admission to after discharge, as well&#xD;
      as to provide them with resources to clarify and inform the decision-making process regarding&#xD;
      care for patients who are unable to communicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these needs, we have developed and will refine and evaluate EMPOWER, a mental&#xD;
      health intervention for surrogate decision-makers of ICU patients who are at risk of becoming&#xD;
      incapacitated or are currently unable to make medical decisions. Delivered by a trained&#xD;
      mental health professional in the ICU setting, EMPOWER is a cognitive-behavioral,&#xD;
      acceptance-based intervention designed to reduce &quot;experiential avoidance&quot; of unpleasant&#xD;
      thoughts and feelings related to thinking about the patient's death and to provide active&#xD;
      strategies for coping with peritraumatic distress and anticipatory grief. Additionally, by&#xD;
      reducing surrogates' experiential avoidance, EMPOWER removes a barrier to advanced care&#xD;
      planning and promotes the receipt of EoL care consistent with patient values. In this way,&#xD;
      EMPOWER aims to facilitate EoL care that enhances patient quality of life while also&#xD;
      empowering surrogates to cope with a loved one's potential impending death and adjust&#xD;
      following the patient's ICU death or discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to obtain information on its feasibility, tolerability, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary effect size estimates to inform the planning of a larger, efficacy randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). The first 10 surrogate decision-makers were enrolled in an open trial&#xD;
      to receive EMPOWER. We then began a pilot RCT, randomizing surrogate decision-makers to&#xD;
      receive either EMPOWER or enhanced usual care using a block-randomization strategy to&#xD;
      determine condition assignment. In light of restrictions on recruitment and increased needs&#xD;
      of surrogates during the COVID-19 pandemic, the RCT portion of this trial has been paused and&#xD;
      we are now recruiting for a second open trial only administering EMPOWER. 60&#xD;
      surrogate-patient dyads will be enrolled between the RCT and COVID-19 open trial. Including&#xD;
      the first open trial, we will enroll a total of 70 surrogate decision-makers of 70 current&#xD;
      patients from the intensive care units at New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell, New York&#xD;
      Presbyterian-Queens, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Research staff will&#xD;
      regularly contact ICU physicians in person or by email and/or screen patient charts to&#xD;
      identify eligible candidates based on the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surrogates will be consented and screened. Those who score above 5 on either item measuring&#xD;
      anxiety in the McGill Quality of Life Scale, or with a summed score of at least 8 on the&#xD;
      first two items of the Partner Dependency Scale (PDS) will be randomized to receive EMPOWER&#xD;
      or usual care in the RCT, or solely assigned to receive the intervention in the pilot trials.&#xD;
      Surrogates will be assessed pre-intervention/baseline (Time point 1, T1), post-intervention&#xD;
      (within a week of the surrogate's completion of the baseline assessment) (Time point 2, T2),&#xD;
      1-month post-T2 (Time point 3, T3), and 3-months post-T2(Time point 4, T4). Surrogates will&#xD;
      be assigned to either control (usual care) or intervention group using block randomization in&#xD;
      the RCT, and solely to EMPOWER in open trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMPOWER is based on well-established cognitive-behavioral techniques that aim to promote the&#xD;
      expression and understanding of a person's emotional reactions. The EMPOWER interventionist&#xD;
      will be compassionate and attempt to teach subjects tools for remaining present-focused,&#xD;
      validate participants' experience, explore participants' loved ones' and participants' own&#xD;
      wishes, values and decision challenges, increase subjects acceptance and sense of permission&#xD;
      to experience challenging emotions, and prepare participants for future distressing&#xD;
      situations. Enhanced usual care will consist of a surrogate's interactions with social&#xD;
      support services in the ICU as documented in the patient's medical chart, referrals for&#xD;
      current site-specific resources for informal caregivers, and a packet providing general&#xD;
      information and tips on serving as an informal caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLM modeling will determine differences between surrogates and patients assigned to EMPOWER&#xD;
      vs. enhanced usual care. The primary outcome is post-intervention (T2) differences on a&#xD;
      measure of peritraumatic distress. Secondary outcomes are differences on measures of&#xD;
      prolonged grief disorder, PTSD and experiential avoidance at one-month (T3) and three-month&#xD;
      (T4) follow up from T2. Exploratory outcomes for surrogates are differences in reported&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety, depression, and decision regret at one-month (T3) and three-month (T4)&#xD;
      follow up from T2. Exploratory outcomes for patients are differences in surrogate-reported&#xD;
      quality of life, quality of death, and value concordant care. HLM models will include&#xD;
      covariates, either as fixed-effect or time-varying, if those variables are found to be&#xD;
      significantly statistically associated with both intervention assignment and the outcome&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a review of the open trial pilot data and stakeholder feedback to evaluate our&#xD;
      intervention targets, assessments and the primary outcome in the RCT were revised to target&#xD;
      the effects of the EMPOWER intervention on peri (rather than post) traumatic stress.&#xD;
