  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis was that physical activity program will be acceptable and may counteract&#xD;
      physical and mental decline among older adults hospitalized in covid-19 unit&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 30 second chair test, balance with joint-feet and semi-tandem stance, and 4 meters&#xD;
      comfortable walking test were evaluated. Depending on their score, a specific PA program was&#xD;
      selected and explained. The program was printed, explained and lefted in the room. This&#xD;
      intervention included 5 different PA programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final evaluation (one day before leaving the unit) recording physical performance (same&#xD;
      physical tests used for inclusion evaluation), HAD score, ADL and self-satisfaction of the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
