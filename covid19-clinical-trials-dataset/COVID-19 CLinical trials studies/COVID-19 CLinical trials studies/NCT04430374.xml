  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, that causes&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), is highly contagious in the community and has resulted&#xD;
      in a global pandemic. This infection has a special implication on the patient who complains&#xD;
      from cardiac disease or acute cardiovascular condition and may result in cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications such as myocardial infarction. For this end, we target to study this group of&#xD;
      patient, who has a cardiac disease with COVID-19 in Qatar, in addition, the acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction with COVID-19 from the Gulf countries and collect all the related data to come&#xD;
      with a comprehensive view about those patients.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this registry is to create a database of patients who present with&#xD;
      acute cardiovascular and are found to be COVID -19 positive (by PCR). The registry will&#xD;
      consist of four arms (1) Retrospective data for all patients since the COVID-19 appear in&#xD;
      Qatar unit the date of submission the protocol (2) Prospective data starting from the date of&#xD;
      submission of this protocol and forward until end of December 2020 (3) Retrospective data for&#xD;
      all cardiac patients hospitalizations in the COVID period of this year 2020 will be compared&#xD;
      to previous years to report the trends of acute cardiovascular conditions in the COVID era to&#xD;
      previous data, as a lot of countries documented decrease in the incidence. (4) retrospective&#xD;
      data for acute MI and found to be COVID-19 until this protocol amendment from participating&#xD;
      hospitals in the Gulf region to be compared with Acute MI from Qatar who collected in arm 1.&#xD;
      The registry will consist of patients admitted with AMI who were already having active&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection or were incidentally found to have COVID-19 by PCR. Additionally,&#xD;
      prospective data from the data of this protocol amendment until the end of December 2020.&#xD;
      This arm target to (a) increases the number of the collected patient for Acute MI with&#xD;
      COVID-19category due to the small number in Qatar alone. (b) give the opportunity for Qatar&#xD;
      to lead a multicenter project to serve in a hot topic, in particular, the data collection and&#xD;
      analysis will be in Qatar. (c) allow releasing a publication for one cardiovascular center&#xD;
      (Qatar only) and multi-cardiovascular center (all the Gulf), a multi-center publication about&#xD;
      this issue could be rare on the worldwide level, and finally, (d) to increase the accuracy of&#xD;
      the data analysis due to larger data size and comparing more than one site together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary plan to compare our patients' populations and outcomes with that of other&#xD;
      international registries such as the NACMI(US registry). The NACMI registry is a rapid&#xD;
      collaboration of multinational societies and medical institutions with a pragmatic study&#xD;
      design to encourage widespread participation that will enable the development of data-driven&#xD;
      guidelines and therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be patients with confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection with the acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditions at the time of presentation to the hospital or that developed while&#xD;
      in the hospital. All the history, laboratory results, current admission data, medication,&#xD;
      angiogram, or intervention procedure (if underwent), and any other relevant data will be&#xD;
      collected. All the patients who are applicable for this registry and meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be involved so the final number of the subject is not specified. All patients&#xD;
      with the acute coronary syndrome, out of hospital cardiac arrest and arrhythmias who are&#xD;
      found to be COVID positive and required hospitalization will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data variables will be collected as covariates of interest: baseline&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and pattern of ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation (diffuse, focal, with or without ST-segment depression and/or PR -segment&#xD;
      depression) transthoracic echocardiography or point-of-care ultrasound findings, commonly&#xD;
      used time to treatment metrics in STEMI care (door -to -balloon or door -to -needle times),&#xD;
      angiographic characteristics, and adjunctive pharmacological and device therapies including&#xD;
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications for COVID -19 positive patients Observational registries have gained traction in&#xD;
      cardiovascular medicine as they provide important information, including benefits and&#xD;
      potential complications of different treatments or procedures. [12] For example, consecutive&#xD;
      enrollment of patients with well -defined entry criteria in the Chest pain -MI Registry has&#xD;
      been a reliable source for outcome-based, a quality improvement on high -risk STEMI/NSTEMI&#xD;
      patients. [13] Immediate access to actionable data is particularly relevant to the current&#xD;
      expanding COVID -19 pandemic which is disproportionally affecting cardiovascular patients and&#xD;
      healthcare workers. [14] At present, there is no data-driven consensus on the management of&#xD;
      patients with confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection who present with ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation on ECG. [11,15,16] The NACMI registry will be beneficial in identifying etiology,&#xD;
      patterns of myocardial injury, developing a risk model for cardiac complications,&#xD;
      understanding short and long -term major adverse cardiac events, and designing clinical&#xD;
      trials testing different treatment modalities. Therefore, the registry will include both&#xD;
      COVID -19 positive patients and PUI with acute cardiovascular conditions. A comparison of PUI&#xD;
      subsequently confirmed positive to those subsequently confirmed negative will provide a&#xD;
      unique insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism of STEMI from COVID -19, including&#xD;
      myocarditis and prothrombotic states. Comparison of patients enrolled in NACMI to&#xD;
      propensity-matched non -COVID STEMI controls for 1 year prior will provide critical&#xD;
      information regarding etiology, treatment strategies and clinical outcomes in the COVID -19&#xD;
      pandemic. As testing for COVID -19 becomes more rapid, this decision -making process is&#xD;
      expected to evolve. Additionally, it has been reported that overall STEMI volumes have&#xD;
      decreased in the COVID -19 era, without a clear understanding of the reasons. [17,18] It may&#xD;
      be that patients are delaying their presentation to the hospital, potentially leading to the&#xD;
      need for mechanical circulatory support in the acute setting, mechanical complications of&#xD;
      STEMI, sudden death or an increased heart failure population. Additionally, if patients are&#xD;
      presenting later in their clinical course, NACMI registry data will allow practitioners to&#xD;
      improve care models to improve time to treatment in this unique era.&#xD;
