      SAINT-PERU is a triple-blind, randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of ivermectin versus placebo to obtain negative PCR results in patients with&#xD;
      early phase COVID-19. The trial is currently planned at a single center in Lima.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SAINT is a triple-blind, randomized phase 2a controlled trial with two parallel groups to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in reducing nasal viral carriage at seven days after&#xD;
      treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients regardless of the presence of risk of progression&#xD;
      to severe disease. This study will take place in the Hospital Cayetano Heredia, in Lima.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 68 patients (34 per group). Selected patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one (1) daily dose of 300 mcg/kg ivermectin or an equivalent placebo during three (3)&#xD;
      consecutive days . The randomization code will be generated by the trial statistician using&#xD;
      blocks of four that ensure balance between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation will be made by the investigator after obtaining informed consent, and&#xD;
      confirmation of fulfillment of all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      investigational product will be administered by a trial pharmacist not involved in patient&#xD;
      care or participant follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will remain in the trial for a period of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the interests of public health and containing transmission of infection, trial visits will&#xD;
      be conducted in the participant's home by a clinical trial team comprising medical members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent visits will be to assess clinical and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final study call will be made for participants who withdraw prematurely from the study or&#xD;
      are withdrawn by the investigator. In such call, investigator will give instructions for the&#xD;
      destruction of the investigational product, and will inform about their clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory results.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>SAINT-PERI is a triple-blind, randomized phase 2a controlled trial with two parallel groups to evaluate the efficacy of one (1) daily dose of ivermectin during three (3) consecutive days, administered to non-severe COVID-19 patients in the first 96 hours after symptoms onset, to reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab at day seven post-treatment. The efficacy of the drug-based strategy to reduce or block transmission involves treating during early phases of infection, when viral replication is yet limited</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The Ivermectin presentation will be an oral drop solution in a flasks containing 5ml. The placebo presentation will also be an oral drop solution, undistinguishable from ivermectin, but without this device pharmaceutical ingredient. The pharmacist will prepare the treatment flasks (three 5ml flasks per participant), labelling them according to the randomization list in blocks of four (a, b) previously prepared by the epidemiologist, and according to the randomized treatment allocation previously notified by the principal investigator. The participant, investigator and outcomes assessor will be blinded to the study intervention.</masking_description>
