    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether bamlanivimab is able to stop COVID-19 from&#xD;
      getting worse. Participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 will receive bamlanivimab via an&#xD;
      injection into a vein. These participants will be matched to similar COVID-19 patients who&#xD;
      received other treatment at a local medical center. All participants will be followed to&#xD;
      learn how their disease responds. Participation could last about 3 months and includes two&#xD;
      required visits to the study site, with the remainder of assessments performed by phone or by&#xD;
      medical record review.&#xD;
