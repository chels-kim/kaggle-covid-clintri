  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In community acquired pneumonia, corticosteroids have been shown to have potential benefit.&#xD;
      However, the limited and variable use of adjunctive corticosteroids in critically ill&#xD;
      patients is largely due to an inability to identify patients that will benefit from the use&#xD;
      of anti-inflammatory medications. This study compares usual care to a novel&#xD;
      biomarker-tailored steroid dosing algorithm for patients with community acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In April 2020, in response to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, we added a COVID-19 arm to this study.&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the role of biomarker-titrated adjuvant corticosteroid administration&#xD;
      compared to usual care in patients admitted to hospital with SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection&#xD;
      and acute respiratory failure.&#xD;

      This is a two-arm single-center pilot phase II clinical trial. Patients will be screened at&#xD;
      the time of hospital admission and will be required to be enrolled within the clinical trial&#xD;
      within 48 hours of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the individualized, biomarker-concordant arm, all patients will receive steroids once at&#xD;
      the time of admission, then a daily morning dose. In order to account for varying turnaround&#xD;
      time at different laboratories, CRP levels will be drawn with early morning labs, and used to&#xD;
      determine the steroid dosing for the day. Patients will receive daily CRP measurements for&#xD;
      the first 5 days of the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge. CRP measurements will&#xD;
      be discontinued once the CRP is less than 50mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroid administration will be facilitated using standardized computerized physician order&#xD;
      entry. The patients, treating physicians and outcome assessors will be blinded to the group&#xD;
      assignment. Steroid order sets will include 6 hourly point of care glucose monitoring, and an&#xD;
      insulin sliding scale for glucose levels to facilitate glucose management. The need for&#xD;
      insulin drip will be determined by the treating physician. Additional testing including serum&#xD;
      and urine ketones will be informed by the glucose level, serum anion gap and bicarbonate&#xD;
      levels in routine basic metabolic panels and determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the usual care arm, patients will receive daily CRP measurements for the first 5 days of&#xD;
      the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Progression of disease is defined by the need for high flow nasal cannula oxygen, noninvasive or invasive ventilation. Given the proliferation of high flow nasal cannula oxygen use in lieu of mechanical ventilation, instead of ventilator-free days the investigators opt for using advanced respiratory support free days where &quot;advanced respiratory support&quot; includes both invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation and the high flow nasal cannula oxygen.</description>
