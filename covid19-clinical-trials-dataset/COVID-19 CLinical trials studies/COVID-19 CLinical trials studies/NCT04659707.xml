      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pulmonary function of patients recovering from mild,&#xD;
      moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease using hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, the disease at the heart of the current global pandemic, is characterized by&#xD;
      fevers, cough, sore throat, malaise, and myalgias, with 98% of patients experiencing some&#xD;
      pulmonary involvement. In those infected with the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, the severity&#xD;
      of symptoms, as well as their duration, is widely variable. There is strong evidence from&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) images of patients with severe COVID-19 that pulmonary abnormalities&#xD;
      and lung damage caused by infection may have long-term consequences for survivors.&#xD;
      Furthermore, many patients with mild or moderate experience symptoms such as fatigue and&#xD;
      dyspnea long (&gt;60 days) after initial symptom onset, but there are currently no clinical&#xD;
      predictors of which patients are at greatest risk for long-term health effects. As such,&#xD;
      sensitive and specific predictors or biomarkers that can evaluate quality-of-life, risk of&#xD;
      infection exacerbation, and long-term outcomes are critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary imaging using hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a&#xD;
      means to detect abnormalities in the pulmonary small airways, vasculature, and parenchyma by&#xD;
      quantifying pulmonary ventilation, gas diffusion, and regional gas exchange. HP 129Xe MRI is&#xD;
      fast (&lt;16s), non-invasive, and radiation free, making it a safe and effective method for&#xD;
      characterizing lung function, even in individuals with lung disease. In this pilot study, we&#xD;
      will use HP 129Xe to evaluate pulmonary structure and function in COVID-19 patients using the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Detect regional pulmonary function abnormalities in recovering COVID-19 patients using&#xD;
      hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI. The hypothesis is that ventilation and gas exchange defects will be&#xD;
      present in recovering COVID-19 patients, and further that the extent of impairment will&#xD;
      correlate with disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine risk factors for long term outcomes using hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI and&#xD;
      clinical biomarkers. The hypothesis is that HP 129Xe MRI biomarkers will predict long-term&#xD;
      lung function impairment brought on by COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will be tested by performing HP 129Xe MRI in patients recovering from mild,&#xD;
      moderate, or severe COVID-19. By coming to a fuller understanding of the long-term impairment&#xD;
      of pulmonary function, future treatment can be optimized to minimize severe disease and&#xD;
      health care utilization.&#xD;
