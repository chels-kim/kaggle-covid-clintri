      In this multicenter study; it was aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      ivermectin use in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia that have no&#xD;
      mutations which alter ivermectin metabolism and cause side effects.&#xD;

      Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Two groups, the study&#xD;
      group and the control group, took part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg/day for five days (9 mg between 36-50 kg, 12 mg between 51-65 kg, 15 mg&#xD;
      between 66-79 kg and 200 microgram/kg in &gt; 80 kg) in the form of a solution prepared for&#xD;
      enteral use added to the reference treatment protocol -hydroxychloroquine (2x400mg loading&#xD;
      dose followed by 2x200mg, po, 5 days) + favipiravir (2x1600mg loading dose followed by&#xD;
      2x600mg maintenance dose, po, total 5 days) + azithromycin (first day 500mg followed by 4&#xD;
      days 250mg/day, po, total 5 days)- of patients included in the study group. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group were given only reference treatment with 3 other drugs without ivermectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mutations in 29 pairs of primers in mdr1/abcab1 gene by sequencing analysis using Sanger&#xD;
      method, and the haplotypes and mutations of the CYP3A4 gene that cause the function losing&#xD;
      were investigated among the patients who meet criteria and who were included in the study&#xD;
      group according to randomization. Mutation screening was done when the first dose of the&#xD;
      research drug ivermectin was given, ivermectin treatment was not continued in patients with&#xD;
      mutations detected as a result of genetic examination and these patients were excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed for 5 additional days after treatment. At the end of the treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up period (At the end of 10th day), clinical response and changes in oxygenation and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters were evaluated.&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>At the beginning of the study, it was planned to have 30 patients each in the control and study groups. During the study, 6 patients were excluded from the study group because ivermectin treatments were terminated due to the detection of mutations that impairs ivermectin metabolism and new patients were added. As a result, 66 patients were included in the study, 6 patients were excluded due to mutation detection and the study was completed with 30 patients in both groups.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Changes in the Ratio of Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte Count to Lymphocyte Count (PNL/L)</title>
          <description>Baseline PNL/L ratio of the patients were recorded in both groups. Then, their treatments were started and PNL/L ratios at the end of the 1st (TD1), 3rd (TD3) and 5th days (TD5) were also recorded. The end of the 5th day was accepted as the primary endpoint. While the change in PNL/L ratios on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days after the basal level was calculated graphically, the change in the PNL/L ratio at the end of the 5th day (primary endpoint) with the baseline ratio was compared statistically (the results were given as p value).</description>

        <title>Genetic Examination of Haplotypes and Mutations That Cause Function Losing for Ivermectin Metabolism</title>
        <description>A blood sample was taken from the patients included in the study group, after taking or during the first dose of ivermectin. From the blood samples, haplotypes and mutations that cause the function losing were investigated by performing sequence analysis of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/ABCB1 and CYP3A4 genes with Sanger method. In case of detection of mutation, the patient were excluded from the study and if observed, side effects of ivermectin were noted.</description>

        <population>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness/safety of adding ivermectin to the COVID-19 treatment in patients without mutation. Since ivermectin was not given to the control group, no blood sample was taken from these patients for mutation screening. The reason why there are 36 patients in the study group in this table is to indicate that there are 6 patients who were included in the study group but were removed from the study group because of a mutation and were replaced by additional patients.</population>

          <population>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness/safety of adding ivermectin to the COVID-19 treatment in patients without mutation. Since ivermectin was not given to the control group, no blood sample was taken from these patients for mutation screening. The reason why there are 36 patients in the study group in this table is to indicate that there are 6 patients who were included in the study group but were removed from the study group because of a mutation and were replaced by additional patients.</population>

        <title>Changes in the Ratio of Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PaO2) to Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2)</title>
        <description>In both groups, after the treatment period was completed (first 5 days, primary endpoint), patients were followed up for 5 more days (follow-up period). PaO2/FiO2 ratios at the end of 6th (FD1), 8th (FD3) and 10th day (FD5) were also recorded. The end of the 10th day was accepted as the secondary endpoint. While the change in PaO2/FiO2 ratios on the 6th, 8th and 10th days was calculated graphically, the change in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the end of the 10th day (secondary endpoint) with the baseline ratio was compared statistically (the results were given as p value).</description>

        <title>Changes in Serum Ferritin Levels</title>
        <description>In both groups, after the treatment period was completed (first 5 days, primary endpoint), patients were followed up for 5 more days (follow-up period). Serum ferritin levels (mg/dL) at the end of 6th (FD1), 8th (FD3) and 10th day (FD5) were also recorded. The end of the 10th day was accepted as the secondary endpoint. While the change in serum ferritin levels on the 6th, 8th and 10th days was calculated graphically, the change in the serum ferritin level at the end of the 10th day (secondary endpoint) with the baseline value was compared statistically (the results were given as p value).</description>

      <desc>In our study, it was also aimed to detect mutations that impair ivermectin metabolism and report side effects that may occur due to these mutations, and these mutations were detected in 6 patients initially included in the study group. Since these patients were excluded from the study on the first day following the mutation detection and their ivermectin treatment was discontinued, they were evaluated separately from the other patients included in the study.</desc>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>Patients who were hospitalised with a pre-diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and thereafter diagnosis of COVID-19 was also confirmed microbiologically with PCR positivity in respiratory tract samples were included into the study. They were randomized to the control and study group, respectively. Hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and azithromycin (HFA) standard treatment protocol were given to the control group as recommended in the &quot;COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Infection) Guide&quot; prepared by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health.</description>

          <title>Study Group</title>
          <description>In addition to HFA treatment, ivermectin 200 micrograms/kg/day (9mg between 36-50 kg, 12mg between 51-65 kg, 15mg between 66-79 kg and 200 micrograms/kg in &gt; 80 kg) in the form of a solution prepared for enteral use was added (HFA+I) to the treatment protocol of the study group's for five days. Blood sample was taken with the first dose of ivermectin and haplotype analysis was performed in ABCB1 and CYP3A4 genes in the whole study group.&#xD;
Ivermectin: Ivermectin 5mg/5ml solution was manufactured by NEUTEC™ Pharmaceutical Company-Turkey, under &quot;Good Manufacturing Practices&quot; (GMP) certification conditions.</description>
