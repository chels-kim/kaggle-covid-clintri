      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused mass&#xD;
      mortality in the last 3 months that necessitates urgent development of new therapeutical&#xD;
      agents. So far there is no effective anti-viral drug to reduce viral load that has critical&#xD;
      importance to prevent progress into severe viral pneumonia and systemic hyper inflammation&#xD;
      state. This project is to offer a biologic agent based on T cell derived exosomes. This is a&#xD;
      novel approach using our proprietary protocols for drug development. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      to test the safety and efficacy of this new agent following targeted delivery by metered dose&#xD;
      inhaler. The project have received proper approvals from the Turkish Ministry of Health and&#xD;
      Erciyes University, Kayseri Turkey. Turk-Patent Application Number: PCT/TR2020/050302&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 disease due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions people and caused thousands of mortality in the world over&#xD;
      the last 3 months. Clinically, COVID-19 presents with a wide range of disease severity&#xD;
      ranging from asymptomatic or very mild flu-like symptoms to very severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome and multi-organ failure. The severity of COVID-19 correlates with escalating levels&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation that eventually leads to hyperinflammatory stage resembling&#xD;
      macrophage activation syndrome and death. Therefore, early intervention is essential to&#xD;
      prevent progress into respiratory failure that requires reduction of viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) are body's natural immune defense against various&#xD;
      disease-causing viruses. Donor originated COVID-19 specific T-cells (CSTC) are in vitro&#xD;
      activated and expanded by exposing to viral peptide fragments in the presence of natural&#xD;
      immune stimulant proteins called cytokines. These COVID-19 specific fragment peptides&#xD;
      activate specific T-cells and stimulate the secretion of potent mediators including IFN gamma&#xD;
      in forms of exosomes. We propose treatment of COVID-19 patients -who are at early stages of&#xD;
      pulmonary disease- with CSTC-exomes to control disease progression. This biological agent&#xD;
      offers universal application without a need for HLA match. Furthermore, exosomes are suitable&#xD;
      as &quot;off the shelf product&quot; that allows dose titration for personalized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this single arm open labeled, combined interventional (phase I/II trials)&#xD;
      clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficiency of inhaled CSTC-exomes in the&#xD;
      treatment of early stage novel coronavirus (NCV) pneumonia.&#xD;
