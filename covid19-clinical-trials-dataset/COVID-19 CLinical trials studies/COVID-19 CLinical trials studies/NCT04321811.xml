  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic there is urgent need for information about&#xD;
      the natural history of the infection in non-hospitalized patients, including the severity and&#xD;
      duration of symptoms, and outcome from early in the infection, among different subgroups of&#xD;
      patients. In addition, a large, real-world data registry can provide information about how&#xD;
      different concomitant medications may differentially affect symptoms among patient subgroups.&#xD;
      Such information can be invaluable for clinicians managing chronic diseases during this&#xD;
      pandemic, as well as identify interventions undertaken in a naturalistic setting that have&#xD;
      differential effects. Such factors may include patient diet, over the counter or prescription&#xD;
      medications, and herbal and alternative treatments, among others. Identifying the natural&#xD;
      disease history in patients from different demographic and disease subgroups will be&#xD;
      important for identifying at-risk patients and effectiveness of interventions undertaken in&#xD;
      the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to understand at the population level the&#xD;
      symptomatic course of known or suspected COVID-19 patients while sheltering-in-place or under&#xD;
      quarantine. Symptoms will be measured using a daily report derived from the CTCAE-PRO as well&#xD;
      as free response. Outcomes will be assessed based on the duration and severity of infection,&#xD;
      hospitalization, lost-to-follow-up, or death. As a patient-centric registry, patients&#xD;
      themselves may propose, suggest, and/or submit evidence or ideas for relevant collection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will be registered for through the study Web site. Following Web site registration,&#xD;
      patients will receive an electronic informed consent form. Informed consent is a process that&#xD;
      is initiated prior to the individual's agreeing to participate in the study and continues&#xD;
      throughout the individual's study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB)-approved and the participant will read and review the document electronically.&#xD;
      Participants must sign the informed consent document prior to participating in the registry.&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time, without prejudice by emailing the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a real-world data registry, any adult men and women currently in the United States and&#xD;
      willing to provide written informed consent and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who are feeling sick but have not tested positive for COVID-19, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who are feeling sick and have tested positive for COVID-19, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who are not feeling sick but want to participate can enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients unwilling or unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT A registry database will be maintained with identified registry data elements&#xD;
      captured into the REDCap Cloud EDC system, a commercial eClinical Platform that is 21 CFR&#xD;
      Part 11 Validated, HIPAA &amp; FISMA compliant, and WHODrug and MedDRA certified. All access and&#xD;
      activity in the system is tracked and can easily be monitored by the Administrator. The&#xD;
      system has a login audit feature that tracks who has logged into the system, the date and&#xD;
      time of login, and the IP address of the connection. The system also tracks failed logins and&#xD;
      automatically locks a user's account after several failed attempts. The REDCap Cloud system&#xD;
      has a robust audit trail that shows all changes to any records within the system including&#xD;
      who made the change, the date and time of the change, the field that was changed, the old&#xD;
      value of the field and the new value of the field. Access can be monitored via a dashboard or&#xD;
      email alerts. Data management activities will follow standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RECORDS RETENTION In the event that patient authorize the collection of additional&#xD;
      medical records, those records will be maintained in xCures' HIPAA compliant box storage&#xD;
      platform hosted on Amazon's HIPAA-compliant cloud servers. Source information, including&#xD;
      medical records will be abstracted into a study database and not made available in their&#xD;
      original format outside the study team. Study data including source records and case reports&#xD;
      forms will be maintained in electronic format indefinitely. De-identified databases derived&#xD;
      from the study records may be made available to other researchers and may be retained by&#xD;
      those organizations indefinitely based on the terms of the agreement under which the data was&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCE DOCUMENTS Source data can include clinical findings and observations, or other&#xD;
      information incorporated into the registry database to support analysis of data. Source data&#xD;
      is all information from which information in the registry database is derived in original&#xD;
      form (or certified copies of an original record). Examples of these original documents and&#xD;
      records include but are not limited to the following: electronic medical records, clinical&#xD;
      and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, correspondence, subjects' diaries or&#xD;
      patient-reported questionnaires, data from automated instruments, such as ECG machines,&#xD;
      photographs and other imaging (DICOM) files, slides, pharmacy records, and the reports&#xD;
      documenting medical interpretation of those files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data may be entered into the eCRF either manually by the study team performing data&#xD;
      abstraction from the EMR or electronically using direct entry of data into the or from an&#xD;
      electronic import of data. Patients may also enter information directly into the eCRF using a&#xD;
      patient-facing survey functionality either over the Web or using a smartphone app. Data&#xD;
      elements originating in EMR may be automatically transmitted directly into the eCRF using a&#xD;
      suitable API. Source data derived in that manner may have an intervening process, such as&#xD;
      abstraction by third-party including software including processing using machine learning&#xD;
      algorithms prior to transferring to the eCRF. xCures will retain source records in a secure&#xD;
      that will be maintained separately and securely from the eCRF. However, metadata tagging may&#xD;
      be employed to electronically map source data back from the eCRF to the source data record to&#xD;
      create an audit trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCONTINUATION OF PARTICIPATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can withdraw from the registry at any time by sending a written request to&#xD;
      xCures. Withdrawal from the study means that no additional data will be collected from the&#xD;
      patient and does not constitute revocation of the right to use the data collected prior to&#xD;
      withdrawal for the purposes described herein. xCures may discontinue the study at any time&#xD;
      for any reason. In the event the registry is discontinued enrolled participants may receive&#xD;
      an email notification and a public posting on the study Web site will be made, if possible.&#xD;
