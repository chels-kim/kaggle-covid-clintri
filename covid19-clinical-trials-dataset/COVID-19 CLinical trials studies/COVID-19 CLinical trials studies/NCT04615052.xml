  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physical inactivity promoted by the patient's hospitalization, including those infected&#xD;
      with the coronavirus, can lead to an important health impairment, including atrophy and loss&#xD;
      of muscle function. Thus, a prospective study will be conducted to assess the effect of a&#xD;
      home-based exercise training program on health outcomes and quality of life in COVID-19&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
