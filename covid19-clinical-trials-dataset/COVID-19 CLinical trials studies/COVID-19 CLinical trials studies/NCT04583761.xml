      The purpose of this case-control study is to assess the association of the current and former&#xD;
      consumption of tobacco and nicotine in the risk of acquisition of severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). the investigators will send a structured interview by mail regarding&#xD;
      use of tobacco and nicotine to 2500 healthcare workers (1250 cases with a positive Real Time&#xD;
      Polymorphism Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and 1250 controls with a negative PCR) who were tested&#xD;
      in Paris for in March and April, 2020. OR will be estimated by conditional logistic&#xD;
      regression modelling with matching for sex and age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The negative impact of tobacco use on lung health is widely recognized, together with poorer&#xD;
      response to several infections. Smoking behaviour is characterized by inhalation and&#xD;
      repetitive hand-to-mouth movements which could contribute to virus acquisition. In the&#xD;
      context of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, smoking appears to be associated with negative progression&#xD;
      and adverse outcomes. On the other hand, several epidemiological studies suggest that the&#xD;
      risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower (OR 0.3) among current smokers, and&#xD;
      this negative association remains significant after adjustment for age or occupation. An&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the expression of the gene encoding for angiotensin II conversion&#xD;
      enzyme-2-receptor could be down-regulated by nicotin. However several bias in these&#xD;
      retrospective epidemiological studies limit their strength. Few informations are available&#xD;
      among former smokers and users of alternative nicotine delivery systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2020, at Hotel Dieu Hospital in Paris the investigators opened a center for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 screening, with nasopharyngeal swabs and RT-PCR, for healthcare workers who had&#xD;
      symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. fever, chills, headaches, dry cough, anosmia,&#xD;
      ageusia, diarrhea). No severe cases were tested. So far, more than 8000 healthcare workers&#xD;
      had been tested, among which 40% were positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform a case-control study in healthcare workers who underwent&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, in which cases are infected with a positive RT-PCR and controls are&#xD;
      negative. Cases and controls will be matched for sex and age. In order to obtain with &gt; 80%&#xD;
      probability an OR &lt; 0.6, the investigators estimated that the number of subjects to be&#xD;
      included is 1250 cases and 1250 controls. A structured questionnaire assessing current and&#xD;
      former tobacco consumption and alternative nicotine delivery systems will be sent by mail to&#xD;
      cases and controls. Informed consent will be obtained by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR will be estimated by conditional logistic regression modelling with matching for sex and&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a case-control study will elicit relevant information about the role of tobacco and&#xD;
      nicotine use in the risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
