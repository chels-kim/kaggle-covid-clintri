  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality of severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) has not declined over time and is&#xD;
      between 25 and 30% in sub-groups of patients. Corticosteroids (CTx) could down-regulate&#xD;
      pulmonary and systemic inflammation, accelerate clinical resolution and decrease the rate of&#xD;
      inflammation-associated systemic complications. Two recent meta-analyses suggest a positive&#xD;
      effect on severe CAP day 28 survival when CTx are added to standard therapy. However they are&#xD;
      based on only four trials gathering less than 300 patients, of which only one was positive.&#xD;
      Recently published guidelines do not recommend CTx as part of CAP treatment. Therefore a&#xD;
      well-powered trial appears necessary to test the hypothesis that CTx - and more specifically&#xD;
      hydrocortisone - could improve day 28 survival of critically-ill patients with severe CAP,&#xD;
      severity being assessed either on a Pulmonary Severity Index ≥ 130 (Fine class V) or by the&#xD;
      use of mechanical ventilation or high-FiO2 high-flow oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase-III multicenter add-on randomized controlled double-blind superiority trial assessing&#xD;
      the efficacy of hydrocortisone vs. placebo on Day 28 all-causes mortality, in addition to&#xD;
      antibiotics and supportive care, including the correction of hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified on: (i) centers; (ii) use of mechanical ventilation at the&#xD;
      time of inclusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive state-of-the-art standard therapy for severe Community-Acquired&#xD;
      Pneumonia (CAP), including antibiotics and supportive care. Correction of hypoxemia will use&#xD;
      standard low-flow oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive-ventilation or&#xD;
      invasive ventilation with endotracheal tube, as required. Patients in the treatment group&#xD;
      will receive intra-venous hydrocortisone. Patients of the control group will receive an&#xD;
      intravenous placebo by intravenous route at the same frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrocortisone or placebo will be given in a double-blind fashion for 8 or 14 full days. The&#xD;
      intravenous route will be used. The treatment course will include 4 or 7 days of full dose&#xD;
      (200 mg/day by continuous infusion), 2 or 4 days of half dose (100 mg/day by continuous&#xD;
      infusion), and 2 or 3 days of tapering dose (50 mg/day by continuous infusion). Duration of&#xD;
      treatment is chosen upon patient initial improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial amendment to the CAPE COD study has been submitted to the Competent Authorities&#xD;
      in order to conduct a specific analysis on the sub-group of patients included with COVID19&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease 2019), in order to get a quick response in this specific population and&#xD;
      in the context of an epidemic emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to answer as quickly as possible a therapeutic question of major importance in the&#xD;
      treatment of severe respiratory infections with CoV-2 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2). Modifications made to the original study for patients with COVID (coronavirus&#xD;
      disease) include some inclusion criteria, the primary endpoint, and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
