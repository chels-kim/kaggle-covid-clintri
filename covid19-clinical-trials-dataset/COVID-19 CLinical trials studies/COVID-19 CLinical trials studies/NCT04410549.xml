      To evaluate by intravascular OCT study the presence of microvascular pulmonary thrombosis in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19, high D-dimer levels and contrast CT scan negative for pulmonary&#xD;
      thrombosis. We'll also evaluate the extension of microvascular pulmonary thrombosis in&#xD;
      patients with contrast CT scan positive for pulmonary embolism in areas where contrast CT&#xD;
      scan was negative.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infection represents&#xD;
      a pandemic emergency of dramatic proportions. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      often meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with progressive&#xD;
      severity ultimately leading to a rapid death. It appeared that the progressive worsening lung&#xD;
      function of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was potentially driven by host immune response.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells causes direct cellular damage and release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory alarmins from dying cells. The successive complement system activation&#xD;
      causes massive local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and consequent severe collateral&#xD;
      tissue injury and massive vascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial cell damage and&#xD;
      microvascular thrombosis. Functional implications of this peculiar ARDS pathogenesis include&#xD;
      a progressive worsening of ventilation/perfusion imbalances and a loss of hypoxic&#xD;
      vasoconstriction reflexes, with a marked component of microvascular pulmonary thrombosis, as&#xD;
      suggested by lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer elevations. In the late stages of ARDS, the&#xD;
      progression of endothelial damage with microvascular thrombosis can spread locally in the&#xD;
      lung and potentially extends the systemic inflammatory reaction involving the microvascular&#xD;
      bed of the kidneys, brain and other vital organs. A new mechanism of lung damage was recently&#xD;
      proposed, with dramatic alveolar endothelial damage leading to a progressive endothelial&#xD;
      pulmonary syndrome with microvascular thrombosis and suggests MicroCLOTS (microvascular&#xD;
      COVID-19 lung vessels obstructive thromboinflammatory syndrome) as an atypical ARDS working&#xD;
      hypothesis. In fact, thromboembolic events rate in COVID-19 patients appears not negligible,&#xD;
      and a prophylactic utilization of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be&#xD;
      considered.Several biomarkers are under investigation to better determine the risk of&#xD;
      thromboembolic events and to determine the patients who could benefit more of a prophylactic&#xD;
      therapy with LMWH. Among others, D-Dimer is often elevated in COVID-19 patients and should be&#xD;
      used as the most important parameter for thromboembolic risk stratification, together with&#xD;
      other inflammation index like C-reactive-protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and ferritin.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a not negligible part of patient with COVID-19 pneumonia presents high D-dimer&#xD;
      level with computed tomography (CT) scan negative for pulmonary embolism. Despite these&#xD;
      patients could presents pulmonary microvascular thrombosis (MicroCLOTS), it has never been&#xD;
      proven and an aggressive anticoagulant treatment is currently not utilized. A diagnostic&#xD;
      technique more sensible than the CT scan on the small pulmonary arteries could theoretically&#xD;
      allow the detection of MicroCLOTS thus justifying a more aggressive anticoagulant regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography:The optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a near-infrared light&#xD;
      source-based imaging technique with a resolution of 10-20 um. It acquires longitudinal&#xD;
      sequences of cross-sectional images (100 frames/s) in a blood-free environment, resulting in&#xD;
      sharp border definition between lumen and vessel wall. It is routinely used in percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) to better characterize vessel anatomy, as well as ascertainment&#xD;
      of full stent deployment and expansion. Moreover, OCT has been shown to have a good&#xD;
      correlation with histology even in the evaluation of pulmonary artery morphology,&#xD;
      particularly in the evaluation of pulmonary arterial wall thickness. Furthermore, OCT has&#xD;
      been used to better characterized distal Type Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension,&#xD;
      and to guide its treatment with percutaneous transluminal pulmonary angioplasty. Hong et al&#xD;
      evaluated with OCT three patients who were highly suspected for peripheral pulmonary arteries&#xD;
      thrombi but had negative CT scan for pulmonary embolism. Thrombi were found in most of imaged&#xD;
      vessels in these patients. Red and white thrombi can be differentiated, according to features&#xD;
      of the thrombus on OCT images. After anticoagulation treatment, these patients' symptoms and&#xD;
      hypoxemia improved. Repeated OCT imaging showed that most thrombi disappeared or became&#xD;
      smaller. OCT was also used in evaluation of pulmonary arterial vasculopathy in Systemic&#xD;
      Sclerosis, showing an unexpected evidence of pulmonary artery thrombus formation in 19% of&#xD;
      systemic-sclerosis patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are sufficient data showing OCT to be a useful tool to identify intravascular thrombi&#xD;
      in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, together with an increase in&#xD;
      vessel wall thickness in most patients with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:To evaluate by intravascular OCT study the presence of microvascular&#xD;
      pulmonary thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, high D-dimer levels and contrast CT scan&#xD;
      negative for pulmonary thrombosis. Investigators will also evaluate the extension of&#xD;
      microvascular pulmonary thrombosis in patients with contrast CT scan positive for pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism in areas where contrast CT scan was negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria (part A): 1) Severe pulmonary coronarvirus disease 19 (COVID 19) with&#xD;

      s, at 400 psi of pressure (Acist, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). Automatic pullback at 20 mm/s);&#xD;
      If needed, blood samples can be taken through Recover catheter (Hexacath, Rueil-Malmaison,&#xD;
      France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedure will be performed: on &quot;healthy&quot; (without ground glass appearance at CT&#xD;
      scan) area in the same lung and on contralateral lung, both in &quot;ground glass&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot;&#xD;
      areas according to CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: 1) Overall safety of OCT procedure in COVID-19 pneumonia patients 2)&#xD;
      Presence of microvascular pulmonary thrombosis at OCT assessment in COVID-19 patients, both&#xD;
      in &quot;ground glass&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; ventilated areas.&#xD;

      estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 35 mmHg) and right ventricular disfunction&#xD;
      (RVD: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion &lt; 17 mm or Doppler tissue imaging S wave &lt;&#xD;
      9.5 cm/sec) 3) Dynamic correlations with standard inflammatory, coagulation and tissue damage&#xD;
      biomarkers: CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, NT-proBNPO, troponins, LDH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, sample size, statistical analysis: The study is an open label, prospective,&#xD;
      interventional clinical study of the safety, tolerability and potential diagnostic value of&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography for microvascular lung vessels obstructive thromboinflammatory&#xD;
      syndrome assessment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study and will be conducted in 10 patients with mild-to-severe ARDS.&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was designed for safety assessment based on a reference&#xD;
      population of last 100 patients who underwent OCT at our Institution for coronary Artery&#xD;
      Disease (CAD) in which a rate of SAEs lower than 1% have been recorded (personal&#xD;
      communication)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: As for safety analysis, the number of ADR (expected/unexpected) and SAEs&#xD;
      (expected/unexpected and/or related/not related) and the percentage of subjects experiencing&#xD;
      ADR and SAEs in the study will be summarized by severity and within body system involved.&#xD;
      Narratives will also be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Continuous variables will be summarized with indices of location (i.e.&#xD;
      mean or median) and dispersion (i.e. standard deviation or interquartile range), as&#xD;
      appropriate. All relevant estimates will be reported with the corresponding 95% Confidence&#xD;
      Intervals (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to event endpoints will be described using the Kaplan-Meier approach and estimates&#xD;
      at pre-defined time points will be obtained along with 95%Cis. Patients will be censored at&#xD;
      study closure, withdrawn of consent or loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses and regression models (i.e. logistic model on proportions and Cox model on&#xD;
      time to event outcomes) will be performed considering age, sex, biological features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal and Premature Termination or Suspension of Study Investigators may terminate a&#xD;
      study subject's participation in the study if: any clinical AE, or other medical condition or&#xD;
      situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best&#xD;
      interest of the subject, the subject meets an exclusion criterion, either newly developed or&#xD;
      not previously recognized (except those caused by ARDS and SARS-CoV-2 infection), that&#xD;
      precludes further study participation; this study may be suspended or prematurely terminated&#xD;
      if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for&#xD;
      study suspension or termination, will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundings: not appropriate. The procedure will be charged to SSN as a diagnostic procedure&#xD;
      applied to patients clinically suspected of microCLOTS in COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
