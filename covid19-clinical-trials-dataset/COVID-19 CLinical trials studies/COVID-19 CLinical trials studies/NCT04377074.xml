      This study seeks to investigate the levels of parental stress across different demographic&#xD;
      subgroups in the general parental population during the strict social distancing&#xD;
      government-initiated non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's) related to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. The study also seeks to examine the predictors of parental stress rates related to&#xD;
      these non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's). In addition, the research will investigate&#xD;
      the association between parental stress associated and psychopathology symptoms (i.e.,&#xD;
      depression and generalized anxiety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform the policymakers, the general public, scientists, and health practitioners about&#xD;
           the psychological associations of the COVID-19-related government-initiated measures on&#xD;
           parental stress, with special focus on the school and kindergarten lockdowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a foundation for policymakers and health-care professionals to employ&#xD;
           interventions that protect families against possibly increased psychological stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help policymakers and healthcare professionals to better understand the association of&#xD;
           demographic variables and other predictors on parental stress and parent-child&#xD;
           dysfunction, which information necessary for evaluating the psychological impact of NPIs&#xD;
           on parental stress and thus the framework under which decisions about&#xD;
           school/kindergarten lockdowns are made.&#xD;

      and psychopathology symptoms (i.e., depression and generalized anxiety) during the social&#xD;
      distancing interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform the policymakers, the general public, scientists, and health practitioners about&#xD;
           the psychological associations of the COVID-19-related government-initiated measures on&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Research Questions Hypothesis related to parental stress during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. H1: Gender (female), higher age, higher number of children, and having a pre-existing&#xD;
           psychiatric diagnosis will be associated with more parental distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. We assume to find differences in parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic based&#xD;
           on the existing literature on gender differences on parental behavior and distress&#xD;
           (Scott &amp; Alwin, 1989; Hildingsson &amp; Thomas, 2013; Deater-Deckard &amp; Scarr, 1996; McBride&#xD;
           et al., 2002; Skari et al., 2002). The literature further suggests that higher age and&#xD;
           higher number of children is associated with higher parental stress (Lavee et al., 1996;&#xD;
           Östberg &amp; Hagekull, 2000). Psychopathology symptoms, as reflected by having a&#xD;
           pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, is also found to be associated with parental stress&#xD;
           (Pripp et al., 2010; Crugnola et al., 2016; Vismara et al., 2016; Leigh &amp; Milgrom, 2008;&#xD;
           Prino et al., 2016; Rollé et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. H2: Worry and rumination in general, low self-efficacy, difficulty with working from&#xD;
           home, burnout, low social support, and higher anger expression related to children are&#xD;
           all associated with more parental distress, when age, number of children, gender and&#xD;
           pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis are controlled for.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Existing research literature have highlighted that perceived personal control is&#xD;
           found to be directly related to parental stress (Guterman, 2009), and that women's&#xD;
           levels of parental stress is related to parenting self-efficacy (Suzuki, 2010). Sepa and&#xD;
           colleges (2004) also reported that lack of confidence/security were linked to parental&#xD;
           stress. Reduced social support is also found to be associated with higher rates of&#xD;
           parental stress (Östberg &amp; Hagekull, 2000; Crnic et al., 1983; Suzuki, 2010; Koeske &amp;&#xD;
           Koeske, 1990; Sepa et al., 2004). Furthermore, anger expression is also found to be&#xD;
           associated with parental stress in the existing research literature (Lam, 1999). We also&#xD;
           hypothesize that burnout, worry and rumination in general and difficulty with working&#xD;
           from home will be associated with higher parental stress, relations not previously&#xD;
           explored in the existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. H3: More parental distress will be associated with more depressive symptoms and anxiety&#xD;
           symptoms, when gender, pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, age and number of children&#xD;
           are controlled for.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Previous studies have found that parents with psychological problems, such as&#xD;
                depression and generalized anxiety disorder, are at greater risk for parenting&#xD;
                stress, and that parental stress may result in depression and anxiety (Pripp et&#xD;
                al., 2010; Crugnola et al., 2016; Vismara et al., 2016; Leigh &amp; Milgrom, 2008;&#xD;
                Prino et al., 2016; Rollé et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Additionally, we will investigate the differences in levels of parental distress&#xD;
      across different demographic subgroups in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires including demographic&#xD;
      variables, psychological symptoms, situational factors related to the consequences of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus, personality-trait and, and worry, in a random order. Some questionnaires are&#xD;
      given as a whole, whereas other questions include theoretically driven selections of items&#xD;
      from validated questionnaires, based on a panel of clinical experts, with the goal of&#xD;
      avoiding topological overlap. This study is part of a 'The Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health&#xD;
      and Adherence Project' involving multiple studies. In order to not overwhelm and burden the&#xD;
      participants with long questionnaire, and due to the mentioned empirical concerns of&#xD;
      topological overlap (i.e., overlap in item content) between similar items (for network&#xD;
      analysis purposes), in some scales involving large item-content overlap, single items were&#xD;
      chosen in a theory-driven manner by three independent clinical psychologists and clinical&#xD;
      specialists in adult psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection started during the time-period with the strictest and equal number of&#xD;
      government-initiated non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's) in Norway, and data collection&#xD;
      was stopped once these NPI's were modified or new information about NPI's were added. The&#xD;
      data include one directly identifiable variable (contact information) for participants in&#xD;
      accordance to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law in EU, which is to give the&#xD;
      participants the opportunity to have their data deleted upon request. Data are thus kept on a&#xD;
      safe server belonging to the University of Oslo and will be accessed first following&#xD;
      de-identification. Stopping rule for data collection: Stopping rule: 1) At once if&#xD;
      government-initiated NPI's are modified or novel information are given about NPIs (to control&#xD;
      for cognitive variables) and/ or 2) once we reach enough participants given the power&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: PHQ-9; GAD-7; parental stress; demographic variables (gender; age; civil status;&#xD;
      employment status; education level; number of children in household); situational variables&#xD;
      (difficulty to work from home; burnout; anger expression related to children; social support;&#xD;
      worried or ruminated on problems); person-trait variables (self-efficacy (&quot;I can always&#xD;
      manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough) and whether one has a psychiatric&#xD;
      diagnosis or not. The self-efficacy item is chosen from The General Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      (Tambs &amp; Røysamb, 2014). The parental stress subscale is based on three items from the Danish&#xD;
      Parental Stress Scale (Potoppidan et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome variables are Parental Stress, consisting of a total score of parental stress&#xD;
      based on items from the Danish parental stress scale; PHQ-9; GAD-7. The other variables are&#xD;
      predictors of these three outcome variables. For the parental stress regression analyses we&#xD;
      will include the following variables: age, gender, number of children in household,&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnosis, difficulty to work from home, worry and rumination; anger expression&#xD;
      related to children, social support and self-efficacy. The other two multiple regression&#xD;
      analysis will investigate whether parental stress is associated with depression and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms while controlling for the following variables: gender, age, number of children in&#xD;
      household and psychiatric diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the large sample size, the investigators pre-defined our significance level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      p&lt; 0.01 to determine significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mentioned 'Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence Project' involves multiple&#xD;
      studies, where some involve a Complex Systems (Network analysis) approach. These mutlivariate&#xD;
      analyses require large samples and power analysis was conducted accordingly. Following power&#xD;
      analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer (2017), it is recommended that the number of&#xD;
      participants be at the very least three times larger than the number of estimated parameters.&#xD;
      However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975) for multivariate research,&#xD;
      recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of estimated parameters.&#xD;
      Thus, with the more conservative estimates by Roscoe, an optimal sample size for the specific&#xD;
      study on parents included more than 2530 individuals. According to the stopping rule&#xD;
      mentioned above, due to the importance of keeping the NPI variable constant, we would stop&#xD;
      data collection even if we did not obtain our target N. Fortunately, sufficient sample was&#xD;
      reached during a period with identical NPIs across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three multiple regression analysis will be conducted; one with parental stress; the second&#xD;
      and third with PHQ-9 and GAD total scores as dependent variables. Specific predictors for&#xD;
      these three multiple regression analyses are listed above (hypothesis section).&#xD;
      Multicollinarity and other assumptions will be checked; if the multicollinearity is violated&#xD;
      (if VIF &gt; 5 and Tolerance &gt; 0.2; Hocking, 2003); O'Brian, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that this the project outline, study plan and analysis was registered upon application&#xD;
      to the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) and Norwegian Centre&#xD;
      for Research Data 10 days prior data collection, two committees which evaluate the rational&#xD;
      for data collection and hypotheses as well as evaluate the ethical aspects of the study&#xD;
      before allowing the data to be collected. The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov after&#xD;
      completed data collection, although this registration is prior to any analysis of the data.&#xD;

    <description>Three items from the Danish Parental Stress Scale (PSS) was selected, which intends to be a short measure of perceived stress resulting from being a parent (Pontoppidan et al., 2018). The scale consists of nine items measuring parental stress where each is measured on a five-point Likert scale (1-5), with the scores ranging from 3 to 15. Higher scores indicate higher parental stress. The following three were chosen in this large-scale investigation: 1) I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a parent. 2) The major source of stress in my life is my child(ren), and 3) It is difficult to balance different responsibilities because of my child(ren) (Pontoppidan et al., 2018).</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer &amp; Williams, 2001) is used to measure symptoms of depression in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. The questionnaire consists of nine items where each is scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the range of scores from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, and scores above 10 are considered as the cut-off that indicating that the patient is within the depressive area.</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams &amp; Löwe, 2006) is a questionnaire consisting of seven items measuring symptoms of anxiety and worry. The items are scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the scores ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety severity, and scores that are above the cutoff of 10 are considered to be in the clinical range (Spitzer et al., 2006). Specific cut-off for Norwegian samples have been found yielding a cut-off of 8 and above for high sensitivity and specificity (Johnson, Ulvenes, Øktedalen &amp; Hoffart, 2019).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Eligible participants are all parents (over 18 years) living with one or more child under&#xD;
        18 years, and/or a child over 18 with special needs (i.e. physical disabilities). All&#xD;
        participants are currently living in Norway and thus experiencing identical NPIs, and who&#xD;
        had provided digital consent to partake in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        How the participants were reached:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Given the time-sensitivity of the project and the strict and time-consuming process of&#xD;
        getting approval to access registry data, the investigators did not apply for access to&#xD;
        registry data (e.g., address, phone or e-mails of the general population), as such data&#xD;
        access is highly strict and regulated in Norway and the time-frame of such an application&#xD;
        could have encompassed variation in an important variable we wished to hold constant&#xD;
        (namely identical NPIs (non-pharmacological interventions) employed over the time-frame of&#xD;
        data collection). Thus, the investigators did not apply for registry data, reached out the&#xD;
        population through the means elaborated below. The investigators reached out to the general&#xD;
        Norwegian population systematically in the following six ways, with the goal of providing&#xD;
        the entire adult population an equal opportunity to be exposed to the survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Through broadcasting on the main national news channel of Norway which had nearly 1.1&#xD;
             million viewers at the time of broadcast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Using Facebook Business Advertisement where we exposed all adult Norwegian Facebook&#xD;
             users (3.6 million; 85% of the Norwegian adult population) with an equal opportunity&#xD;
             of being exposed to the survey in a random manner. Our survey reached a random&#xD;
             selection of nearly 180 000 of the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Broadcasting the survey on national and region radio stations across the country&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Broadcasting about the survey on local radio stations across the country&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Using national newspaper to reach out to participants about the survey&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Using regional and local newspapers to reach out to participants across all regions&#xD;
             and counties in Norway.&#xD;
