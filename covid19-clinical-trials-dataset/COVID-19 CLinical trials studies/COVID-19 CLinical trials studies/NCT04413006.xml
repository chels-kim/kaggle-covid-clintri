  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of COVID-19 and measures taken by the Canadian Government to reduce the&#xD;
      transmission of the virus, in-person psychology services have been suspended. Psychology&#xD;
      services are now being conducted via video conferencing. The purpose of the current project&#xD;
      is to pilot-test a 6-week Self Compassion Treatment for Chronic Pain delivered virtually, in&#xD;
      order to understand its utility in the current environment. The treatment is to be delivered&#xD;
      through a secure professional ZOOM licence. Objective 1 of the project is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of attending the treatment group through virtual participation.&#xD;
      Objective 2 is to assess the effectiveness of the group treatment in improving&#xD;
      self-compassion, mental health, relationship with pain, and quality of life.&#xD;

      Participants will be adult psychology outpatients of one of the two tertiary care pain&#xD;
      clinics in Winnipeg, or patients of one of the psychologists working in the Clinical Health&#xD;
      Psychology Program, and who would normally have been invited to attend an in-person&#xD;
      group-based intervention at the Health Sciences Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a set of questionnaires that are standard in our clinic, and that&#xD;
      will be accessed via the online survey platform, Survey Gizmo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 6-weeks of the virtual Self-Compassion for Chronic Pain Treatment&#xD;
      Group. Session 1: Participant introductions. Introduction of concepts: Self-Compassion (and&#xD;
      how it differs from Self-Esteem, Self-Pity, or Self-Indulgence), rationale of self-compassion&#xD;
      for chronic pain. Introductory experiential self-compassion exercises. Assignment of&#xD;
      homework. Session 2: Check-in and homework review. Introduction to mindfulness and its&#xD;
      applicability in self-compassion. Brief body scan and mindfulness of the breath exercises.&#xD;
      ACT Matrix exercise. Additional experiential self-compassion exercises. Discussion of&#xD;
      awareness of pleasant experiences. Assignment of homework (including awareness of pleasant&#xD;
      experiences throughout the week). Session 3: Check-in and homework review. Self-Compassion in&#xD;
      relationships and being present and compassionate in our relationships. Loving-kindness&#xD;
      meditation. Additional experiential self-compassion exercises Assignment of homework. Session&#xD;
      4: Check-in and homework review. Self-Compassion in the face of difficulties. Working with&#xD;
      difficult emotions (e.g., shame, guilt, anger, self-criticism) with self-compassion.&#xD;
      Additional experiential self-compassion exercises. Assignment of homework. Session 5:&#xD;
      Check-in and homework review. Self-care in chronic pain management. Cultivating gratitude,&#xD;
      self-appreciation and savouring attitudes. Additional experiential self-compassion exercises.&#xD;
      Assignment of homework. Session 6: Check-in and homework review. Compassionate body scan.&#xD;
      Review of program. A look forward (strategies to maintain practices, prepare for setbacks and&#xD;
      get back on track). Wrap-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. All participants who were scheduled to attend an in-person group-based therapy&#xD;
      program will be contacted to invite them to participate in this new virtual group. They will&#xD;
      be assured that their decision to participate (or to not participate) in this study will not&#xD;
      impact their eligibility for participation in the next in-person group, when in-person groups&#xD;
      resume. Additionally, current patients of pain psychologists in the Clinical Health&#xD;
      Psychology Program will be invited to the new program at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      psychologist (this is in line with current practices). They will be informed that because&#xD;
      they are participating in a new group, a novel delivery format, and a unique environment, the&#xD;
      group program will be evaluated as part of a research study. If they agree to be part of the&#xD;
      study verbally, they will be sent a link to the Consent form and baseline questionnaires&#xD;
      through Survey Gizmo. Baseline questionnaires will be reviewed prior to beginning of the&#xD;
      group, and all participants who score in the &quot;severe&quot; range on the PHQ-9 (i.e. a score of 20&#xD;
      or higher), or who score a &quot;2 or higher&quot; on item number 9 (Thoughts that you would be better&#xD;
      off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself in some way) will be contacted by telephone for&#xD;
      further screening. They may then be offered individual distance therapy rather than the&#xD;
      group-based therapy, as per Dr. Sabourin's assessment. All consented participants will be&#xD;
      contacted by one of the two therapists (Ms. Amanda Shamblaw, Psychology Resident or Dr.&#xD;
      Brigitte Sabourin, PhD, CPsych) prior to beginning the group in order to test out the&#xD;
      connection and problem-solve any difficulties. They will also be given some preliminary&#xD;
      instructions regarding attending a video-based appointment, as per the Clinical Health&#xD;
      Psychology Program's guidelines. These include a 2-part verification of patient&#xD;
      identification (date of birth and Patient health identification number - PHIN), informing&#xD;
      participants that &quot;Despite our best efforts to ensure high level of privacy and secure&#xD;
      technology, there is always a risk that the transmission be breached and accessed by&#xD;
      unauthorized persons&quot;, &quot;no sessions are recorded&quot;, &quot;no personal information is shared with&#xD;
      Zoom&quot;. They will then verbally consent to proceed. Participants will participate in the 6&#xD;
      weekly sessions in groups of 10-12 participants. At the beginning of each session, each&#xD;
      participant will be in a virtual &quot;waiting room&quot;, and either Ms. Shamblaw or Dr. Sabourin will&#xD;
      confirm the participant's location and phone number prior to admitting them to the group. The&#xD;
      location and phone numbers are collected in order to be able to reach participants if needed.&#xD;
      They will complete measures post-treatment and at a 3-month follow-up using Survey Gizmo.&#xD;
      Finally, following treatment, participants will have the option to participate in a&#xD;
      semi-structured qualitative interview to discuss their impressions of the group, impressions&#xD;
      of attending virtually, support they felt from other group members, and general group&#xD;
      cohesion feedback. Participants will be informed that the interview is voluntary and will not&#xD;
      affect their participation in the treatment group.&#xD;
