    <textblock>
      Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) first-in-human study in healthy subjects. Safety and tolerability&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted, and blood samples will be taken pre-dose and at several time&#xD;
      points post-dose for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the SAD segment of the study, up to 4 ascending cohorts of 8 healthy subjects each will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of study drug (AV-001 or placebo) in a sequential ascending manner.&#xD;
      Planned doses may be adapted depending on emergent safety, tolerability and available PK&#xD;
      data. Screening evaluations will occur from Day -28 to Day -2. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical unit on Day -2. On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to AV-001 (6&#xD;
      subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) and receive a single dose of study drug. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged on Day 2 after all post dose assessments have been completed and if there are no&#xD;
      medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. An end of study visit will be&#xD;
      conducted 7 to 10 days after Day 1 or at early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial sentinel group consisting of 1 subject receiving AV-001 and 1 subject receiving&#xD;
      placebo will proceed for each cohort prior to treatment of the remainder of the cohort. After&#xD;
      study drug administration to the sentinel group and an appropriate safety interval (at least&#xD;
      24 hours and per the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI)), the remaining 5 subjects&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of AV-001 and 1 subject will receive placebo administered in the&#xD;
      same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK blood samples will be collected at 15 time points relative to study drug dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
      PD blood samples for will be collected at 6 time points on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MAD segment of the study, up to 2 ascending cohorts of 8 subjects each will receive&#xD;
      once daily doses of study drug (AV-001 or placebo) for at least 7 days in a sequential&#xD;
      ascending manner. Planned doses may be adapted and will be determined by the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and PK data from the SAD part of the study. Screening evaluations will occur&#xD;
      from Day -28 to Day -2. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -2. On&#xD;
      Day 1, subjects will be randomized to AV-001 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects). Subjects&#xD;
      will receive once-daily doses of study drug from Day 1 through Day 7. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged on Day 8 after all post dose assessments have been completed and if there are no&#xD;
      medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. An end of study visit will be&#xD;
      conducted 7 to 10 days after Day 7 or at early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK blood samples will be collected at 15 time points relative to study drug dosing on Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 7 in addition to predose levels on Days 2 to 6. PD blood samples for will be&#xD;
      collected at 6 time points on Day 1 and Day 7.&#xD;
