      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose hydroxychloroquine as primary prevention in&#xD;
      healthcare workers Design, participants and interventions: Prospective, randomized, parallel&#xD;
      group, double-blinded, placebo controlled, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      including 440 participants who will be randomised to 2 treatment arms: hydroxychloroquine or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables: symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR, viral&#xD;
      load during SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion during the study period, incidence of any&#xD;
      acute respiratory infection, days of sick leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations: No trials have been published investigating the efficacy of HCQ&#xD;
      as primary prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers. Thus, sample size&#xD;
      calculations in the proposed trial are based on the investigators' best estimates for several&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance to the effect of oseltamivir against symptomatic influenza, we assumed an&#xD;
      approximate effectiveness of approximately 60% (HR of 0.4)&#xD;
      (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6464969/) as realistic. As a prophylactic&#xD;
      intervention with HCQ, which may have side effects and for which supply shortage can be&#xD;
      expected, was judged justifiable only if its effectiveness is high, we based our sample size&#xD;
      consideration on a HR of 0.3. To estimate the probability of an event in both the&#xD;
      experimental and the control group, very little data is available. In a Dutch&#xD;
      point-prevalence study 0-10% of health-care workers were infected depending on the healthcare&#xD;
      institution, depending on the hospital. This point-prevalence study was performed between 6&#xD;
      and 9 March, when the reported number of cases in the Netherlands was 33 and 77,&#xD;
      respectively, according to the RIVM&#xD;
      (https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/resultaat-steekproef-4-ziekenhuismedewerkers-heeft-coronavirus).&#xD;
      Additionally, in an a report published in the Lancet, 20% of responding healthcare workers in&#xD;
      Italy were found to be infected with SARS-CoV2 within less than one month&#xD;
      (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30627-9/fulltext).&#xD;
      Several media reports indicate that this proportion is similar across various healthcare&#xD;
      institutions and countries&#xD;
      (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/europe/coronavirus-europe-covid-19.html) and&#xD;
      (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/spain-tightens-restrictions-week-lockdown-begins-2003&#xD;
      30191539568.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the proposed study will be performed in a high-risk setting, we assumed an event (i.e. PCR&#xD;
      positivity) probability of 10% in the control group and 3% in the experimental arm after the&#xD;
      maximum study period. In summary, a sample size of 210 participants per arm is necessary to&#xD;
      detect a HR of 0.3 with a power of 80.3% with an alpha-error of 0.05. To account for&#xD;
      drop-outs and asymptomatic, undetected infection at inclusion or past infection with existing&#xD;
      immunity, an additional 10 participants will randomized per treatment arm. The overall study&#xD;
      population is therefore 440 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be based on two populations: A Modified Intention to Treat&#xD;
      population excluding those who withdrew consent after randomization and those with a positive&#xD;
      serology at baseline. And a per protocol population including all randomized subjects who&#xD;
      completed at least 3 out of 4 follow-up visits and took at least 80% of all doses of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
