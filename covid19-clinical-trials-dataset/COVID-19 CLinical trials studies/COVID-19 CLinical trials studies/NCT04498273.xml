      A multi-center adaptive randomized placebo-controlled platform trial evaluating the efficacy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 Outpatient Thrombosis Prevention Trial is a multi-center adaptive randomized&#xD;
      double-blind placebo-controlled platform trial to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      anti-coagulation with anti-platelet agents and with placebo to prevent thrombotic events in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who have evidence of increased inflammation based on&#xD;
      elevated D-dimer and hsCRP levels, yet are not admitted to hospital as COVID-19 related&#xD;
      symptoms are currently stable. Participants will all be adults between 40 and 79 years who&#xD;
      will be enrolled from approximately 100 facilities, such as emergency rooms and other&#xD;
      settings where a physician is present to evaluate the patient for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be contacted either electronically or by telephone within 24 hours of randomization to confirm receipt of the study treatment. Study drug will be shipped to subjects home. Subjects will take Apixaban 2.5 MG twice a day; once in the morning and once in the evening for 45 days. Subjects will be contacted (electronic or telephone) minimally weekly after initial start of study medication and contact will continue up to day 75 after starting study treatment. Follow up electronic contact will be dependent on initial patient response, compliance with response, and medication adherence, for the trial duration using electronic contacts and through telephone contacts. Participants will be queried for any clinically relevant endpoints, especially major bleeding, or need to seek healthcare attention for any reason. Follow-up will occur from the time of study drug receipt and through the 30 day safety period.</description>
