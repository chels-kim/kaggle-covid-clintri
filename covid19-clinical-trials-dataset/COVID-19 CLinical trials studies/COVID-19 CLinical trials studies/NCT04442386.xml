  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to investigate the levels of parental burnout in the general parental&#xD;
      population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental burnout is measured three months following&#xD;
      (T2) the initiated viral mitigation protocols in Norway, a period where schools and&#xD;
      kindergartens were closed, involving a period of home isolation for parents with their&#xD;
      children. The burden of parents during this period is thought to have increased, as they were&#xD;
      expected to conduct their own work virtually where possible, while at the same time acting as&#xD;
      teachers for their children. The study aims to investigate the level of burnout among parents&#xD;
      after months of viral mitigation strategies involved in the pandemic, in addition to&#xD;
      predictors of parental burnout measured at (T1) are associated with parental burnout after&#xD;
      three months (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 1: What is the level of parental burnout in the general parental population&#xD;
      three months following initiated viral mitigation protocols (i.e., physical distancing) as&#xD;
      compared to other similar pre-pandemic samples?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Parental burnout will be higher in the present sample three months into the&#xD;
      pandemic as compared to similar pre-pandemic samples in similar populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Levels of parental stress, parental satisfaction, general self-efficacy,&#xD;
      positive metacognitions, negative metacognitions, unhelpful coping strategies, marital&#xD;
      quality and insomnia, all at T2 will significantly predict levels of parental burnout at T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Do the predictors parental stress, parental satisfaction, general self-efficacy,&#xD;
      positive metacognitions, negative metacognitions, unhelpful coping strategies, all at&#xD;
      baseline (T1), predict parental burnout at T2, beyond and above these same aforementioned&#xD;
      predictors at T2 and pre-existing mental health condition, age, gender, and education?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Levels of parental burnout will be explored across subgroups in the sample.&#xD;

      positive metacognitions, negative metacognitions, unhelpful coping strategies, all at&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exploratory: Levels of parental burnout will be explored across subgroups in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A hierarchical regression analysis will be conducted with Parental&#xD;
      burnout (PBI) as the dependent variable. In the first step, stable characteristics (control&#xD;
      variables) will be included: gender, education, and age. In the second step, parental stress,&#xD;
      parental satisfaction, general self-efficacy, positive metacognitions, negative&#xD;
      metacognitions, and unhelpful coping strategies, marital quality, and insomnia, all at T2&#xD;
      will be included.. In the final step, parental stress, parental satisfaction, general&#xD;
      self-efficacy, positive metacognitions, negative metacognitions, and unhelpful coping&#xD;
      strategies, all at T1 will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part correlations will be reported, presenting the effect size of the hypothesized predictors&#xD;
      on parental burnout. A part (semi-partial) correlation gives the least biased and easiest&#xD;
      interpretable estimate of the strength of a predictive relationship (Dudgeon, 2016). It is&#xD;
      the correlation between the outcome and the aspects of the predictor unique from all the&#xD;
      other predictors. As a type of correlation, its size can be evaluated according to Cohen's&#xD;
      (1988) criteria: small &gt;=0.10, medium &gt;=0.30, large &gt;=0.50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicollinearity and other statistical assumptions will be checked. Multicollinearity will&#xD;
      be assessed with common guidelines (VIF &lt; 5 and Tolerance &gt; 0.2; Hocking, 2003; O'Brian,&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics with frequency tables including N, means, SDs and other standard&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will examine the research question concerning general levels of mental&#xD;
      well-being. Subgroup differences will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses and questions addressed in the forthcoming paper that are not pre-specified in&#xD;
      this pre-registered protocol will be defined as exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses and random subsample replications of the main findings will be conducted&#xD;
      following selection of a random sample of participants that ensure a proportionate ratio&#xD;
      between the collected sample and the adult population of Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any questions addressed in the forthcoming paper which is not pre-specified in this protocol&#xD;
      will be explicitly defined as exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria Given the estimated large sample size which the investigators hope to&#xD;
      collect in this study, the investigators pre-define their significance level: p &lt; 0.01 to&#xD;
      determine significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is part of a larger project with the first part aiming to investigate&#xD;
      predictors of parental burnout through regression analyses, and the second part aiming to&#xD;
      examine directional relations amongst specific symptoms and their centrality through complex&#xD;
      systems approaches (i.e., network analysis). Consequently, power calculations are based on&#xD;
      power required for network analyses. Following power analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer&#xD;
      (2017), it is recommended that the number of participants are three times larger than the&#xD;
      number of estimated parameters. However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975)&#xD;
      for multivariate research, recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of&#xD;
      estimated parameters. Thus, following these two approaches respectively, between 900 to 3000&#xD;
      participants are required. Data will be collected for three weeks, and participants are based&#xD;
      on a representative and random sample of Norwegian adults, randomly selected and provided&#xD;
      equal opportunity to partake in the study, providing digital consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TSD system (Services for Sensitive Data), a platform used in Norway to store&#xD;
      person-sensitive data verifies participants officially through a kind of national ID number&#xD;
      to give them full right to withdraw their data at any time, following the European GDPR&#xD;
      (General Data Protection Regulation) laws. Accordingly, participants are allowed to withdraw&#xD;
      their own data at any time. The survey includes mandatory fields of response. Participation&#xD;
      is voluntarily, and withdrawal of provided data is possible at any moment. The investigators&#xD;
      do not expect participants to withdraw their data and thus expect no missing data. However,&#xD;
      if participants do withdraw their data, the investigators will conduct state-of-art missing&#xD;
      data analyses and investigate whether data is missing at random.&#xD;

    <description>The Parental Burnout Inventory (PBI) (Roskam et al., 2017) consists of 22 items related to three divisions of parental burnout: Personal Accomplishment, Emotional Exhaustion and Emotional Distancing. The inventory is rated on a seven-point Likert-scale ranging from never (0) to every day (6). Higher scores indicate greater parental burnout severity, and scores above 88 are considered as the cut-off for parental burnout (Roskam et al., 2017).</description>
