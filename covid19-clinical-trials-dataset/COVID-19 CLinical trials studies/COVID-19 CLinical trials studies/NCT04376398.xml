  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has an important impact on the health care provided by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologists. Different societies of anesthesiology have provided guidelines and&#xD;
      recommendations on how to manage patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 or&#xD;
      suspected to be infected. It is therefore important to know whether these guidelines have&#xD;
      been implemented or were possible to be implemented. Otherwise patients who are presenting&#xD;
      COVID-19 often show pulmonary complications. The airway management and the ventilation&#xD;
      management of these patients can be therefore challenging and can possibly influence their&#xD;
      outcome. It is thus important to obtain a large database with information about the&#xD;
      characteristics of these patients, how these patients have been managed and their in-hospital&#xD;
      outcome. Information regarding the correct implementation of guidelines is as well necessary&#xD;
      for future guidance of health care providers.&#xD;
