  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how patients use and engage with a game-based mobile&#xD;
      application that is designed to treat opioid use disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, decentralized study to evaluate patient&#xD;
      engagement with PEAR-008, a game-based digital therapeutic for the treatment of opioid use&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEAR-008 is a new version of reSET-O, an FDA-authorized mobile application treatment&#xD;
      (available by prescription only) for opioid use disorder. The study will examine if changing&#xD;
      the application's delivery format and enhancing clinical content affects how patients use and&#xD;
      interact with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will complete a short screening assessment and if eligible complete&#xD;
      informed consent procedures at the beginning of the Baseline visit. Qualifying participants&#xD;
      will attend weekly virtual study visits during the 8-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to weekly assessments, additional assessments will be administered at week 4 and&#xD;
      week 8. Participants will be asked to complete a follow-up assessment 4 weeks after&#xD;
      completing treatment.&#xD;
