  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People have had to make a lot of changes to their lives due to the COVID-19 health crisis.&#xD;
      Most experts agree that social distancing and other safety measures have taken a toll on&#xD;
      people s mental health. Amish and Mennonite communities often have large families. They may&#xD;
      have limited access to health care. Their lifestyle is based on interaction and group events&#xD;
      rather than technology. So people in Amish and Mennonite communities may experience the&#xD;
      pandemic in their own special ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the relationship between stress related to the pandemic and self-rated measures&#xD;
      of mental health symptoms and distress among Amish and Mennonite people with bipolar disorder&#xD;
      and related conditions, and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who are taking part in the NIMH AMBiGen study (80-M-0083).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be mailed 4 surveys. One survey will ask about depression symptoms. One&#xD;
      survey will ask about mania symptoms. One survey will assess a broad range of psychological&#xD;
      problems. One survey will assess the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health. They will&#xD;
      fill out the surveys 4 times over 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surveys will not include participants names, just codes. This will help protect privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in 80-M-0083 will be used. This includes data about participants genes,&#xD;
      medical conditions, and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get an 800 number they can call to speak to the research team. They can&#xD;
      also write to the team if they prefer. Participants who wish will get referrals for mental&#xD;
      health services. Participation will last up to 24 months. There will be an option for&#xD;
      recontact in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol leverages existing NIMH studies and participants to accomplish time-sensitive&#xD;
      research on the mental health impact of environmental stressors imposed by the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. The study will describe the relationship between stressors related to COVID-19 and&#xD;
      self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among Amish and Mennonite&#xD;
      participants in an ongoing study of bipolar disorder (AMBiGen), and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the relationship between stressors related&#xD;
      to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among individuals&#xD;
      with bipolar disorder, related conditions, and their family members. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to determine the roles played by psychiatric diagnosis, genetic risk of various mental&#xD;
      illnesses, and perceived social support in moderating risk and resilience for mental health&#xD;
      during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

        The sample size will be up to 1,000 and will include participants 18 years and older of&#xD;
        both sexes, any gender, and health status. This sample size is an estimate of the number of&#xD;
        individuals who have enrolled the NIMH AmBiGen study in the past and might respond if&#xD;
        re-contacted, as well as family members who may not have enrolled in the past but are&#xD;
        expected to share genetic, familial, and community risk/resilience factors.&#xD;
