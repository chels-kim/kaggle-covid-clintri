  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Massive number of clinicians were infected during the outbreak of COVID-19, which raised the&#xD;
      concerns of utilizing &quot;aerosol generating procedures&quot;, particularly the use of high-flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, intubation, bronchoscopy examination and pulmonary&#xD;
      function test. There appears to be a trend to avoid those treatments. Instead, aggressive&#xD;
      intubation might cause shortage of medical devices and add extra workload. Therefore, we&#xD;
      aimed to do a clinical observational study to evaluate the aerosol generation in these&#xD;
      procedures and explore the potential measures to reduce the aerosol generation or dispersion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intent is to monitor exhaled aerosol produced by COVID-19 patients pre and post aerosol&#xD;
      generating procedures. Monitoring will occur at a distance of 1 and 3 feet from the subject's&#xD;
      airway. This observational study will be conducted in standard patient hospital rooms&#xD;
      (standard or negative pressure room).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>High-flow nasal cannula</intervention_name>
    <description>High-flow nasal cannula is a modality of oxygen device that can provide gas flow meets or exceeds patient inspiratory flow demand (flow can be set at 10-60 L/min), it has been proven to improve oxygenation and reduce intubation rate in hypoxemic patients.</description>

    <intervention_name>bronchoscopy examination</intervention_name>
    <description>is a procedure that allows a doctor to examine the inside of the lungs, including the bronchi, which are the main pathways into the lungs. During a bronchoscopy, a doctor inserts a thin tube containing a light and camera into the lungs through the nose or mouth or via artificial airway such as intubation or tracheotomy tube</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>intubation</intervention_name>
    <description>Intubation is the process of inserting a tube, called an endotracheal tube (ET), through the mouth and then into the airway. This is done so that a patient can be placed on a ventilator to assist with breathing during anesthesia, sedation, or severe illness.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>tracheostomy</intervention_name>
    <description>A tracheostomy is a medical procedure - either temporary or permanent - that involves creating an opening in the neck in order to place a tube into a person's windpipe. The tube is inserted through a cut in the neck below the vocal cords. This allows air to enter the lungs.</description>

    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Pulmonary function test</intervention_name>
    <description>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are noninvasive tests that show how well the lungs are working. The tests measure lung volume, capacity, rates of flow, and gas exchange.</description>
