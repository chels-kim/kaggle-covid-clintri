      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of several marketed&#xD;
      commercial or prototype test kits for antibody to SARS-CoV-2. The focus will be on&#xD;
      rapid-format, point-of-care antibody test kits that detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to&#xD;
      recombinant viral proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: No voluntary enrolment into this study will be conducted; all testing is to be&#xD;
      conducted anonymously.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular (RT-PCR) tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19. They&#xD;
      detect viral RNA and are a good marker for current infection and infectivity. However, these&#xD;
      tests are expensive and in short supply. In advanced COVID-19 cases, virus concentration in&#xD;
      the upper respiratory tract is often low, as the infection has spread to the lungs and viral&#xD;
      RNA is sometimes undetectable by RT-PCR using nasal swaps. Antibody tests detect human&#xD;
      antibodies to viral proteins in the blood or other body fluids. They could be useful for&#xD;
      diagnosing current infections (slightly less sensitive than RT-PCR tests), and they remain&#xD;
      positive after persons have recovered from the infection. Thus, antibody tests are expected&#xD;
      to be useful for diagnosis of current infections, for verifying recent infections in persons&#xD;
      who were not tested by RT-PCR when they were ill, and for documenting possible immunity to&#xD;
      the virus. Antibody tests may be especially valuable for use in low and middle income&#xD;
      countries that lack resources for widespread molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated test sensitivity and specificity. Manufacturer data for several antibody tests&#xD;
      claim that more than 90% of persons with COVID-19 (clinical symptoms and positive molecular&#xD;
      tests) have positive antibody test results for IgM and/or IgG. They also claim specificity in&#xD;
      the range of 93-95% for samples from persons who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of antibody tests. In recent months, many antibody tests have been developed and&#xD;
      marketed. The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND, closely linked to World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) and supported by a large grant from the United Kingdom government) in&#xD;
      Geneva Switzerland reported that they had identified more than 70 such tests, and they&#xD;
      shortlisted 27 tests for further evaluation. Of these, only one test produced in the USA&#xD;
      (produced by Cellex) has received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US FDA, and&#xD;
      no test has formal FDA approval. Antibody tests use different diagnostic platforms, but most&#xD;
      tests use the SARS-CoV-2 S1protein, and a few tests also use the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Few&#xD;
      studies that independently evaluated the performance of these rapid antibody tests have been&#xD;
      published to date in peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, more data are needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, and value of these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Weil Lab research group at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) has extensive&#xD;
      experience developing and evaluating rapid format diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.&#xD;
      The group has special interest in infectious disease diagnostics that can be used in low and&#xD;
      middle income countries and is used to work under challenging conditions after disease&#xD;
      outbreaks. In this project, rapid-format antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be evaluated and&#xD;
      antibody test results will be compared with results of RT-PCR and metadata (age, gender,&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, time after exposure when known).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient samples. Deidentified serum or plasma samples will be tested from patients who have&#xD;
      been hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19. Control samples from our serum bank&#xD;
      (deidentified samples from healthy humans and samples from persons with parasitic diseases)&#xD;
      will also be tested. The number of serum or plasma samples to be tested will be left open,&#xD;
      but this will depend in part on the number of samples available and the availability of test&#xD;
      kits. It is anticipated that approximately 500 samples will be tested initially, but more may&#xD;
      be tested if that is necessary to achieve study objectives. The tests and research are for&#xD;
      research only, and we will not report test results from individual patient samples to&#xD;
      clinicians to support patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: No voluntary enrolment into this study will be conducted; all testing is to be&#xD;
      conducted anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody test kits. Marketed commercial or prototype antibody detection kits will be obtained&#xD;
      by donation or purchase. Tests to be evaluated are to be determined, but this will depend on&#xD;
      availability and cost. The focus will be on rapid-format, point-of-care antibody test kits&#xD;
      that detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to recombinant viral proteins. The goal is to test at&#xD;
      least five (5) different kits including at least two (2) that are manufactured in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test procedures. Manufacturers' package inserts or protocols for test performance will be&#xD;
      followed. These vary across different test platforms. Persons who perform the tests will not&#xD;
      know PCR results or other metadata associated with the human samples when they perform the&#xD;
      tests. Tests will be read by two independent readers and recorded. A third reader will be the&#xD;
      deciding vote for cases with discordant readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test data. Antibody test results (IgM and IgG) for each different test kit will be entered&#xD;
      into a test result form with the participant's unique identifier number (UI). Results will&#xD;
      later be merged into a database that contains the UI and metadata such as age, sex, fever,&#xD;
      cough, date sample was collected, date of symptom onset, exposure history (travel, household,&#xD;
      work). Acceptability of test performance will be judged according to a working target product&#xD;
      profile (TPP) appended at the end of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of tests for antibody to SARS-CoV-2, the virus&#xD;
      that causes COVID-19 disease. Separate criteria will be used to define sensitivity for acute&#xD;
      and convalescent samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sensitivity for diagnosis of acute cases will be defined as % positivity in samples from&#xD;
           symptomatic cases with positive RT-PCR results. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sensitivity for detecting antibody in convalescent samples expressed as % will be the&#xD;
           number of positive antibody tests divided by the number of samples tested from persons&#xD;
           with documented past infections (by RT-PCR) who are now at least 2 weeks past resolution&#xD;
           of symptoms and currently RT-PCR negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensitivity will also be defined as % agreement with results from a reference antibody&#xD;
           test as soon as one is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Specificity will be defined as the % of negative control samples (collected prior to&#xD;
           1/1/2020) that have negative antibody test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine relationships between the time after infection or onset of symptoms of&#xD;
           COVID-19 and the presence of antibodies to the virus as determined by antibody test&#xD;
           kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the duration of antibody responses following infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare background reactivity (false positive rates) for sera from the USA vs. sera&#xD;
           from developing countries in areas where chronic parasitic infections and consumption of&#xD;
           bushmeat are common or where people live in close relationship with wildlife that may be&#xD;
           a reservoir for zoonotic viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess test performance characteristics (ease of use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants. None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to society. Antibody tests may be useful for diagnosis of infection and for&#xD;
      documentation of past infection. Independent test validation studies are critically&#xD;
      important. That is because test results from companies may be biased. In addition, companies&#xD;
      often do not report on the user friendliness of rapid diagnostics. Antibody tests may be&#xD;
      especially valuable for use in low and middle income countries that lack resources for&#xD;
      widespread molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
