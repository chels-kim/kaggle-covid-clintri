      The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value for in-hospital mortality of&#xD;
      respectively the SOFA and Apache scores in a COVID-19 ICU cohort and to develop a new&#xD;
      prediction model for COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from 13th of March 2020 until 17th&#xD;
      of October 2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide. The&#xD;
      mortality of critical ill patients with COVID-19 has been reported variously as low as 11%&#xD;
      and as high as 61%. The application of scoring systems can facilitate the effective&#xD;
      evaluation by physicians to screen severe patients. At present, however, there are no&#xD;
      specific scoring systems for the evaluation of COVID-19 patients. Scoring systems such as the&#xD;
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score can help emergency or critical care&#xD;
      physicians for prognosis and predicting mortality. The SOFA score described the condition of&#xD;
      multiple organ dysfunction through several parameters, including oxygenation index, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure, Glasgow come scale, creatinine or urine volume, bilirubin, platelets for&#xD;
      the respiratory, circulatory, neurological, renal, hepatogenic and coagulation systems&#xD;
      respectively. The function of each organ system is scored from 0 to 4, and the individual&#xD;
      SOFA scores are summed to a total score. Although SOFA was not initially designed to predict&#xD;
      mortality, several studies reveal that SOFA could predict morbidity and mortality in severe&#xD;
      ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the SOFA score, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (Apache II) scores&#xD;
      was designed to measure the severity of disease of patients admitted to the ICU and to&#xD;
      predict mortality. The Apache II score is calculated based on physiological measurements such&#xD;
      as body temperature, mean arterial pressure, pH, heart and respiratory rate, Glasgow coma&#xD;
      scale, oxygenation and blood parameters such as sodium, potassium, creatinine, hematocrit and&#xD;
      white blood cell count. Recently, the Apache IV score is developed where additional&#xD;
      parameters such as admission information, admission diagnosis and chronic health conditions&#xD;
      were take into account.&#xD;
