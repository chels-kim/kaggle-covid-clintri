  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating the effects of an online single-session mental health intervention (the&#xD;
      Common Elements Toolbox; COMET). To evaluate COMET, we are conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with Indian college students. Students will be randomized to the COMET condition or to&#xD;
      a wait-list control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and subjective well-being)&#xD;
      will be measures at two weeks post-intervention, four weeks post-intervention, and twelve&#xD;
      weeks post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate COMET as a universal intervention (using the full sample) and as a targeted&#xD;
      intervention (analyzing those who reported elevated depressive symptoms or anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      at baseline).&#xD;

    <measure>Mechanisms of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants answered questions relating to each module's mechanism of change on a 7-point Likert Scale, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;.&#xD;
Specifically, we asked participants:&#xD;
How capable they feel about managing negative thoughts If they will intentionally spend time doing activities they enjoy If they will notice and appreciate good things</description>

    <measure>Ability to Cope with COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>2 questions related to their ability to cope with stressors over the upcoming weeks (including challenges relating to COVID-19). Participants answered these questions on a 7-point Likert Scale, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Specifically, we asked participants:&#xD;
if they will be able to handle lifestyle changes due to the coronavirus, if the pandemic will have an extremely negative impact on their life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We asked participants three items to assess secondary control (Weisz et al., 2010). The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;Very false&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very true&quot;).&#xD;
The three items are:&#xD;
When something bad happens, I can find a way to think about it that makes me feel better.&#xD;
After a really hard day, I can make myself feel better by remembering some good things that happened.&#xD;
When bad things happen to me that I can't control, there are lots of things I can do to feel better.&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater secondary control.</description>
