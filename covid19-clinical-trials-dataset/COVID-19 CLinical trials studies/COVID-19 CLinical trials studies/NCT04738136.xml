      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, Phase II proof of concept study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of S-1226 in which hospitalized subjects (nâ‰¤30) with&#xD;
      moderate severity COVID-19 Bronchiolitis/Pneumonia will be enrolled. The safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of S-1226 composed of PFOB with ascending doses of carbon dioxide (4%, 8%, and&#xD;
      12% CO2) administered twice daily will be assessed subjects in hospitalized subjects with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, Phase II proof of concept study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of S-1226 in which hospitalized subjects with moderate&#xD;
      severity COVID-19 Bronchiolitis/Pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-1226 contains a potent, safe and well-tolerated bronchodilator gas (extrinsic carbon&#xD;
      dioxide or CO2) and perflubron (PFOB), a synthetic surfactant that facilitates restoration of&#xD;
      surfactant function and mucus clearance. The inhaled S-1226 combination of gas, vapour and&#xD;
      liquid aerosol penetrates obstructed airways, resulting in rapid bronchodilation, enhanced&#xD;
      blood oxygenation, improved mucus clearance and reduction of work of breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-1226&#xD;
      composed of perflubron (PFOB) with ascending doses of carbon dioxide (4%, 8% and 12% CO2) in&#xD;
      hospitalized subjects with moderate severity COVID-19 bronchiolitis/pneumonia. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to establish proof of concept that S-1226 is effective in restoring lung&#xD;
      function in hospitalized subjects with moderate severity COVID-19 bronchiolitis/pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three parts: screening period, Dosing and evaluation, follow up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the screening period, subjects will undergo safety assessments and their&#xD;
           eligibility to participate will be confirmed. Eligible subjects will then be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to either the treatment arm (S-1226 + Standard of Care arm) or the&#xD;
           non-treatment arm (Standard of Care only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dosing and evaluation period will take place over 5 days of with two doses per day.&#xD;
           Subjects who are randomized to receive S-1226 will be started on a dose level of S-1226&#xD;
           (4%). If tolerated, subjects will progress from 4%, followed by 8%, and then 12%. The&#xD;
           highest tolerated dose will then be used for the remainder of the treatment period. All&#xD;
           doses incorporate 3mL PFOB and will be administered over a 3-4 minute treatment period.&#xD;
           Any enrolled subject randomized to receive S-1226 will not be required to interrupt any&#xD;
           SOC treatment which includes supplementary oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each S-1226 dose will be administered as inhaled gas &amp; vapour using a Circulaire II&#xD;
           hybrid system specifically adapted with the addition of an absolute aerosol filter&#xD;
           installed at the site of aerosol generation. This filter removes all perflubron aerosol&#xD;
           so that in this trial the S-1226 Gaseous Delivery System delivers an inhaled drug&#xD;
           comprising gas (CO2 in air) and vapour (perflubron). In addition, the S-1226 Gaseous&#xD;
           Delivery System includes a high efficiency bacterial/viral filter to scavenge any&#xD;
           patient-generated exhaled aerosol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow up Period will 28 days after the first dose of S1226 has been administered.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number and percent of treatment emergent adverse events will be monitored, recorded and graded for severity and assigned attribution. The severity will be assessed in the following manner:&#xD;
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but are easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type, causing no limitations of usual activities. Signs or symptoms may require minor action or additional therapy.&#xD;
Moderate: Discomfort severe enough to cause some limitations of usual activities and may require action or additional therapy.&#xD;
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to carry out usual activities and requires specific action and/or medical attention. Note: the term severe is not the same as &quot;serious&quot;, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.</description>
