      As of May 30th more than 23,000 cases of COVID -19 cases were confirmed in Egypt with total&#xD;
      deaths of 913. There are over six million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and almost 370,000&#xD;
      deaths globally. COVID-19 originated from Wuhan city, China in early 2020, from their&#xD;
      extending to the rest of the world. The virus belong to a large class of viruses known as&#xD;
      β-coronaviruses with a large number of potential natural primary, intermediate and final&#xD;
      hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped RNA&#xD;
      virus that typically spread by droplets causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 can result in cytokine storm, which in severe cases can lead to acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction that can progress to death.&#xD;
      Post SARS-CoV-2 entry, intense immune response against the virus with infiltration of&#xD;
      monocytes and macrophages into alveolar cells with decreasing number of lymphocytes in&#xD;
      peripheral blood along with reduced lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, hypercoagulability,&#xD;
      thrombosis and multiple organ damage. This along with the fact that some patients of this&#xD;
      disease have diarrhea points out towards a distinct possibility of involvement of gut-lung&#xD;
      axis and may be the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiota and immune homeostasis seem to have a back and forth relationship. Also,&#xD;
      gut microbiota derived signals are known to tune the immune cells for pro and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory responses thereby affecting the susceptibility to various diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many elderly and immune-compromised patients progress to serious adverse clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      it is therefore tempting to speculate that in COVID-19, there is a possible cross-talk taking&#xD;
      place between the lung and the gut microbiota which might influence the outcome of the&#xD;
      clinical manifestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy gut microbiome essentially could be pivotal in maintaining an optimal immune system&#xD;
      to prevent an array of excessive immune reactions that eventually become detrimental to lungs&#xD;
      and vital organ systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that increased D-dimer levels are associated with severe forms of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, this might be explained by diffuse alveolar damage, pneumocytes&#xD;
      desquamation, pulmonary edema, interstitial mononuclear cells and lymphocytes infiltration&#xD;
      causing intense inflammatory burden induced in severe COVID-19 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown that the patient's nutritional status have a significant effect&#xD;
      on an individual's immunity and over all health status and it has been suggested that&#xD;
      nutritional deficiencies may predispose to severe forms of COVID-19 infections. Adequate&#xD;
      Fruits and vegetables consumption have been studied for their potential protective effects&#xD;
      against respiratory diseases and anti-inflammatory effects, furthermore, fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables are also rich sources of fibers that have favorable effects on gut microbiome. One&#xD;
      of very familiar water-soluble vitamins; Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) , that can be found in&#xD;
      citrus fruits, barriers, leafy greens, tomatoes, and various other fruits and vegetables.&#xD;
      Indeed, 1-2 g supplementation of vitamin C was found to shorten the duration of common cold&#xD;
      by 18%, according to the United states National Institute of health (NIH) the recommended&#xD;
      daily allowances (RDA) of vitamin C for healthy adults is 75-90 mg/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sunshine vitamin (Vitamin D) which is found in mushrooms, eggs, salmon and milk was found&#xD;
      in a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trails conducted over more than 11,000&#xD;
      participants, an overall protective effect of vitamin D supplementation in acute respiratory&#xD;
      infections and, also, COVID-19, studies also suggested to possible role of Vitamin D as an&#xD;
      antiviral immunomodulator through anti-inflammatory properties, for this reason, Vitamin D&#xD;
      have been suggested to have a beneficial effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection (16), another&#xD;
      study done in Switzerland on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients found to have significant lower&#xD;
      levels (mean value 11.1 ng/mL) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The recommended RDA of vitamin D&#xD;
      according to NIH 15-20 ug/d (600-800 IU with tolerable upper limit of 4000 IU). Another&#xD;
      vitamin with anti-inflammatory benefits, fat soluble vitamin E (œ-tocopherol) found in seeds,&#xD;
      green leafy vegetables, nuts, and fortified cereals. Vitamin E has been labeled as&#xD;
      immunoenhancing vitamin by with anti-inflammatory properties by regulating the production of&#xD;
      Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) and modulating signal&#xD;
      transduction, thus protecting The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the cell membranes,&#xD;
      for this reason, it has been suggested that the combination of Vitamins C, D &amp; E may be&#xD;
      useful in COVID-19 patients. The RDA of Vitamin E for healthy adults according to the NIH is&#xD;
      15 mg/d (tolerable upper level 1000 mg/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding minerals, Zinc has been found to have a critical role in maintaining immune cells&#xD;
      integrity and important cofactor for numerous enzyme, zinc deficiency can cause impaired&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunity predisposing to various infections, especially respiratory infections,&#xD;
      available food sources of zinc including; meats, legumes and diary products, the RDA of zinc&#xD;
      according to NIH is 8-11 mg/d (with 40 mg/day tolerable upper intake level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another essential trace element is Copper that can be found in nuts and offal and, in lesser&#xD;
      concentrations in cereals and fruits, copper has a pivotal role in maintaining DNA integrity&#xD;
      by its antioxidant effects, studies have shown that adequate copper supplementation can&#xD;
      reduce lung inflammation in mice, according to NIH, the RDA of copper is 900 ug/d (tolerable&#xD;
      upper limit of 10 mg/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular intake of prebiotic foods such as oligosaccharides, fermentable fibers, and resistant&#xD;
      starches can beneficially affect the gut microbiota, prebiotic fibers are considered&#xD;
      selective substrates for specific beneficial colonic bacteria as they are neither hydrolyzed&#xD;
      nor absorbed in the proximal gut. Dietary fibers have been suggested as immunity modulators&#xD;
      as they lower incidence of bacterial translocation by maintaining integrity of the gut&#xD;
      barrier, available sources include; oat, barley, seeds, nuts, peas and some fruits, the&#xD;
      recommended daily intake is 25-38 g/day. Probiotic foods (from dairy products as yogurt&amp; sour&#xD;
      cream) and supplements have the ability to modify the gut microbiota and potentially modulate&#xD;
      gut inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product (FDP) that reflects bath thrombin production and&#xD;
      activation, elevated levels have been linked to increased risk of coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular strokes and total mortality, so far the link between dietary habits and&#xD;
      D-dimer levels has been poorly explored. Studies have reported, that adherence to a&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet was found to be associated with decreased levels of D-dimer, with possible&#xD;
      antithrombotic effects due to high content of fibers, antioxidants, mono and polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-existing non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in COVID-19 patients have been found to&#xD;
      delay patients recovery and worsen their prognosis, the reason may be due to aggravated&#xD;
      inflammatory pathology found in NCDs exacerbating COVID-19 infection. Such patients with&#xD;
      underlying cardiovascular, respiratory disease were found to have worse prognosis, diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are considered major risk factors for thrombotic&#xD;
      complications, which in COVID-19 patients may account for higher risk of serious disease&#xD;
      outcome and is associated with two-folds increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fish and fish oils are considered very beneficial to individual health especially in patients&#xD;
      with NCDs including cardiovascular diseases. Omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are&#xD;
      integral component of the cell membrane thus having anti-inflammatory effects, however,&#xD;
      substantial human trials in this area are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, an effective approach to reduce person's risk of developing NCDs is to halt&#xD;
      underlying inflammation via modifiable risk factors including; diet, exercise and healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle choices. To date, there is no single food or natural remedy that has been used for&#xD;
      preventing COVID-19 infections. Healthy diets containing adequate amounts of necessary macro&#xD;
      and micronutrients, prebiotics and probiotics that can maintain and restore immune system,&#xD;
      therefore increasing protection against chronic inflammation-related NCDs. Foods with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory compounds including essential vitamins (C, D &amp; E) and&#xD;
      minerals (Zinc, Copper, Calcium &amp; Selenium) are considered protective foods, these&#xD;
      micronutrients can act in harmony to prevent thrombotic and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#xD;
      complications by their anti-inflammatory properties. They are present in fair amounts in&#xD;
      Mediterranean Diet, which is characterized by increased dietary consumption of legumes, olive&#xD;
      oil, whole grains, nuts, and monounsaturated fats, minimally processed fruits, vegetables,&#xD;
      associated with low to moderate consumption of fermented dairy products, fish, poultry.&#xD;
      Antithrombotic advantages of Mediterranean diet have been explained by reduced levels of&#xD;
      factor VII, tissue factor, platelets and leucocytes counts in individuals consuming&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet. On the other hand, The &quot;Western&quot; dietary pattern, which is characterized&#xD;
      by high consumption of saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, red meat, deserts and sweets,&#xD;
      that may be associated with hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and chronic inflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the role dietary habits among COVID-19 Egyptian patients&#xD;
      and whether type of diet (Mediterranean or Western) will affect disease outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study also trying to determine if balanced diet maintaining healthy gut&#xD;
      microbiota can have a role in avoiding disease progression and deterioration in COVID-19&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
