  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and now&#xD;
      spreads across international borders. As of 11 April 2020, the total global number of&#xD;
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reached 1,521,252 (92,798 deaths); with 65,081 (7,978 deaths)&#xD;
      being reported in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is the name of the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and includes a&#xD;
      spectrum of illness that ranges from mild infection to severe pneumonia that can progress to&#xD;
      respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or septic shock. Between 8&#xD;
      to 15% (depending on geographical setting) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases can be classified&#xD;
      as severe or necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early stages of the outbreak unfolding, several retrospective case studies and cases&#xD;
      series carried out in China reported that those who died were more likely to be male, and&#xD;
      more likely to have underlying comorbidities. Prevalence studies conducted in the US and&#xD;
      Italy show similar trends in the distribution of comorbidities among SARS-CoV-2 severe cases;&#xD;
      adding obesity (BMI&gt;30) to the list of factors potentially associated with disease severity.&#xD;
      However, the relative importance of different underlying health conditions remains unclear&#xD;
      owing to inadequate adjustment for important confounding factors such as age, sex, and&#xD;
      smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a cohort study to evaluate predictors, clinical evolution and excess of mortality&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients, with two main workstreams- the first looking at all&#xD;
      patients admitted to SGHFT and the second looking at patients admitted to ITU with&#xD;
      respiratory failure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of published reports on early clinical descriptions of COVID-19 have emerged&#xD;
      from Hubei province in China, and although these provide valuable information, the lack of&#xD;
      standardised mortality and morbidity ratios hinders comparison of outcome experience across&#xD;
      populations. Also, most of the data available originate from descriptive cases or series that&#xD;
      do not account for confounding effect; so, as yet there are no specific data on how the risks&#xD;
      associated with underlying comorbidities might vary in different population groups or&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognition of risk factors for morbidity and mortality is important to determine prevention&#xD;
      strategies as well as to target high-risk populations for potential therapeutics. So, in this&#xD;
      study we aim to develop a predictive statistical model to identify baseline predictors of&#xD;
      mortality including underlying health conditions and biomarker levels at admission to improve&#xD;
      the understanding of the clinical evolution of patients with severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approximative 20-30% of regular admissions in the ICU are with respiratory failure. A&#xD;
      considerably higher number is expected in the current climate. Government policies have aimed&#xD;
      to flatten the epidemic curve to ease the pressure on the NHS to ensure as many people as&#xD;
      possible have access to the appropriate level of intensive care. However, even in the&#xD;
      best-case scenario, the number of people requiring level 3 care in ICU may be ten times the&#xD;
      current capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The excess of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in this population hasn't been fully assessed. It&#xD;
      is unknown if the evolution of this disease shares common characteristics with other&#xD;
      bacterial or viral infections. This information is invaluable in order to shape diagnostic&#xD;
      protocols, prevent complications and design therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
