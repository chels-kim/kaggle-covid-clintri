    <textblock>
      Doctors, nurses and staff members of ear-nose and throat (ENT) departments are at high risk&#xD;
      due to aerosol-inducing diagnostic procedures and surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic.&#xD;
      Reports from China, Spain, Italy and England report of fatal cases among ENT specialists.&#xD;
      With a concurrent lack of personal protection, it is of paramount importance to identify&#xD;
      patients and healthcare workers at an early stage to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in the&#xD;
      department. A baseline study of all healthcare workers has been performed. Follow-up will be&#xD;
      accomplished by interval testing, antibody measurements and REDcap Covid-19 questionnaires.&#xD;
      All patients at risk of carrying SARS-CoV-2, or who are candidates for high-risk airway&#xD;
      surgery will be tested. Infection control measures at the department will be implemented&#xD;
      progressively according to the real-time surveillance results from both patients and&#xD;
      healthcare workers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, and numbers of cases admitted to hospital and&#xD;
      case fatalities are on the rise in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 can pose a great burden on all healthcare systems at both national&#xD;
      and local level.Data from the SARS epidemic (2002-2003) showed that the countries with the&#xD;
      largest number of cases were China (including administrative regions), Canada and&#xD;
      Singapore.Healthcare workers accounted for 20%,43% and 41%, respectively of the total number&#xD;
      of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial stages of the current pandemic, Wuhan ear-nose and throat (ENT) doctors were&#xD;
      affected at higher rates than other doctors at the hospital (personal message from Stanford&#xD;
      University, confirmed in media). This has been acknowledged by the Confederation of European&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (CEORL HNS). A possible explanation is the close&#xD;
      contact with the patient's airway mucosa during routine ENT examinations, the risk of&#xD;
      inducing sneezing and coughing during these examinations and the use of nasal endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures among other airway procedures,at both examination and during surgery. Compared to&#xD;
      SARS, the new SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a higher viral load in the nasopharynx, posing&#xD;
      increased risk for ENT doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons who experience symptoms from the airways are in Denmark advised to stay at home, as&#xD;
      they may have COVID-19, and only contact the health care system if the situation&#xD;
      deteriorates. However, unspecific symptoms or complications in the upper airways, the oral&#xD;
      cavity, pharynx and neck can lead to contact with an ENT department, e.g. in case of symptoms&#xD;
      potentially related to cancer. Bacterial super infections as complications to viral airway&#xD;
      infections is seen during e.g. influenza epidemics. Acute bacterial middle ear infections is&#xD;
      one of the most common infections among children and is associated with virus in 80 % of&#xD;
      cases. Complications include acute mastoiditis, ethmoiditis and peritonsillar abscess,which&#xD;
      are potentially life-threatening conditions which need to be treated at a hospital ENT&#xD;
      department. It is not known if the incidence of these bacterial super infections will&#xD;
      increase during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or if such an increase will lead to a concurrent&#xD;
      increase in the exposure of virus to the healthcare workers within the ENT departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from asymptomatic, to complicated&#xD;
      pneumonias, to multi-organ failure and death. Studies have shown that 2/3 of patients with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 will have debut of symptoms from the upper airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protecting and monitoring healthcare workers and patients The mode of human transmission for&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 is not fully understood, but expected to be through direct contact and partly by&#xD;
      aerosol transmission, which is the reason for the health authorities' current advice of&#xD;
      keeping distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 can remain viable as aerosols for more than three hours, with a half-life of 1.1&#xD;
      hours and on plastic surfaces for up to 72 hours with a half-life of 6.8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virus has shown to be present in the oropharynx the first week after symptom onset with a&#xD;
      subsequent decline, but viral RNA has been detected up to 25 days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of personal protection including mask and gloves are essential for healthcare workers&#xD;
      treating patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, on March 3rd 2020 The World Health Organization announced global shortage of&#xD;
      personal protection supplies. In Denmark, there is also a current shortage of adequate&#xD;
      protection, which increases the risk for healthcare workers as the epidemic intensifies in&#xD;
      the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large scale population testing in Iceland indicates that half of individuals carrying&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic. With a concurrent lack of personal protection in a department&#xD;
      with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, it is important to identify infected patients and&#xD;
      infected healthcare workers at an early stage,in order to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak within&#xD;
      the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the Danish healthcare system was not prepared for an epidemic of this nature, detailed&#xD;
      guidelines to reduce transmission to healthcare workers at department level are deficient.&#xD;
      The department will progressively implement infection disease control measures based on&#xD;
      monitored real time data from the patient and healthcare worker surveillance. Control&#xD;
      measures will follow local guidelines and be inspired by recommendations from departments who&#xD;
      managed the SARS epidemic.&#xD;
