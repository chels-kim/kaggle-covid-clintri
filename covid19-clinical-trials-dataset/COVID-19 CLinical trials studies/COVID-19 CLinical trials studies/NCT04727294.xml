    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have been&#xD;
      impacted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a questionnaire to further understand how patients are being affected and&#xD;
      gather information in order to track the long-term effects of the coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of the questionnaire will include, COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, changes in&#xD;
      myeloma treatment and care, clinical trial familiarity, health and fitness, and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire is a follow-on to the &quot;MM and COVID-19&quot; questionnaire.&#xD;
