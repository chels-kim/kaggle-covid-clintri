      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known to cause Lung Injury that begins as dyspnea and exercise&#xD;
      intolerance, but may rapidly progress to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure and the&#xD;
      need for noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. Mortality rates as high as 80% have been&#xD;
      reported among those who require mechanical ventilation, despite best available intensive&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed&#xD;
      respiratory failure be treated with nebulized RLF-100 (aviptadil, a synthetic version of&#xD;
      Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP)) 100 μg 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo +&#xD;
      Standard of Care using an FDA 501(k) cleared mesh nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be progression to in severity of COVID-19 (i.e. moderate progressing&#xD;
      to to severe or critical OR severe progressing to critical) over 28 days. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attack of the Alveolar Type II (ATII) cell via its ACE2 surface receptor by the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      virus leads to respiratory failure, morbidity, and frequently mortality in COVID-19. There is&#xD;
      no approved treatment that specifically targets the pulmonary injury. Vasoactive Intestinal&#xD;
      Peptide (VIP) is known to target the VPAC1 receptor of the ATII cell and to protect that cell&#xD;
      against all manner of injuries, including smoke inhalation, exposure to stomach acid, and&#xD;
      exposure to infectious agents. VIP prevents apoptosis, blocks cytokines, lowers TNFα levels,&#xD;
      reverses CD4/CD8 ratio, and reduces cough and dyspnea in nonclinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
      Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA&#xD;
      Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Pulmonary Hypertension and EMEA Orphan&#xD;
      Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Sarcoid. RLF-100 (Aviptadil) has been granted&#xD;
      FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of ARDS/Acute Lung Injury in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to identify patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 who&#xD;
      have not yet developed respiratory failure and to treat them with inhaled Vasoactive&#xD;
      Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) in the hope of preventing progression to Critical COVID-19 with&#xD;
      Respiratory Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is 70% concentrated in the lung, where it binds&#xD;
      primarily to ATII cells. VIP prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits&#xD;
      IL6 and TNFα production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other&#xD;
      effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats,&#xD;
      guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at&#xD;
      the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intravenous and inhalation preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology have been&#xD;
      performed in four species, with a six month trial of inhaled RLF-100 in primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of&#xD;
      safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile&#xD;
      Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS&#xD;
      on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients&#xD;
      were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital&#xD;
      and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five GCP phase 2 trials of RLF-100 have been conducted under European regulatory authority.&#xD;
      Non GCP healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well&#xD;
      tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or&#xD;
      ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded&#xD;
      basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores&#xD;
      function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have&#xD;
      not developed respiratory failure be treated with nebulized RLF-100 100 μg 3x daily plus&#xD;
      Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501(k) cleared mesh nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be progression to in severity of COVID-19 (i.e. moderate progressing&#xD;
      to to severe or critical OR severe progressing to critical) over 28 days. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines.&#xD;
