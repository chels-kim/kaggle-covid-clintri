    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The&#xD;
      first batch of COVID-19 patients were found in December 2019 (1). The disease is mainly&#xD;
      transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact, and all people are susceptible to&#xD;
      it (2). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious (3), and has quickly spread to most countries and&#xD;
      regions of the world. COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and has received great attention&#xD;
      from all over the world (4, 5). Till April 7, 2020, 1,214,466 confirmed cases of COVID-19&#xD;
      have been found in 211 countries and regions, causing 67,767 deaths (6). The main clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of COVID-19 are cough, fever, malaise, chest distress and tachypnia and&#xD;
      complications such acute respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on front line of treating patients infected with COVID-19.&#xD;
      However, data related to infection rate among HCWs are limited. Early available evidence&#xD;
      suggested that HCWs are being increasingly infected with the novel infection ranging from 15%&#xD;
      to 18% and in some cases up to 20% of the infected population. Major risk factors of&#xD;
      infection among HCWs include lack of understanding of the disease, inadequate use and&#xD;
      availability personal Protective Equipment (PPE), uncertain diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
      unavailability of diagnostic tests and psychological stress. Therefore the protection of HCWs&#xD;
      by authorities should be prioritized through education and training, the readiness of staff,&#xD;
      incentives, availability of PPEs, and psychological support. In this time of COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, big problem in hospitals that are flooded with infected symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients. A critical aspect is the protection of the HCWs who are at risk,&#xD;
      including individuals more than 50 years old those with presence of a systemic disease,&#xD;
      smokers and disabled individuals. These HCWs should be identified and not assigned duties&#xD;
      inwards and premises managing COVID 19 patients&#xD;
