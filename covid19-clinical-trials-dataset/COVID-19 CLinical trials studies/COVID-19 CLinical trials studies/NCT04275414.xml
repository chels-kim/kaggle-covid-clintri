    <textblock>
      The novel identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 causes an nationwide outbreak as well&#xD;
      as public health crisis in China, and expands globally. Pulmonary edema is one of the most&#xD;
      detrimental symptoms and usually presents in severe and critical coronavirus disease&#xD;
      (COVID-19), resulting in dyspnea, acute lung injury (ALI) ,acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Recent evidence revealed higher levels of blood Vascular&#xD;
      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. VEGF is&#xD;
      considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Numerous studies have revealed&#xD;
      that VEGF was a key factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALI and ARDS. Bevacizumab,&#xD;
      an anti-VEGF drug, approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical&#xD;
      oncotherapy, is a promising drug for ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 through suppression of pulmonary&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a new identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, causes public&#xD;
      health crisis in China and spreads worldwide. On February 11,2020, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus &quot;COVID-19&quot;. The&#xD;
      Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its&#xD;
      outbreak. Meanwhile, five editions of &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected&#xD;
      Pneumonia&quot; has been timely and continuously issued, which play extremely important roles in&#xD;
      guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and&#xD;
      dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to&#xD;
      severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia&#xD;
      hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even&#xD;
      ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular&#xD;
      permeability inducers. Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      compared with healthy controls. The rise of VEGF levels may be caused by hypoxia, severe&#xD;
      inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium itself. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have confirmed a key role of VEGF as potential therapeutic target in acute lung&#xD;
      injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due do increase vascular&#xD;
      permeability and induce pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF medication, may offer a unique approach to treat ALI/ARDS&#xD;
      caused by COVID-19. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with long half-life. It&#xD;
      has been approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy,&#xD;
      with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics having been widely understood. Therefore,&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI/ARDS as well as reduction of&#xD;
      mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients through suppression of pulmonary edema.&#xD;
