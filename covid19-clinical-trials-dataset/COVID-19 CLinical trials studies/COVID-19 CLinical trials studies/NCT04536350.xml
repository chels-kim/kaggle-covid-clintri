  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world is currently experiencing a coronavirus (CoV-2) pandemic. A new (SARS)-CoV&#xD;
      infection epidemic began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in late 2019; originally called 2019- nCoV&#xD;
      the virus is now known as SARSCoV- 2 and the disease it causes COVID-19. Previous CoV&#xD;
      epidemics included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, which started in China in&#xD;
      2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in the Middle East, which started in&#xD;
      2012. The mortality rates were &gt;10% for SARS and &gt;35% for MERS. The direct cause of death is&#xD;
      generally due to ensuing severe atypical pneumonia and ensuing acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS). Pneumonia also is generally the cause of death for people who develop&#xD;
      influenza, although the mortality rate is lower (1%-3% for the influenza A H5N1 pandemic of&#xD;
      1918-1919 in the United States). Risk factors for a poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection have&#xD;
      so far been found to include older age and co-morbidities including chronic cardiovascular&#xD;
      and respiratory conditions and current smoking status. In May 2020, the FDA authorized the&#xD;
      emergency use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 disease based on topline date of two&#xD;
      clinical trials, even though an underpowered clinical trial did not find significant&#xD;
      improvement in COVID- 19 patients treated with remdesivir. Nevertheless, remdesivir is the&#xD;
      first and so far, only approved treatment for COVID-19. Additionally further trials and&#xD;
      clinical observations have not found a significant benefit of other antiviral drugs. Although&#xD;
      the results of several studies are still pending, there is still a desperate need for an&#xD;
      effective, safe treatment for COVID-19. Aviptadil, which is a synthetic form of Human&#xD;
      Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), might be beneficial in patients at risk of&#xD;
      developing ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung,&#xD;
      where it reduces inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 20% of individuals with Corona Virus disease (COVID-19) experience more severe disease&#xD;
      characterized by significant respiratory symptoms including acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a known lethal complication due to its low blood oxygenation levels&#xD;
      and may result in organ failure. Until now, there are no specific vaccines or therapeutic&#xD;
      drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapeutic interventions are needed to prevent and&#xD;
      ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19 to effectively reduce mortality&#xD;
      and prevent ICU admissions. Aviptadil, which is a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive&#xD;
      Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), might be beneficial in patients at risk of developing ARDS.&#xD;
      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it&#xD;
      prevents N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced caspase-3 activation, inhibits IL-6 and TNFa&#xD;
      production and protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema. Further, in animal model systems&#xD;
      of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine and dogs, Aviptadil was shown to&#xD;
      restore barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and to protect the lung and&#xD;
      other organs from failure. In Europe, Aviptadil is approved for human use and has been shown&#xD;
      to be safe in phase II trials for sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchospasm, erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction as well as in a phase I trial in ARDS in the past two decades. In the US, VIP has&#xD;
      been given FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and was admitted to the FDA&#xD;
      Corona Virus Technology Accelerator Program. In a phase I trial of Aviptadil performed by&#xD;
      Sami Said in the early 2000s, eight patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were&#xD;
      treated with ascending doses of intravenous VIP. Seven patients (88%) were successfully&#xD;
      extubated and were alive at the five day time point. Six (75%) left the hospital and one&#xD;
      (13%) died of an unrelated cardiac event. A phase II clinical trial using intravenous&#xD;
      Aviptadil in patients with COVID-19 infection and ARDS has begun. Further, a phase II/III&#xD;
      clinical trial will study the effect of inhaled Aviptadil for the treatment of non-acute lung&#xD;
      injury in COVID- 19 and begins in June 2020. In Europe, two phase II trials of Aviptadil have&#xD;
      been conducted. Further, studies with healthy volunteers have shown that inhaled Aviptadil is&#xD;
      well tolerated with few adverse effects.&#xD;
