      Note that this is a study that is co-sponsored by Medecins Sans Frontieres, Spain, and the&#xD;
      University of Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to identify clinical and biochemical prognostic&#xD;
      markers in adults with virologically confirmed COVID-19 who do not require oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation, with a focus on: aiding safe discharge from a healthcare facility (i.e. a&#xD;
      high NPV); near-term impact on COVID-19 interventions in resource-limited settings (i.e.&#xD;
      simple clinico-demographic variables and biochemical markers for which near-patient / POCTs&#xD;
      are commercially available or in late-stage development).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the field-based performance of&#xD;
      near-patient lateral flow assays for suPAR and IL-6 in adults with non-severe SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of writing the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 11 million&#xD;
      individuals and killed more than 500,000. The most recent epidemiological surveillance curve&#xD;
      shows that the number of new infections continues to rise, with over 230,000 new cases&#xD;
      reported in the last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the absolute number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 is substantial, effectively&#xD;
      managing high patient volumes is also a major challenge facing health systems, particularly&#xD;
      in under-resourced settings. With an estimated case-fatality rate amongst symptomatic&#xD;
      patients of between 1-2%, it is vitally important that health workers are able to accurately&#xD;
      identify the majority of patients at low risk for progression to severe disease. These&#xD;
      patients can be safely discharged away from the health facility ensuring the available&#xD;
      resources are allocated to patients most likely to benefit. If low-risk patients cannot be&#xD;
      readily identified, there is a real risk that health facilities in these regions will be&#xD;
      overrun, with consequent substantial avoidable mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 has already started to hit extremely vulnerable populations in refugee camps and&#xD;
      conflict areas. In Bangladesh, cases within the Rohingya refugee megacamps have already been&#xD;
      reported, and local transmission is ongoing. Such contexts already suffer from a lack of&#xD;
      medical facilities and even a moderate number of COVID-19 cases will overburden existing, and&#xD;
      proposed, capacity. Having the ability to prognosticate the need for supplemental oxygen (the&#xD;
      main treatment available in these settings) through measurement of parameters available at&#xD;
      the time of arrival at a healthcare facility would strengthen the capability to identify&#xD;
      those patients presenting with moderate symptoms that can be safely discharged away from the&#xD;
      facility. Based on recent estimates, only 20% of all symptomatic patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      develop a requirement for supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although existing prognostic scores have yielded disappointing results in patients with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection a number of demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters are&#xD;
      associated with a more severe disease course and worse patient outcomes. However, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, few studies have examined the performance of prognostic markers in patients who do&#xD;
      not require supplemental oxygen at presentation. Only one of these studies included&#xD;
      outpatient or ambulatory care settings and none were conducted in resource-limited settings.&#xD;
      Hence, whether measurement of these parameters can inform the decision to safely discharge a&#xD;
      patient away from a health facility is as yet unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults presenting to care with non-severe COVID-19, can subsequent need for oxygen be&#xD;
      predicted from parameters measured at the time of arrival at a healthcare facility?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate several clinical and biochemical biomarkers that have been&#xD;
      identified as possible predictors of deterioration in patients with COVID-19. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to develop a prognostic tool combining up to four markers (including a maximum&#xD;
      of two biochemical markers) with a high negative predictive value (NPV) for subsequent&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen requirement (WHO Grade ≥ 5). Clinical biomarkers will be limited to&#xD;
      simple clinico-demographic variables (for example, age, sex and duration of symptoms) in&#xD;
      order to ensure the tool remains as simple as possible. Biochemical biomarkers for which&#xD;
      point-of-care (POC) and/or near-patient tests are either already commercially available or in&#xD;
      late-stage development have been prioritised, in order to maximise the chance of translation&#xD;
      on to the field within a time period that is useful for the current global pandemic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirement for supplemental oxygen has been selected as the primary outcome: it is a&#xD;
      relatively objective endpoint (based either on the measurement of peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation [sO2 ≤ 93%] or a respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths per minute or a clinical decision&#xD;
      to give supplemental oxygen) and from a practical perspective is the main evidence-based&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention available in such settings, but in very limited supply in the&#xD;
      majority of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified near-patient tests for two of the priority biochemical biomarkers that&#xD;
      have not yet been field-evaluated in LMICs (IL-6 and suPAR). We will evaluate the performance&#xD;
      of these tests under field conditions. We have selected these tests for evaluation because&#xD;
      unlike the other potential markers for which near-patient tests also exist, there is a&#xD;
      relative paucity of field experience in tropical settings. As all biochemical markers&#xD;
      (including suPAR and IL-6) will be measured using a validated multi-analyte quantitative&#xD;
      immunoassay (using the Ella platform), this study will provide an opportunity to evaluate the&#xD;
      field performance of these tests. If either of the markers is found to be useful&#xD;
      prognosticators for patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, this may facilitate a more&#xD;
      rapid translation of the results of this study into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions, limitations, and generalisability&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main assumption that underlies this work is that a validated, rapid, low-cost&#xD;
      antigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 will become available in the near future. There is reason&#xD;
      to believe that this will be the case.Availability of such a test would allow the prognostic&#xD;
      tool developed in this study to be applied to the appropriate patient population at the point&#xD;
      of arrival at a health facility. Whilst the absence of such a test would undoubtedly limit&#xD;
      the utility of the tool, it is likely that when local incidence of patients presenting with&#xD;
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds a threshold, use of the tool could be justified based&#xD;
      upon a clinical case definition alone. Furthermore, in order to mitigate this risk, we plan&#xD;
      to use the data collected in this study (specifically the baseline and outcome data collected&#xD;
      from participants who are subsequently confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR) to&#xD;
      inform exploratory simulation analyses, with the aim of customizing of the tool for use in&#xD;
      different prevalence settings, thereby extending utility to different phases of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional limitation of this study is that due to its single-site nature we will not be&#xD;
      able to explore whether the performance of the prognostic markers is impacted by different&#xD;
      host populations, or perform an external geographic validation of the prognostic model. To&#xD;
      mitigate this risk we have designed a pragmatic study that could be implemented in other&#xD;
      sites. We are actively exploring options for conducting the study at other sites if&#xD;
      sufficient additional funding can be identified. We will inform and seek approval from all&#xD;
      relevant regulatory bodies (international and local) prior to the inclusion of any additional&#xD;
      study sites.&#xD;
