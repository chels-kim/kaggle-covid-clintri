      A randomized, double-blind, single-dose by intravenous administration, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      dose escalation, first-in-human study is proposed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of HLX71 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Investigators plan to enroll 10 subjects in each of the 4 dose cohorts at 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/&#xD;
      kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, of which 2 receive intravenous injections of placebo and 8 receive&#xD;
      intravenous injections of the investigational product (IP). A total of 40 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
