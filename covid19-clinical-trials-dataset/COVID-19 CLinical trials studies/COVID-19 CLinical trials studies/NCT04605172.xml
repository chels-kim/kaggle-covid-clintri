  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labor (PL) is the leading cause of hospitalization during pregnancy and premature&#xD;
      birth the leading cause of fetal morbidity and mortality in France. PL is defined by regular&#xD;
      and painful uterine contractions associated with a change in the cervix, between 22 and 36&#xD;
      weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that the risk of spontaneous prematurity increases particularly in case of&#xD;
      working over 40 hours per week, hard physically conditions, or prolonged daily transport&#xD;
      time. Rest is one of the most efficient measure to prevent PL and should be proposed to all&#xD;
      pregnant women, and combined with other therapies such as tocolysis or cerclage when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very particular period of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic had pregnant women to&#xD;
      drastically reduce their activity. They suspended their work and stayed home for various&#xD;
      reasons such as pregnancy in progress, children at home, and also collective reasons such as&#xD;
      teleworking or workplace closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the lockdown period from March 17th to May 11th 2020, fewer preterm labor and less&#xD;
      spontaneous prematurity have been suspected by the neonatology and obstetrics teams&#xD;
      throughout the Lorraine region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to objectively confirm this observation. In this investigation we aim to find&#xD;
      a relationship between lockdown, PL and spontaneous prematurity which would need to&#xD;
      re-evaluate public health recommendations for pregnant women outside the lockdown.&#xD;
