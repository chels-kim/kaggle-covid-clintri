  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic put tremendous pressures on the public health system and the health&#xD;
      workers in almost every country around the world. Egypt was no exception, one of the main&#xD;
      challenges faced is the limited number of CPR centers, equipment and kits which consequently&#xD;
      affecting the number of tests that could be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although testing is critical, clinical judgement is the first mean to evaluate patients for&#xD;
      COVID-19. Ancillary Diagnostic Tests and Chest imaging are also important tools before&#xD;
      proceeding to the PCR testing. However, important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic&#xD;
      persons in the incubation phase, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral&#xD;
      shedding during convalescence to inform decisions to end isolation. The main objectives of&#xD;
      the study: To set an evidence-based protocol with some criteria and procedures to reach - as&#xD;
      accurate as possible - diagnosis without compromising the limited available resources. Such&#xD;
      protocol shall make full use of the three main traditional pillars: Clinical picture,&#xD;
      Ancillary Diagnostic Tests and Chest imaging before proceeding to the PCR testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Picture: Symptomatic COVID-19 presents with a recognizable clinical syndrome&#xD;
           that is predictable prior to testing. Clinical judgement remains important, particularly&#xD;
           when interpreting negative test results;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarkers Associated with COVID-19 Patients: The most common laboratory features&#xD;
           reported in patients with COVID-19 include: • Decreased albumin; • Elevated C-reactive&#xD;
           protein ; • Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels ; and • Lymphopenia .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other biomarkers that have been reported include increased erythrocyte sedimentation&#xD;
           rates; elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine&#xD;
           kinase levels, leukopenia, leukocytosis, increased bilirubin and creatinine levels. No&#xD;
           biomarker or combination of biomarkers currently exists that is sensitive or specific&#xD;
           enough to establish a diagnosis of COVID-19, or to pragmatically predict its clinical&#xD;
           course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Radiographic Tests: Many centers have evaluated the utility of chest imaging for&#xD;
           diagnosis: • On chest radiography, bilateral pneumonia is the most frequently reported&#xD;
           feature (range,11.8% to 100%) and is more common than a unilateral focus; • Computed&#xD;
           tomography is regarded as more sensitive than radiography, with several cohort studies&#xD;
           reporting that most patients (77.8% to 100%) had ground glass opacities. Other features&#xD;
           commonly reported with COVID-19 on chest computed tomography include a peripheral&#xD;
           distribution, fine reticular opacities, and vascular thickening. Compared with serial&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal sampling, chest computed tomography may be more sensitive than an RT-PCR&#xD;
           test at a single time point for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, artificial&#xD;
           intelligence may help distinguish COVID-19 from other etiologic agents of&#xD;
           community-acquired pneumonia. However, these findings are not completely specific to&#xD;
           COVID-19 and do not exclude a co-infection or an alternative diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPR: Who Should Be Tested? The current situation exemplifies the challenge of how to best&#xD;
      utilize testing during outbreaks of novel pathogens. The initial testing criteria were too&#xD;
      narrow to monitor and control the spread of the disease, but the sudden pivot to a far&#xD;
      broader testing approach, even as capacity remains limited, may be an overcorrection. As of&#xD;
      March 4, CDC discontinued specific guidance and recommends that &quot;clinicians should use their&#xD;
      judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      whether the patient should be tested,&quot; advising that &quot;decisions on which patients receive&#xD;
      testing should be based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the clinical course&#xD;
      of illness.&quot; High priorities for testing include patients with serious, unexplained&#xD;
      respiratory illness and contacts of known cases, Methods: It is a comparative study between&#xD;
      tests to diagnose COVID-19. In developed countries (in which Egypt is one of them) PCR is&#xD;
      high cost. Though much of cases escape Diagnosis and clinician depend on clinical picture&#xD;
      only. This study would allow to find what degree of dependence on other tests. In this study,&#xD;
      100 cases positive COVID-19 by PCR will be analyzed and tested for other ancillary tests and&#xD;
      CT chest to compare them and find out which is the most sensitive in both moderate and severe&#xD;
      clinical condition.&#xD;
