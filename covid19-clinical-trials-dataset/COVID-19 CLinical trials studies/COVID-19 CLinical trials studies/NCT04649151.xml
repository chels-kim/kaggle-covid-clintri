    <textblock>
      The mRNA-1273 vaccine is being developed to prevent COVID-19, the disease resulting from&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study is designed&#xD;
      to primarily evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose level of mRNA-1273&#xD;
      vaccine administered in 2 doses 28 days apart to an adolescent population.&#xD;

             medical history and screening physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator assessment that the participant, in the case of an emancipated minor, or&#xD;
             parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) [LAR(s)] understand and is willing and&#xD;
             physically able to comply with protocol-mandated follow up, including all procedures&#xD;
             and provides written informed consent/assent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the&#xD;
             participant has a negative pregnancy test at Screening (Day 0), on the day of the&#xD;
             first injection (Day 1), and on the day of the second injection (Day 29); has&#xD;
             practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that could&#xD;
             result in pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first injection (Day 1); has&#xD;
             agreed to continue adequate contraception through 3 months following the second&#xD;
             injection (Day 29); and is not currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or known close contact with anyone with&#xD;
             laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 within 2 weeks prior to vaccine&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Travel outside of the United States in the 28 days prior to the Screening Visit (Day&#xD;

             this criterion may have visits rescheduled within the relevant study visit windows.&#xD;
             Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be enrolled at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of an investigational coronavirus (for example, SARS-CoV, Middle&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of a diagnosis or condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may&#xD;
             affect study endpoint assessment or compromise participant safety, specifically:&#xD;
