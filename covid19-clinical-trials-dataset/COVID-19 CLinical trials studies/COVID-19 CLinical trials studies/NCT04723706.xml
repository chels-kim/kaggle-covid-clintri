  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many patients with hematologic disorders and bone marrow failure, hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) or cellular therapy (CART) offers a curative treatment option.&#xD;
      Patients after SCT or CART have a variable period of immune deficiency in the post-treatment&#xD;
      period. The response to vaccination may affect the outcome of the transplant patients. the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of vaccines in this immunosuppressed population is uncertain and variable.&#xD;
      HSCT and CAR-T recipients are in a COVID-19 high-risk group and conferring immunity by&#xD;
      vaccination at the earliest effective timepoint is desirable. At present, the immunogenicity&#xD;
      and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in immune-impaired patients including autologous and&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT recipients is unknown. Furthermore, the impact of GvHD and IST on SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      vaccine immunogenicity is unknown. the investigators aim to evaluate the vaccination response&#xD;
      to COVID vaccines after SCT and CART&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      so for participants with SCT or CART who decide to get their vaccines, the investigators will&#xD;
      measure response by therapy by measuring COVID-19 serology IgG at the following schedule:&#xD;
      Baseline +5 days after vaccination; 1 month +/- 10 days (after the first dose), 2 months +/-&#xD;
      10 days (after the 2nd dose), 3 months +/- 10 days, 6 months +/- 10 days and 12 months +/- 10&#xD;
      days In addition, also the investigators will collect CD4 and Total IgG which is the standard&#xD;
      of care of these patients post SCT and CART&#xD;
