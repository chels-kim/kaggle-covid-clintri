  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Italy there are about 5000 patients with dependent transfusion thalassemia (source Italian&#xD;
      Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathies - SITE) and a smaller number, currently not definable, of&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell anemia in chronic transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in the Lombardy region identified the positivity of anti-Covid-19 antibodies&#xD;
      in 4.5-7% of asymptomatic donors (Valenti L et al). As already known, a preliminary study&#xD;
      conducted in Italy (Motta I et al, Hussain FA et al, Taher A et al) reported only 11 cases of&#xD;
      symptomatic infection all with benign evolution. Currently there are 15 reported cases (12&#xD;
      thalassemias and 3 sickle cell anemias). 75% of the cases have been identified in Lombardy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that in a percentage of polytransfused patients a transmission of the virus&#xD;
      may have developed that stimulated the production of protective antibodies. This could be an&#xD;
      explanation of the low contagiousness and severity of the infection in polytransfused&#xD;
      patients. Currently no data are available for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in collaboration with the Microbiology Unit and involves the&#xD;
      determination of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (anti-s1 and s2) by CLIA method with a high&#xD;
      sensitivity (94.7%) and specificity (98.5%).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION In Italy there are about 5000 patients with dependent transfusion thalassemia&#xD;
      (source Italian Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathies - SITE) and a smaller number, currently&#xD;
      not definable, of patients with sickle cell anemia in chronic transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients, as patients with chronic diseases, many of which also splenectomized, are&#xD;
      generally considered to be at greater risk of infection and complications in the event of an&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, preliminary studies in patients with thalassemia and sickle cell anemia do not seem&#xD;
      to confirm these assumptions about the COVID-19 pandemic (Motta I et al, Hussain FA et al,&#xD;
      Taher A et al). On the basis of these data, it was hypothesized that the chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      background, the hemolytic and anemic status of these patients could have a favorable and&#xD;
      protective influence on the risk of fatal COVID-19 infections (Roy NBA et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in the Milan area identified the positivity of anti-Covid-19 antibodies in&#xD;
      4.4-10.8% of asymptomatic donors (Valenti L et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGETS In this study, the presence of COVID-19 IgG antibodies will be assessed in all&#xD;
      transfusion dependent patients affected by thalassemia, Blackfan-Diamond anemia, sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia and other chronic anemias, related to the ASST-Monza Rare Disease Center, S. Gerardo&#xD;
      and all residents in the provinces of Monza-Brianza, Como, Lecco, Varese and Milan. Of these&#xD;
      patients, 15% experienced potentially suspect symptoms of infection, albeit mildly overall,&#xD;
      but only 5 patients performed the nasal swab which tested positive in one case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study should be considered as a pilot and preliminary study since no data are available.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to define the transfusion risk as a source of contact with the virus&#xD;
      in patients subject to multiple transfusions (every 2-3 weeks for a total of about 300 units&#xD;
      of blood used per month). Based on the results, further information on the exposure of these&#xD;
      patients to COVID-19 infection may be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a study with use of biological material. All patients suffering from&#xD;
      hereditary transfusion anemias or who have undergone recurrent transfusion procedures&#xD;
      belonging to the Rare Disease Center of ASST Monza will be enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study when consent is obtained. A serum sample will be&#xD;
      analyzed for anti-COVID-19 antibodies and if the result is positive, the nasal swab will be&#xD;
      performed. If the outcome of the swab is positive, the patient must undergo quarantine and&#xD;
      follow the national protocol. Only demographic data will be collected and only the value of&#xD;
      antibodies to COVID-19 as biochemical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Serological test is based on the identification of COVID-19 antibodies (anti-s1 and&#xD;
      -s2) by CLIA method. It has a high sensitivity (97.4%) and specificity (98.%). Although the&#xD;
      test has a high concordance value (&gt; 95%), it is not possible to consider if the positive&#xD;
      subjects have neutralizing antibodies for the virus. In the case of a positive test, the&#xD;
      molecular test for diagnostic confirmation is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be carried out at the ASST-Monza Microbiology Laboratory - S. Gerardo&#xD;
      Hospital (Primary: Dr. Annalisa Cavallero) and an aliquot of serum will be kept at the&#xD;
      Cytogenetics and Medical Genetics Laboratory for 1 year after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS Based on the few data available in Italy, the investigator foresees 5-10% of&#xD;
      positive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All 81 transfusion dependent patients belonging to the&#xD;
      Rare Disease Center of ASST-Monza, S. Gerardo Hospital will be included in the study and for&#xD;
      this reason a formal calculation of sample size has not been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be substantially descriptive and it will use appropriate&#xD;
      central tendency and dispersion measures for quantitative variables, while absolute and&#xD;
      relative frequencies will be used for qualitative variables. The estimates of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint relating to the percentage of transfusion-dependent patients tested positive will be&#xD;
      reported with their respective 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
