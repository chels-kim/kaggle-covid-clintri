  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic, and development&#xD;
      of safe, effective vaccines is mandatory to return back to pre pandemic life. Many vaccines&#xD;
      have been developed and requested by the authorities after the emergency license issued. The&#xD;
      main mechanism of protection is through humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that might&#xD;
      reduce the potential for disease development or severity. Cytotoxic T cells clear&#xD;
      virus-infected host cells and contribute to control of infection. Preliminary data are now&#xD;
      available indicating safty and effecacy of different vaccines . The vaccines were tolerated,&#xD;
      with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      spike protein. The aim of this work is to evaluate the immune responses in adults, aged 25-65&#xD;
      years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single and double doses live inactivated&#xD;
      (Sinopharm), mRNA (Pfizer/ Biontech) and viral vector (Oxford/AZ- ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccines.&#xD;
      The Th1- response ( interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine secretion by CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells) and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses as well as CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells mono, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, will be also measured.&#xD;
