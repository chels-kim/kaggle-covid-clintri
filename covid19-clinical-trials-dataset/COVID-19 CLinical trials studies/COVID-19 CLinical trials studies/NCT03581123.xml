  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective is to reduce overall low back pain (LBP) burden by testing scalable,&#xD;
      first-line, non-pharmacologic strategies that address the biopsychosocial aspects of&#xD;
      acute/sub-acute LBP and prevent transition to chronic back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US is in the midst of an unprecedented pain management crisis. LBP is the most common&#xD;
      chronic pain condition in adults and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Guidelines&#xD;
      have recommended non-pharmacologic treatments like spinal manipulation and behavioral&#xD;
      approaches for LBP for nearly a decade, yet uptake and adherence has been poor. Moreover,&#xD;
      little is known about the role of these treatments in the secondary prevention of chronic LBP&#xD;
      (cLBP), especially for patients with biopsychosocial risk factors. With burgeoning costs,&#xD;
      mounting evidence of ineffectiveness, and harms of commonly used drug treatments, including&#xD;
      opioids, there is a critical need for research on non-pharmacological treatments for cLBP&#xD;
      prevention that can be readily translated to practice.&#xD;
