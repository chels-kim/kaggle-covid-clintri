  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective nationwide cohort study of pregnant women enrolled early in gestation and&#xD;
      followed for Covid-19 exposure and infection, with follow up of obstetrical outcomes and&#xD;
      infant development through the first year of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASPIRE is focused on the first trimester, a critical and vulnerable period when all of a&#xD;
      baby's organ systems form and the placenta - the crucial connection between mom and baby -&#xD;
      develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no data about the effects of COVID-19 infections in the first trimester.&#xD;
      The study will provide critical information to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Guide the care of pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Protect the safety of their babies and families&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Help those considering pregnancy in the future understand what it means to be pregnant&#xD;
           in this new era&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are recruiting 10,000 women from the start of pregnancy and will track&#xD;
      COVID-19 exposures using frequent serology testing. The investigators will collect&#xD;
      information during and after the pregnancy to try to determine the effects of COVID 19 for&#xD;
      mom and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to do the following throughout pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Submit frequent, quick (&lt;1 minute each) symptom tracking reports using your mobile phone&#xD;
           and/or computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect finger-stick blood samples from home at several points throughout your&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give permission to review medical records related to your pregnancy, delivery and baby's&#xD;
           development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete questionnaires online about your health during your pregnancy and after&#xD;
           delivery of your baby.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout pregnancy in women</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout pregnancy in women whose pregnancy was documented at a SART member clinic in the United States between November 2019-December 2020. The investigators will use patient-reported information on infection symptoms as well as serological testing to capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Deliverable: By instituting the first prospectively tracked U.S.-based pregnancy cohort with precisely timed conception, the investigators will provide foundational, urgent data regarding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection at varying gestational ages, across the real-time evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the setting of various public health measures to reduce infection spread.</description>

    <measure>Risk ratios of adverse obstetric in women infect with SARS-CoV-2 during early pregnancy onward compared to non-infected pregnant women</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine risk ratios of adverse obstetric outcomes in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during early pregnancy onward compared to non-infected pregnant women. The investigators will focus on timing of infection (gestational month) and extent of COVID-19 symptoms as potential predictors of risk. Deliverable: The investigators will provide critical information about the maternal and fetal implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection at specific time points in pregnancy, compared to non-exposed pregnancies, and enable evidence-based obstetric surveillance protocols.</description>

Deliverable: The investigators will provide novel findings that identify high-risk groups warranting more aggressive social avoidance measures during pregnancy.</description>

      At-home blood spot kits will be used for serology surveillance. Tests will occur weekly&#xD;
      during the first trimester and monthly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Covid-19 antibody serology and cytokine testing will be assayed using these blood spot cars.&#xD;
