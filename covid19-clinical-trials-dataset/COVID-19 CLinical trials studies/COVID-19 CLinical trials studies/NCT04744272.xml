  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common lung condition that causes long-term breathing problems. There is no cure&#xD;
      and if uncontrolled can be life threatening. Many asthma deaths are preventable if managed&#xD;
      using a personalised treatment plan explaining what to do when unwell, how to manage symptoms&#xD;
      and correct inhaler use. Those with controlled asthma are less likely to be admitted to&#xD;
      hospital and more likely to have an improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID19 has emphasised the need to redesign healthcare delivery to reduce avoidable exposure.&#xD;
      Clinical services are turning to remote care including online digital health apps. Digital&#xD;
      health offers mechanisms to promote effective asthma care, offer remote individual treatment&#xD;
      plans, monitor asthma control in 'real time' and provides information to prevent asthma&#xD;
      attacks. Regulatory health guidelines recognise that technology has the potential to improve&#xD;
      asthma care and could lead to reductions in NHS service use and improve symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the delivery of an asthma self-management app 'myAsthma' in a&#xD;
      secondary care asthma service. Patients will use the app to input and track their symptoms&#xD;
      and report their medication usage. The app provides information on environmental triggers&#xD;
      such as air quality to better prepare asthma sufferers in preventing an asthma attack. It&#xD;
      offers educational videos to improve understanding of asthma, including online training in&#xD;
      inhaler technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals are to increase adherence to and correct use of medication, help patients&#xD;
      self-manage dynamically to reduce their risk of an asthma attack and equip healthcare&#xD;
      professionals with the data to identify those people at higher risk of an attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an unblinded randomised controlled trial with two arms: standard care (control) and&#xD;
      myAsthma with standard care (intervention). Asthma control will be compared between the&#xD;
      groups. It is a single-centre study which will take place in Bradford Teaching Hospital. A&#xD;
      minimum of 60 participants will be recruited into the study and randomised on a ratio of 1:1&#xD;
      - 30 in the control arm and 30 in the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 6 months outcomes will be measured using a combination of questionnaires and Asthma&#xD;
      Control Test Scores (measure of symptom control). The main outcome of this study is to&#xD;
      explore the efficacy of this new model of service delivery, whether it can provide an&#xD;
      improvement in asthma control test scores, and will lead to a fully powered randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic highly prevalent condition, which results from inflammation and&#xD;
      hyper-responsiveness of the airways resulting in variable airway limitation and symptoms of&#xD;
      wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness. There is no cure for asthma, but the use&#xD;
      of simple inhaler treatments can keep the symptoms under control. However, if uncontrolled,&#xD;
      asthma can be life-threatening. Most deaths related to asthma are preventable if the&#xD;
      condition is managed using the right treatment plan and inhaler technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, an estimated 4.3 million adults (1 in 12) receive treatment for asthma costing the&#xD;
      NHS around Â£3 billion annually in direct and indirect care. Asthma accounts for approximately&#xD;
      60,000 hospital admissions per year. The NRAD states that a high proportion of patient&#xD;
      morbidity is directly related to poor management. The annual 2016 asthma survey reported that&#xD;
      82% of asthma suffers said their asthma was poorly controlled. Those with uncontrolled asthma&#xD;
      were almost twice as likely to be admitted to hospital. In the UK seven out of ten people&#xD;
      with asthma received care that failed to meet basic quality standards with 30-70% reported as&#xD;
      not taking their asthma medication as prescribed. Additionally, a significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients do not use their inhalers as prescribed and demonstrate poor inhaler technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the arrival of COVID-19, it has never been more important for asthma suffers to ensure&#xD;
      they are following their prescribed treatment plan. COVID-19 is a highly infectious virus&#xD;
      that primarily affects the respiratory system, meaning those with asthma are at greater risk&#xD;
      of severe complications. Maintaining consistent infection prevention practices and social&#xD;
      distancing are key to minimising the risk of contracting the virus. However, social&#xD;
      distancing and required 'lockdown' has impacted on routine clinic appointments, highlighting&#xD;
      a lack of an alternative remote self-management system to support patients during this&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews have shown that despite the heterogenous interventions, technology enabled&#xD;
      healthcare can improve process outcomes such as patient knowledge, self-management skills,&#xD;
      improvement in inhaler technique and increased use of preventer medication. However, to date&#xD;
      studies have shown an inconsistent effect on clinical outcomes such as symptoms, lung&#xD;
      function, SABA use and quality of life. The use of technology enabled healthcare in asthma&#xD;
      care has not identified significant harms or instances in which it was less effective than&#xD;
      conventional care and results were encouraging enough to suggest further analysis of digital&#xD;
      models of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to COVID-19, the NHS model of care included a once annual asthma review. This has&#xD;
      raised concerns that the full picture of asthma control may not be captured and is generally&#xD;
      limited to the period around that review which is a fraction of the time people are living&#xD;
      with asthma. Healthcare professionals aim to deliver best care and promote good asthma&#xD;
      self-management, but this can be complex and time-consuming and so often not possible in the&#xD;
      given time for primary care appointments, leading to adverse outcomes and variations in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunities to address variations in care were identified in the NRAD. These included&#xD;
      improving risk stratification to distinguish between those with asthma requiring minimal&#xD;
      support through an annual review, and those who require closer monitoring throughout the&#xD;
      year. Addressing safer prescribing to highlight those who have been prescribed excessive&#xD;
      quantities of SABA inhalers, improving systems to arrange follow up, raising the quality of&#xD;
      medical records and enabling systems to support asthma self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, Asthma UK conducted a large survey to explore both asthma patients and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals' views on mobile health (mHealth) requirements. They found that two-thirds of&#xD;
      adult asthma sufferers had a smartphone suggesting that with the increasing presence of&#xD;
      technology in homes, remote monitoring is becoming an alternative health service delivery&#xD;
      option. The reported showed that almost three-quarters of patients would value an mHealth&#xD;
      device to support asthma monitoring, and almost half would consider a system for use as part&#xD;
      of an asthma action plan, to offer advice on medication and when to seek medical attention.&#xD;
      Additionally, three-quarters of healthcare professionals stated an mHealth system which&#xD;
      monitored asthma symptoms and provide asthma action plans would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital healthcare interventions are now more important than ever. They are able to support&#xD;
      healthcare services to remotely deliver patient-centered care, facilitate timely access to&#xD;
      health advice and medications, promote self-monitoring and medication compliance, and educate&#xD;
      patients on trigger avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has shown that self-managed education, incorporating personalised asthma action&#xD;
      plans improves health outcomes for people with asthma and reduces the use of healthcare&#xD;
      resources particularly emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      can improve markers of asthma control, including reduced symptoms and has a positive effect&#xD;
      on quality of life.&#xD;
