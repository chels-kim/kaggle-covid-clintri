    <textblock>
      A study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Longidaze for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease following COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the outcomes associated with postinflammatory pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and interstitial lung disease among a cohort of adult patients after complicated&#xD;
      pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in two groups: in a group of patients who were&#xD;
      prescribed Longidaze® for treatment or prevention as part of routine clinical practice, and&#xD;
      in the group of patients who underwent dynamic observation.&#xD;
