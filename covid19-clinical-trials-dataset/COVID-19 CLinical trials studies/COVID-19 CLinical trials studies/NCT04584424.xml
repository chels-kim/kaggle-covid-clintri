      The aim of the study will be to determine the epidemiological and clinical features of&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases, immunological and virological courses, interaction with nutritional status,&#xD;
      and response to treatment for COVID-19 patients admitted to treatment centers in Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This multi-site cohort enrolls, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted&#xD;
      to treatment centers will be enrolled irrespective of their symptoms and followed up for 12&#xD;
      months. Baseline epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging data will be collected&#xD;
      from treatment records, interviews, physical measurements and biological samples. Endline&#xD;
      data involves treatment and prognostic outcomes to be measured using different biomarkers and&#xD;
      clinical parameters, The patients will be followed up in the selected treatment centers for&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. For all data collected both descriptive and multivariable analyses will&#xD;
      be performed to isolated determinants of the treatment outcome and prognosis to generate&#xD;
      relevant information for informed prevention and case management.&#xD;

      Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became pandemic after emerging in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China, in December 2019 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2). Following the swift spread of the virus,4, 710,000 confirmed cases and 315,000&#xD;
      deaths were reported worldwide as of May 17, 2020,and 317 confirmed cases and 5 deaths are&#xD;
      reported nationally. To understand the drastically negative impacts of COVID-19 on the public&#xD;
      health and key features pertinent to the disease various researches are under investigation&#xD;
      at the global level and they are contributing to delineating the characteristics of the&#xD;
      disease and its lethality. However, the potential acceptability of different risks varies&#xD;
      depending on numerous factors including the type of research and the context in which it&#xD;
      takes place. Currently, it is recognized that a 'one size fits all' approach towards the&#xD;
      design and implementation of interventions may not be appropriate. Therefore, it is found&#xD;
      apparent that global priorities, protocols and intervention assessments have to be&#xD;
      contextualized and adjusted to local needs and realities, including translation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 cases,&#xD;
      immunological and virological courses, interaction with nutritional status, and response to&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19 patients admitted to treatment centers in Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This multi-site cohort enrolls, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted&#xD;
      to treatment centers will be enrolled irrespective of their symptoms and followed up for 12&#xD;
      months. Baseline epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging data will be collected&#xD;
      from treatment records, interviews, physical measurements and biological samples. Endline&#xD;
      data involves treatment and prognostic outcomes to be measured using different biomarkers and&#xD;
      clinical parameters, The patients will be followed up in the selected treatment centers for&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. For all data collected both descriptive and multivariable analyses will&#xD;
      be performed to isolated determinants of the treatment outcome and prognosis to generate&#xD;
      relevant information for informed prevention and case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: The study will generate scientific data for a systematic understanding of&#xD;
      natural history, epidemiological characteristics, clinical features and management of&#xD;
      COVID-19 that will in turn enables country's health sector to develop strategies to prevent&#xD;
      and control the pandemic before it poses further health and socioeconomic crisis.&#xD;
