  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the intake of Omni-Biotic速 10 AAD can reduce intestinal inflammation and&#xD;
      improves dysbiosis in Covid-19 disease. We further hypothesize that Omni-Biotic速 10 AAD can&#xD;
      reduce the duration of diarrhea, stool frequency, improve stool consistency, improve other&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms of Covid-19, reduce disease duration and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to perform a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study using&#xD;
      telemedicine in patients with Covid-19 disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected disease (COVID-19) began in&#xD;
      Wuhan, Hubei province in December 2019, spread throughout China in early 2020 and developed&#xD;
      as a pandemic thereafter. Although the virus mainly causes respiratory symptoms, GI&#xD;
      (gastrointestinal) presentations have been reported in and outside of China. Patients may&#xD;
      present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Also, faecal-oral&#xD;
      transmission of the virus is currently discussed. Preliminary, unpublished data from China&#xD;
      suggest that patients with GI symptoms may suffer more frequently from severe courses of the&#xD;
      disease. Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.&#xD;
      It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall&#xD;
      percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2&#xD;
      (ACE2) for cellular entry. ACE2 is expressed in the small intestinal epithelia as well as in&#xD;
      the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly&#xD;
      higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Diarrhea is associated with prolonged symptoms&#xD;
      and viral carriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information on the characteristics of Covid-19 diarrhea is scarce. The duration of&#xD;
      diarrhea is around 4 days with 3-4 loose stools per day. Faecal calprotectin is elevated in&#xD;
      stool of patients with Covid-19 diarrhea, indicating a relation between gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms and this well-established inflammation biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, no therapy is available for Covid-19 infection in general or for Covid-19 induced&#xD;
      diarrhea. Rehydration and potassium monitoring should be performed as in all patients with&#xD;
      diarrhea. It is important to underline that antivirals and antibiotics are often used for&#xD;
      COVID-19 treatment or treatment of bacterial superinfections, involving a likely alteration&#xD;
      of the gut microbiota and causing diarrhea. It is therefore plausible that the gut microbiota&#xD;
      could be a new therapeutic target and that probiotics or synbiotics (combination of&#xD;
      probiotics with prebiotics) could have a role in the management of these patients. The&#xD;
      China's National Health Commission recommended the use of probiotics for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with severe COVID-19 in order to preserve intestinal balance and to prevent&#xD;
      secondary bacterial infections without any available clinical studies to support this and&#xD;
      probiotics apparently were used in Zhejiang during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although there is&#xD;
      no specific data on the effects of probiotics on SARS-CoV2 infections, meta-analyses show&#xD;
      that probiotics are effective in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and&#xD;
      viral gastroenteritis of other origins. Furthermore, Enterococcus faecium has been shown to&#xD;
      have antiviral effects in enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus&#xD;
      infections in piglets. We therefore aim to assess the role of synbiotics in the therapy of&#xD;
      Covid-19 infection with gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
