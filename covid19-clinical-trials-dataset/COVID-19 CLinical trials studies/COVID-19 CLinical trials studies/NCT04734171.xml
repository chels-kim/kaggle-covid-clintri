    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the association of quarantine measures for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and perceived anxiety, stigma and loneliness and to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      interventions in reducing anxiety, loneliness and perception of stigma induced by&#xD;
      self-isolation during the outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, participants will include members of the United States general&#xD;
      population who will be randomly assigned to either (a) a vignette to learn about the COVID-19&#xD;
      outbreak, (b) a vignette to learn about the COVID-19 outbreak AND a video aimed at&#xD;
      encouraging the use of a digital device (i.e. not in person contact) to meet with friends,&#xD;
      (c) a vignette to learn about the COVID-19 outbreak AND a video aimed at sensitizing&#xD;
      participants to COVID-19 related stigma, (d) Control arm. Web-based self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires will be conducted to compare interventions and control groups. The short and&#xD;
      low-cost online module will allow recruitment of a large sample of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) the video-based intervention groups will demonstrate lower rates of anxiety and&#xD;
      loneliness than vignette and control groups, (2) the video-based group that presents an&#xD;
      individual with COVID-19 will demonstrate lower rate of stigma than other groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the world is experiencing a Coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19, which originated in&#xD;
      mainland China in December 2019, spread rapidly to South Korea and Europe, Italy in&#xD;
      particular, between January and March of 2020 and is currently spreading in all continents&#xD;
      and has been recognized as a pandemic. It is of high importance to monitor how the trends in&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak are shaping the social contexts and norms across communities and families.&#xD;
      In a time in which individuals all over the world are experiencing quarantine, it is&#xD;
      important to evaluate the potential surge of the phenomena of social anxiety, stigma, and of&#xD;
      perceived fear and loneliness. Furthermore, it is critical to study interventions that aim to&#xD;
      reduce each of these. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the association of&#xD;
      quarantine measures for COVID-19 and perceived anxiety, stigma and loneliness and to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of interventions in reducing anxiety, loneliness and perception of stigma&#xD;
      induced by self-isolation during the outbreak. The hypotheses will be tested using ANOVA and&#xD;
      multinomial logistic regressions. An alpha level of 0.01 will be used to account for multiple&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
