  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis of emergency general surgical admissions during the first six months&#xD;
      of the pandemic (from March 11 to September 11, 2020) and the same period in 2019, will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The volume and disease severity of emergency general surgery admissions between the first&#xD;
      six-month period of the pandemic and the similar time period in the prepandemic period in&#xD;
      2019 will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 11 to&#xD;
      September 11, 2020, will be included. As a comparison group, similar data will be collected&#xD;
      on patients admitted to the general surgery department during the same period in 2019.&#xD;
      Patient and disease characteristics, including demographics, initial leukocyte and C-reactive&#xD;
      protein levels, diagnosis, treatment strategies, complications, duration of hospital stay,&#xD;
      30-day rehospitalization rate, and 30-day reoperation rate will be reviewed. Complications&#xD;
      will be classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. Tokyo Guidelines 2018/2013 will&#xD;
      be used to assess the severity of the acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients are divided into two groups: (1) prepandemic period and (2) pandemic&#xD;
      period, descriptive statistics will be presented as the medians and ranges, and frequencies&#xD;
      (%). Associations between variables will be evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test (for&#xD;
      continuous variables) or Pearson's chi-square and Fisher exact tests (for categorical&#xD;
      variables), where appropriate.&#xD;
