      The study is expected to treat patients with mild and severe neo-coronary pneumonia through&#xD;
      standard treatment regimens in combination with tetrandrine tablets, thereby reducing the&#xD;
      clinical progress of some patients, improving prognosis, reducing the incidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis during rehabilitation, and improving patients' quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia infected with the new coronavirus have&#xD;
      been found in wuhan, hubei province.Has now become a global epidemic of crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recent frontline anti-epidemic experience, the diagnostic and treatment specifications&#xD;
      for new coronary pneumonia have been updated several times. In the latest country,&#xD;
      &quot;Specifications for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Types of Coronary Pneumonia (Trial&#xD;
      Version 6)&quot;, the traditional Chinese medicines have again emphasized For the treatment of&#xD;
      patients, traditional Chinese medicine preparations such as Xuebijing and Qingfei Paidu&#xD;
      Decoction have been recommended, but the introduction of anti-fibrosis related drugs is still&#xD;
      lacking.Tetrandrine is a traditional Chinese medicine. Previous research has shown that it is&#xD;
      an antagonist of calmodulin, has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory effects, and can effectively&#xD;
      inhibit fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis.The study is expected to treat&#xD;
      patients with mild and severe neo-coronary pneumonia through standard treatment regimens in&#xD;
      combination with tetrandrine tablets, thereby reducing the clinical progress of some&#xD;
      patients, improving prognosis, reducing the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis during&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and improving patients' quality of life.&#xD;
