    <textblock>
      This is a platform trial to conduct a series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials using common assessments and endpoints in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
      BET is a proof-of-concept study with the intent of identifying promising treatments to enter&#xD;
      a more definitive study. The study will be conducted in up to 40 sites throughout the US. The&#xD;
      study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a common control arm and&#xD;
      determine which have relatively large effects. In order to maintain the double blind, each&#xD;
      intervention will have a matched placebo. However, the control arm will be shared between&#xD;
      interventions and may include participants receiving the matched placebo for a different&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is not to determine clear statistical significance for an intervention, but rather&#xD;
      to determine which products have clinical data suggestive of efficacy and should be moved&#xD;
      quickly into larger studies. Estimates produced from BET will provide an improved basis for&#xD;
      designing the larger trial, in terms of sample size and endpoint selection. Products with&#xD;
      little indication of efficacy will be dropped on the basis of interim evaluations. In&#xD;
      addition, some interventions may be discontinued on the basis of interim futility or efficacy&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or more interventions may be started at any time. The number of interventions enrolling&#xD;
      are programmatic decisions and will be based on the number of sites and the pace of&#xD;
      enrollment. At the time of enrollment, subjects will be randomized to receive any one of the&#xD;
      active arms they are eligible for or placebo. Approximately 200 (100 treatment and 100 shared&#xD;
      placebo) subjects will be assigned to each arm entering the platform and a given site will&#xD;
      generally have no more than 3 interventions at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BET-B stage will evaluate the combination of remdesivir with lenzilumab vs remdesivir&#xD;
      with a lenzilumab placebo. The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in adults hospitalized&#xD;
      with COVID-19 according to clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at Day 8.&#xD;

      This is a platform trial to conduct a series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials using common assessments and endpoints in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
      BET is a proof-of-concept study with the intent of identifying promising treatments to enter&#xD;
      a more definitive study. The study will be conducted in up to 40 sites throughout the US. The&#xD;
      study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a common control arm and&#xD;

&#xD;
      The goal is not to determine clear statistical significance for an intervention, but rather&#xD;
      to determine which products have clinical data suggestive of efficacy and should be moved&#xD;
      quickly into larger studies. Estimates produced from BET will provide an improved basis for&#xD;
      designing the larger trial, in terms of sample size and endpoint selection. Products with&#xD;
      little indication of efficacy will be dropped on the basis of interim evaluations. In&#xD;
      addition, some interventions may be discontinued on the basis of interim futility or efficacy&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or more interventions may be started at any time. The number of interventions enrolling&#xD;
      are programmatic decisions and will be based on the number of sites and the pace of&#xD;
      enrollment. At the time of enrollment, subjects will be randomized to receive any one of the&#xD;
      active arms they are eligible for or placebo. Approximately 200 (100 treatment and 100 shared&#xD;
      placebo) subjects will be assigned to each arm entering the platform and a given site will&#xD;
      generally have no more than 3 interventions at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BET-B stage will evaluate the combination of remdesivir with lenzilumab vs remdesivir&#xD;
      with a lenzilumab placebo. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Once subjects&#xD;
      are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 8, 15, 22, 29, and 60&#xD;
      as an outpatient. The Day 8, Day 22 and Day 60 visits do not have laboratory tests or&#xD;
      collection of samples and may be conducted by phone. All subjects will undergo a series of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and&#xD;
      plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Day 1 (prior to&#xD;
      study product administration) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 while hospitalized. OP swabs&#xD;
      (oropharyngeal swabs are preferred, but if these are not obtainable, saliva or nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      or nasal swabs may be substituted) and blood research samples plus safety laboratory tests&#xD;
      will be collected on Day 15 and 29 if the subject attends an in-person visit or is still&#xD;
      hospitalized. However, if infection control considerations or other restrictions prevent the&#xD;
      subject from returning to the clinic, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone and only&#xD;
      clinical data will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational&#xD;
      therapeutics relative to the control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 according to&#xD;
      clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at Day 8. The key secondary objectives are to 1)&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics as assessed by time&#xD;
      to recovery compared to the control arm, and 2) to evaluate the proportion of subjects alive&#xD;
      and without respiratory failure through Day 29.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Received small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including Janus kinase (JAK)&#xD;
             inhibitors (e.g., baricitinib, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, imatinib, gefitinib), in the&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Received monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#xD;

             sarilumab, sitlukimab]), or T-cells (e.g., abatacept) in the 4 weeks prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Received monoclonal antibodies targeting B-cells (e.g., rituximab, and including any&#xD;

             sargramostim) within 2 months prior to screening.&#xD;

         12. Received other immunosuppressants in the 4 weeks prior to screening and in the&#xD;
             judgement of the investigator, the risk of immunosuppression with lenzilumab is larger&#xD;
