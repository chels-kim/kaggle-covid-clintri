      REmotely Monitored, Mhealth (REMM) supported High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT to&#xD;
      improve recovery after Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      (REMM-HIIT-ICU-COVID) will evaluate the feasibility of clinical-, physiological- and&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes associated with a 90-day remotely monitored, Mhealth-supported high&#xD;
      intensity interval rehabilitation exercise training to improve the functional recovery of&#xD;
      survivors who have experienced critical illness with COVID-19 and have been discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of high intensity interval training, consisting of a 30-minute exercise session that includes 10 x 1-minute intervals of high intensity 3x/week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and functional strengthening and balance exercise in between (e.g., Tuesday, Thursday). Exercise will be supported by an activity tracker, which will allow study personnel to track patient heart rates during exercise on a daily basis, allowing them to provide individualized feedback and coaching.</description>
