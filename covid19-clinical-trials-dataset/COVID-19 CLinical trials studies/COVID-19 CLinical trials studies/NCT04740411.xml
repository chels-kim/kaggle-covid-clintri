  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating the effects of an online single-session mental health intervention (the&#xD;
      Common Elements Toolbox; COMET). To evaluate COMET, we are conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with college students attending American universities. Students will be randomized to&#xD;
      the COMET condition or to a wait-list control condition.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability to Cope with COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>2 questions related to their ability to cope with stressors over the upcoming weeks (including challenges relating to COVID-19). Participants answered these questions on a 7-point Likert Scale, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Specifically, we asked participants: a) if they will be able to handle lifestyle changes due to the coronavirus and b) if the pandemic will have an extremely negative impact on their life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We administered three items to assess secondary control, derived from the Secondary Control Scale for Children (Weisz et al., 2010). The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;Very false&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very true&quot;). Scores on each item range from 0-4, with higher scores indicating more secondary control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring positive affect and negative affect. Scores on the positive affect subscale range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Scores on the negative affect subscale range from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Utility Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate three items relating to the perceived utility of each module. Specifically, we asked participants: How helpful the module was How engaging the module was How much they will continue applying content from the module. Higher scores indicate greater perceived utility.</description>
