  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sequential randomized, multicenter, active comparator study to evaluate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      rNAPc2 (AB201), a novel, potent and highly selective tissue factor inhibitor with&#xD;
      anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties, shortens time to&#xD;
      recovery compared to heparin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

      Sequential randomized, multicenter, active comparator study to evaluate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      rNAPc2, a novel, potent and highly selective tissue factor inhibitor with anticoagulant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties, shortens time to recovery compared to&#xD;
      heparin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels. Study&#xD;
      participants and Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) members assessing the clinical endpoints&#xD;
      will be blinded to treatment assignment. The protocol comprises sequential Phase 2b and Phase&#xD;
      3 studies. Analysis of Phase 2b data could lead to study discontinuation, adjustment of&#xD;
      eligibility criteria or sample size, and will inform the rNAPc2 dose level to be studied in&#xD;
      Phase 3.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 90 years at the Screening assessment&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or other tissue/body fluid&#xD;
             samples by PCR or validated other test of ongoing infection (not an antibody test for&#xD;
             prior exposure), within seven (7) days prior to hospitalization or screening&#xD;
             assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. D-dimer level &gt; upper limit of normal at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Provided electronic or written informed consent, either personally or through a&#xD;
             legally authorized representative (LAR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must agree not to participate in a concurrent interventional study involving&#xD;
             anticoagulation or anti-platelet therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any woman who suspects she may be pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test prior&#xD;
             to randomization. Women of child-bearing potential should agree to avoid pregnancy for&#xD;

             anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sustained systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg considered to be clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Persistent eGFR &lt;20 ml/min/1.73m2&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy estimated to be &lt; 72 hours based on current clinical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Anticipated hospital discharge or transfer within 72 hours based on current clinical&#xD;
             condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known anti-phospholipid syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unable to receive heparin, e.g. history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and&#xD;
             thrombosis (HITT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in a clinical study or treatment with an investigational drug or device,&#xD;
             defined as one not approved for any indication in the US, Europe or Japan, within&#xD;
             seven (7) days of the Screening assessment or within 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational agent, whichever is longer&#xD;
