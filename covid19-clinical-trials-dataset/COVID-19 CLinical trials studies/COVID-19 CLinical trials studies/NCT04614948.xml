  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll up to 30,000 participants in order to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical&#xD;
      coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), as compared to placebo, in adult participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program is to develop a safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. Currently, there are no approved vaccines&#xD;
      for the prevention of COVID-19. Ad26.COV2.S, a COVID-19 vaccine based on a human&#xD;
      replication-incompetent Ad26 vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spike (S) protein, is being developed. The study&#xD;
      will consist of: a screening phase (up to 28 days), double-blind study period (60-week), and&#xD;
      a long-term follow-up period (1 additional year). The total study duration will be maximum 2&#xD;
      years and 3 months for the participants. Assessments like efficacy (COVID-19 like signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, etc), immunogenicity (such as humoral immune responses), and safety (such as AEs&#xD;
      monitoring) will be performed throughout the study.&#xD;
