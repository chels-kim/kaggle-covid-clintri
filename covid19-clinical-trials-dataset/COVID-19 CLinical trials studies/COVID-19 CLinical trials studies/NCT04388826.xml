      To demonstrate the efficacy of VERU-111 in the treatment of SARS-Cov-2 Infection by assessing&#xD;
      its effect on the proportion of subjects that are alive without respiratory failure at Day&#xD;
      22. Respiratory failure is defined as non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen,&#xD;
      intubation and mechanical ventilation, or ventilation with additional organ support (e.g.,&#xD;
      pressors, RRT, ECMO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-control, efficacy and safety study of&#xD;
      VERU-111 for the treatment of COVID-19. Subjects will receive either 18 mg of VERU-111 or&#xD;
      matching placebo orally or through nasogastric tube daily for to 21 days or until the subject&#xD;
      is discharged from the hospital, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be the proportion of subjects that are alive&#xD;
      without respiratory failure at Day 22. Respiratory failure is defined as non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation or high-flow oxygen, intubation and mechanical ventilation, or ventilation with&#xD;
      additional organ support (e.g., pressors, RRT, ECMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration for a subject from screening to follow up visit is planned to be 62&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the effect of VERU-111 on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) compared to the placebo&#xD;
      control will be evaluated after the last subject has completed Day 22. This will allow for&#xD;
      the decision to move to Phase 3 more quickly if the Phase 2 portion of the study shows a&#xD;
      clinically relevant difference in the proportion of subjects that are alive without&#xD;
      respiratory failure at Day 22 in the VERU-111 treated groups compared to the Placebo&#xD;
      treatment group and VERU-111 is well tolerated in the study.&#xD;
