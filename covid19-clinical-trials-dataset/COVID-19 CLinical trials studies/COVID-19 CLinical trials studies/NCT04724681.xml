  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients admitted with COVID-19 infection, it is often difficult to predict if or when&#xD;
      their clinical condition will deteriorate. However subtle changes in vital signs are usually&#xD;
      present 8 to 24 hours before a life-threatening event such as respiratory failure leading to&#xD;
      ICU admission, or unanticipated cardiac arrest. Such adverse trends in clinical observations&#xD;
      can be missed, misinterpreted or not appreciated as urgent. New continuous and wearable 24/7&#xD;
      clinical vital parameter monitoring systems offer a unique possibility to identify clinical&#xD;
      deterioration before patients condition progress beyond the point-of-no-return, where adverse&#xD;
      events are inevitable. The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of continuous&#xD;
      wireless vital signs monitoring with generation of real-time alerts through a purpose-built&#xD;
      GUI, compared to standard EWS monitoring on the cumulative duration of any severely deviating&#xD;
      vital signs&#xD;
