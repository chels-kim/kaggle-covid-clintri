  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, expanded access study of exebacase used in addition to&#xD;
      antistaphylococcal antibiotics in adult patients with persistent methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections (BSI), including right-sided endocarditis&#xD;
      (R-IE), who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with&#xD;
      left-sided endocarditis (L-IE) are excluded. Patients will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      exebacase. Patients will continue to receive antistaphylococcal antibiotics as prescribed by&#xD;
      the treating physician. Exebacase Phase 3 study sites (Study CF-301-105) may participate in&#xD;
      this Expanded Access study (Study CF-301-107).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exebacase, a direct lytic agent, is an entirely new treatment modality against S. aureus.&#xD;
      Exebacase is a recombinantly-produced, purified cell wall hydrolase enzyme that results in&#xD;
      rapid bacteriolysis, potent biofilm eradication, synergy with antibiotics, low propensity for&#xD;
      resistance, and the potential to suppress antibiotic resistance when used together with&#xD;
      antibiotics. Exebacase represents a first-in-field, first-in-class treatment with the&#xD;
      potential to improve clinical outcome when used in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics&#xD;
      to treat S. aureus BSI including IE.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive a single IV infusion of exebacase in addition to antistaphylococcal antibiotics prescribed by the treating physician. Patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment will be administered a dose of 18 mg of exebacase; patients with moderate or severe renal impairment will be administered a dose of 12 mg; patients with end-stage renal disease, including those on hemodialysis, will be administered a dose of 8 mg.</description>
