      Community pharmacy in Egypt is considered as the frontline health care system that is easily&#xD;
      and freely accessible by the patients, in this pandemic and due to the current circumstances&#xD;
      from closing most general hospitals in front of the public, and with the government applying&#xD;
      curfew long hours, community pharmacists were the only healthcare providers available for&#xD;
      most patients. Their role will not be restricted to delivering medication but expands to&#xD;
      monitoring patient conditions especially those with chronic diseases and patient counseling&#xD;
      and education clarifying any misunderstanding concerning covid1-19 medication. The present&#xD;
      study includes a questionnaire (with detailed questions including how/when/which/for how long&#xD;
      antibiotics are prescribed) that is addressed for community pharmacists who dealt with&#xD;
      covid-19 patients during the pandemic.&#xD;
