    <textblock>
      Appendectomy is the most effective treatment option for acute appendisitis, which is the most&#xD;
      commen emergent surgical pathology. However with in time period, surgical treatment borders&#xD;
      are narrowed. Especially in uncomplicated acute appendicitis cases, nonoperative management&#xD;
      (NOM) with antibiotherapies becomes primary treatment option. The COVID-19 pandemic, which is&#xD;
      caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and we encountered in the current process, has&#xD;
      led to the re-questioning of surgical elective and emergency cases. Serious complications and&#xD;
      increased mortality rates of the 2019-nCoV creates a novel problems of patient selection for&#xD;
      emergent surgery and health care workers faced with potential health problems. As the same as&#xD;
      the other surgical procedures, in the uncomplicated acute appendisitis cases NOM become more&#xD;
      mandantory. NOM of uncomplicated acute appendisitis doen't increase perforation risk and&#xD;
      general practice for decreasing surgical complications in the COVID-19 pandemic period.&#xD;
      Additionally complicated acute appendicitis accounts for 20 to 30% of the patients undergoing&#xD;
      appendectomy and lead to increased risk of postoperative complications, delayed recovery and&#xD;
      longer hospital stay. Therefore, early diagnosis of complicated acute appendicitis is&#xD;
      important; however, the most appropriate and inexpensive diagnostic method to make this&#xD;
      diagnosis has not been established yet. Although the use of imaging methods is widespread,&#xD;
      these methods are not accessible in many rural hospitals due to the high costs and&#xD;
      unavailability of specialists. Thus, the need for an inexpensive and effective diagnostic&#xD;
      technique allowing to make a differential diagnosis has not been met yet. For this purpose,&#xD;
      several inexpensive and easily accessible blood parameter tests have been proposed; including&#xD;
      the white blood cell count, immature granulocyte (IG) percentage, C-reactive protein levels&#xD;
      or the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in the IG count shows that the bone marrow is active. This parameter has been&#xD;
      used as a prognostic factor in many infectious and non infectious diseases including sepsis,&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis, and acute myocardial infarction. The Immature granulocyte (IG) fraction&#xD;
      includes promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes but not band neutrophils or&#xD;
      myeloblasts. The IG count and percentage has become an easy-to-use method, especially with&#xD;
      the introduction of technological advances, as it can be easily determined using the results&#xD;
      of a routine complete blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is aimed to efficacy of IG count and percentage which are calculated automatically in CBC&#xD;
      samples, to differatiate the complicated and uncomplicated acute appendicitis cases with a&#xD;
      cheap, easily applicable and cost effective test, especially in rural areas without enough&#xD;
      diagnostic tests in COVID-19 pandemy.&#xD;

      The data of 146 patients elder than 18 years, who admitted to the Emergency Department and&#xD;
      General Surgery outpatient clinic with the complaint of abdominal pain diagnosed with acute&#xD;
      appendicitis and who were operated by the same surgical team between June 2018 and June 2019&#xD;
      were evaluated retrospectively after the approval of the local ethics committee. Patients'&#xD;
      data were obtained by reviewing the patient follow charts, laboratory findings in the the&#xD;
      electronic database of the hospital and epicrisis forms. Totally 76 patients excluded from&#xD;
      the study; 22 patients were excluded because of the pathological diagnosis did not confirm&#xD;
      acute appendicitis (negative appendectomies and appendiceal mucinous cystadenomas), 54&#xD;
      patients who were operated by the other surgical team were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were assigned to the complicated acute appendicitis group (Group C) based on the&#xD;
      preoperative imaging findings (periappendiceal abscess formation or significant&#xD;
      periappendiceal fat tissue contamination in ultrasonography and computed tomography),&#xD;
      intraoperative exploration findings (presence of gangrenous appendicitis, perforation or&#xD;
      abscess formation), and pathological examination findings (acute phlegmonous appendicitis,&#xD;
      acute gangrenous appendicitis or acute perforated appendicitis). The patients were assigned&#xD;
      to the uncomplicated acute appendicitis group (Group UC) based on the increased diameter and&#xD;
      wall thickness of the appendix and detection of minimal contamination in the surrounding fat&#xD;
      tissue in the imaging tests; the presence of edema and the absence of gangrene, perforation&#xD;
      or abscess in the the exploratory surgery of appendix, and confirmation of the diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute appendicitis by the pathological examination findings [17-20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WBC, IG count and IG percentage automatically calculated in the complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC) parameters. WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and IG% were measured using&#xD;
      an automated hematological analyzer (XN 3000; Sysmex Corp., Kobe, Japan) from blood samples&#xD;
      obtained at the initial admission to the emergency department . Neutrophyl and Lymphocyte&#xD;
      counts were obtained from automatically from the CBC parameters and NLR was calculated&#xD;
      manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data (age, sex) of the patients, the white blood cell count (WBC), the&#xD;
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and the IG count and percentage were evaluated&#xD;
      retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed with the IBM Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 software. The student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were&#xD;
      used for analyzing the quantitive values based on normality of the distrubution calculated&#xD;
      with Shapiro Wilk Test. The chi-square test or Fischer's exact test was used for analyzing&#xD;
      the categorical data. ROC analysis was used to determeine spesivity and sensitivity of the&#xD;
      parameters. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the preoperative&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of the parameters. The quantitive data were given mean Â± standard&#xD;
      deviation (minimum - maximum values) or median (minimum - maximum values). The qualitative&#xD;
      values were given number of cases (n) and percentage (%). A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
