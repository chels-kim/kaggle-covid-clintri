  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit sexual and gender minority couples to complete 56 days of daily surveys in&#xD;
      order to evaluate (1) the impact of COVID-19 stress and sexual and gender minority stress on&#xD;
      heavy episodic drinking and intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, and (2) a brief,&#xD;
      mobile-phone delivered text messaging intervention to mitigate the effects of these&#xD;
      stressors. This project has high potential to inform how pandemic stress contributes to&#xD;
      etiological models of alcohol-related IPV perpetration in sexual and gender minority couples&#xD;
      and inform a culturally-sensitive, low burden, and easy to disseminate intervention to&#xD;
      mitigate these effects critical during a pandemic when access to care is limited.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be enrolled into a measurement burst daily diary design comprised of four 14-day bursts of daily surveys with three 14-day intervals that do not include daily surveys. There are three intervention conditions: (A) no intervention; (B) attention-control text messaging; or (C) CBT text messaging intervention. Between bursts 1 and 2 (Interval 1), all participants will be assigned to condition A (no intervention) such that all will complete the first two bursts (28 days) before receiving an intervention. Between bursts 2 and 3 (Interval 2) and bursts 3 and 4 (Interval 3), couples will be randomized to one of the following eight patterns of conditions: AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, or CB. There is no &quot;CC&quot; condition because the CBT intervention is not intended to be given in multiple two-week intervals.</intervention_model_description>

They will receive hourly reminders for four hours or until the message is read. Participants receive the same messages in the same order, with content equally distributed across the four content areas (i.e., psychoeducation regarding effects of stress, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, alcohol reduction).</description>

    <description>Over a 14 day period, participants will receive two text messages per day (one at 8 a.m. and one at 4 p.m.). They will receive hourly reminders for four hours or until the message is read. Participants receive the same messages in the same order. All texts will be supportive messages which express empathy and unconditional positive regard and provide support for dealing with stressors. These messages will be nondirective and will not include any CBT skill suggestions.</description>
