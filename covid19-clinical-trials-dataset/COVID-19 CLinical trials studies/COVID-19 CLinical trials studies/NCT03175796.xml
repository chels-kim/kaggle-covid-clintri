  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Infant Mental Health&#xD;
      Home Visiting (IMH-HV) model on maternal and child outcomes according to legislative&#xD;
      standards via a randomized controlled trial. The research team will recruit caregivers and&#xD;
      their children (0-24 months) or pregnant women (n=72) from locations across Washtenaw County&#xD;
      to participate in the IMH-HV RCT. Half of the women will be randomly assigned to a treatment&#xD;
      as usual (TAU) control group (with access to all available community resources), and half of&#xD;
      the women will be randomly assigned to the treatment group (i.e., IMH-HV). Women assigned to&#xD;
      the control group will not receive IMH-HV treatment through the study team, but will not be&#xD;
      prohibited from seeking or accessing IMH-HV treatment or any other services through community&#xD;
      resources. Women assigned to the treatment group will receive IMH-HV treatment for 12 months&#xD;
      through the study team with rigorous monitoring of fidelity to the IMH-HV model. All study&#xD;
      participants will undergo assessments across the 24-month period (12 months of which are the&#xD;
      treatment trial) (i.e., baseline (randomization will occur after baseline), mid-points (3, 6&#xD;
      and 9 months) and follow-ups (12, 18 and 24 months) after randomization). Additionally, all&#xD;
      study participants will have the opportunity to participate in assessments regarding their&#xD;
      experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of the Infant Mental Health Home-Visiting&#xD;
      (IMH-HV) model on parental and child outcomes according to legislative standards and&#xD;
      consistent with the State of Michigan's benchmarks. If this study confirms the efficacy of&#xD;
      the IMH-HV model, this will support the sustainability of IMH-HV in the state of Michigan as&#xD;
      evidence from a randomized controlled trial is necessary in order to access certain state and&#xD;
      federal dollars. Access to evidence-based and sustainable parenting support can ultimately&#xD;
      improve outcomes for this vulnerable population. Specifically this study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of IMH-HV treatment&#xD;
           utilizing rigorous outcomes monitoring and evaluation methodology to establish that the&#xD;
           families served achieve the intended positive benefit. Eligible caregivers and children&#xD;
           or pregnant women will be assigned to the control group or the treatment group and both&#xD;
           groups will receive research assessments at regular intervals measuring key impacts of&#xD;
           the IMH-HV model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine IMH-HV efficacy via analysis of treatment impact on key caregiver, child, and&#xD;
           family indicators. The hypothesis is that there will be positive impacts of IMH-HV, with&#xD;
           caregiver, child, and family-level improvements from baseline to post assessment on key&#xD;
           indicators, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Improved child outcomes as reflected in strengthened child physical and behavioral&#xD;
                health, development and school readiness, and reduced risk for child maltreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Improved parental outcomes including improved parent mental health, decreased child&#xD;
                abuse potential, and enhanced positive parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Improved family environment including decrease in crime and family violence,&#xD;
                enhance linkage to referrals and improve family economics and self-sufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify factors associated with family improvement, including dosage and fidelity of&#xD;
           treatment. It is the hypothesis that a dose-response association between the number of&#xD;
           home visiting sessions and treatment impact, and a positive association between fidelity&#xD;
           of treatment delivered and positive child and family outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>IMH-HV is a relationship-focused mental health intervention that aims to improve caregiver and child outcomes, including: improved caregiver mental health; enhanced positive parenting; decreased risk for physical/emotional neglect and/or abuse; and reduced risk for negative child outcomes including impaired development, cognitive delay and behavioral problems. In addition, IMH-HV services aim to reduce the probability of intergenerational transmission of the effects of unresolved loss and trauma in parents.&#xD;
The IMH-HV Model uses a range of strategies for intervention, such as:&#xD;
attending to the health and basic material needs of the infant/toddler, parent(s), and family members;&#xD;
providing developmental guidance for positive parenting behavior;&#xD;
providing counseling/emotional support for the parents;&#xD;
developing parents' life coping skills and social support; and&#xD;
providing infant/parent psychotherapy.</intervention_model_description>
