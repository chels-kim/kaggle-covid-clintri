      bacterial medium with either 1 billion (Group 1A), 3 billion (Group 2A) or 10 billion (Group&#xD;
      3A) colony-forming-units of live Bifidobacterium longum, which has been engineered to deliver&#xD;

      Protocol bacTRL-Spike-1 will be the first-in-human study of bacTRL-Spike, and the&#xD;
      first-in-human use of orally delivered bacTRL. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of orally delivered bacTRL-Spike vaccine in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total anticipated enrollment is n=24. The distribution of the sample size will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (n=3; Sentinel +2): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 1 billion colony&#xD;
           forming units (cfu) of Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (n=3; Sentinel +2): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 3 billion cfu of&#xD;
           B. longum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (n=3; Sentinel +2): Single dose of bacTRL-Spike, equivalent to 10 billion cfu of&#xD;
           B. longum;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 (n=3): Single Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)-defined dose of&#xD;
           bacTRL-Spike among subjects 56 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5 (n=12): DSMB-defined prime and boost doses of bacTRL-Spike delivered with a&#xD;
           28-day intervening interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned trial duration is 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will remain in the trial for 12-13 months, including a screening phase of up&#xD;
      to 28 days, intervention phase of 1 day and follow-up phase of 12 months.&#xD;
