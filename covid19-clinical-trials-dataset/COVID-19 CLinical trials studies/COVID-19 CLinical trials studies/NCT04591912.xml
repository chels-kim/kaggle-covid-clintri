    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of a program (called mind. body. voice. or &quot;mbv&quot;) that&#xD;
      was collaboratively designed by youth, educators, and researchers, informed by the Body&#xD;
      Project (Becker et al., 2013; Stice et al., 2019), Youth Participatory Action Research, an&#xD;
      extended co-design process, and previous iterations of the mbv program. The study evaluates&#xD;
      the impact of the mbv program on key aspects of mental health and well-being; specifically,&#xD;
      body image and disordered eating symptoms, identity and agency, social and self-constructs,&#xD;
      physical health and mood at three time points over the course of the 10-week program, which&#xD;
      will be offered remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students will be recruited&#xD;
      from high schools and will be randomized to receive the mbv program or an assessment-only&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric condition and are the&#xD;
      second leading cause of mental health disability among young women. Given that eating&#xD;
      disorders have their peak onset during adolescence (ages 16-19), prevention efforts among&#xD;
      adolescent women are critical in order to avert the onset of these chronic and disabling&#xD;
      disorders. The mbv program targets body image and appearance related pressures, awareness of&#xD;
      body sensations, and agency and community building skills. The program consists of 10 weekly&#xD;
      sessions and is delivered by peer facilitators. This study will implement and evaluate the&#xD;
      mbv program at the high school level in order to examine the extent to which the program&#xD;
      influences young women's mental health and well-being, particularly related to eating&#xD;
      disorder risk factors and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, the study seeks to address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the impact of the mbv program on key aspects of mental health and well-being;&#xD;
           specifically, body image and disordered eating symptoms, identity and agency, social and&#xD;
           self- constructs, physical health and mood among participating high school women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore young women's experiences of participating in the program, including&#xD;
           strengths and limitations and perspectives on specific activities.&#xD;
