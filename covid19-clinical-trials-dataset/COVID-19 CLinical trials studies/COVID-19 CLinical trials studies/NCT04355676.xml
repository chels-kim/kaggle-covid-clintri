&#xD;
          2. Clinical signs indicative of lower respiratory infection with COVID-19, with at least&#xD;
             one of the following: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/minute (min), heart rate ≥&#xD;
             125/min, Oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;93% on room air or requires &gt; 2L/minute oxygen by&#xD;

                  pressure ventilation, or clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure in setting of&#xD;
                  resource limitations)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Septic shock (defined by SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg, or Diastolic BP &lt; 60 mm Hg)&#xD;

          -  Concurrent anti-viral and/or anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., biologics,&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine) are not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate hematologic parameters as indicated by the following labs:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with severe neutropenia (ANC &lt;1,000 x 10^9/liter [L]) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Thrombocytopenia (e.g., platelets &lt;100,000 per microliter of blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;20 milliliter&#xD;
             per minute (mL/min) using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault.&#xD;
&#xD;
