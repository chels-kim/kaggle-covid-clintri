      Few trials have reported the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. However, these&#xD;
      trials were mostly focused on post-vaccination adverse events and short-term antibody&#xD;
      detection with none monitoring the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in blood at long-term&#xD;
      follow-up after the vaccination. This study aims to evaluate the immune response in&#xD;
      post-vaccinated individuals across a follow-up period of one year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019 and since then has spread globally claiming&#xD;
      over 550, 000 deaths, &gt;12 million infections and an economic toll in the trillions of dollars&#xD;
      to date. The urgent need for a global vaccination program to control this pandemic has&#xD;
      prompted the development of several vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary reports from few trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vaccines have&#xD;
      been published (2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no trials have yet reported the long-term post-vaccination immune response that&#xD;
      would potentially determine the necessity and timing for booster doses of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is designed to assess the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and G at&#xD;
      several time points after the first and the second dose of the vaccine.&#xD;
