    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/IIa trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunological profile of&#xD;
      INO-4800 administered by intradermal (ID) injection followed by electroporation (EP) using&#xD;
      the CELLECTRA® 2000 device in healthy adults aged 19 to 64 years in Republic of Korea. INO-&#xD;
      4800 contains the plasmid pGX9501, which encodes for the full length of the Spike&#xD;
      glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity of INO-4800 administered by ID injection followed by&#xD;
      EP in healthy adults in the Part A and Part B. Enrollment into Part A, and Part B will&#xD;
      proceed sequentially.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      [Part A] Part A is open-label, dose-ranging study, enrolling total of 40 subjects. Part A is&#xD;
      divided into two arm, low dose (Group 1) and high dose (Group 2). The subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone to report adverse events or other reactions the day following the&#xD;
      first vaccination. Once these first five subjects in Group 1 complete the Week 1 visit, all&#xD;
      available clinical laboratory and adverse event data will be reviewed by the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB). Further enrollment into Group 1 will be paused during this DSMB&#xD;
      review. If DSMB determines there are no safety findings judged to be of clinical concern and&#xD;
      no dose limiting toxicities nor any stopping events observed, enrollment will be opened for&#xD;
      the remaining subjects in Group 1. Once Group 1 enrollment is completed [i.e., 20 total&#xD;
      subjects enrolled], Group 2 will open to enrollment. Daily safety assessment of all enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will be supported by the Study Medical Monitor on an ongoing basis while the first&#xD;
      five subjects are being enrolled, if needed. The subjects will be contacted by telephone to&#xD;
      report adverse events or other reactions the day following the first vaccination. Once the&#xD;
      first five subjects Group 2 complete the Week 1 visit, all available clinical laboratory and&#xD;
      adverse event data from these first five subjects, along with the safety data from subjects&#xD;
      in Group 1, will be reviewed by the DSMB. However, enrollment may continue while this DSMB&#xD;
      review is conducted, without any pause to enrollment of the remaining subjects in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all subjects in Part A Group 1 and Group 2 complete the Week 8 visit, all available&#xD;
      clinical laboratory, adverse event, immunogenicity data from all subjects will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the DSMB. The DSMB will additionally review serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events&#xD;
      of special interest (AESIs) date throughout the study. With DSMB's recommendation, the&#xD;
      optimal dose for Part B will be selected by the Sponsor based on the following criteria which&#xD;
      may be adjusted over the course of the study. Percentage immunogenic seroconversionRelative&#xD;
      immunogenicity between INO-4800 Study Arms (Low dose vs. High dose)Safety profile of each&#xD;
      INO-4800 Study Arms (Low dose vs. High dose). All subjects will be followed for 48 weeks&#xD;
      following the 2nd vaccination. Week 52 will be the End of Study (EOS) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Part B] Part B is divided into two arm, IP Arm (Group 3) and Placebo Arm (Group 4). Part B&#xD;
      will be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, enrolling 60 subjects in IP arm,&#xD;
      and 20 subjects in Placebo arm in 19-50 age group, and 30 subjects in IP arm, and 10 subjects&#xD;
      in Placebo arm in 51-64 age group, for total of 90 subjects in IP arm, and 30 subjects in&#xD;
      Placebo arm. At dosing visit, subjects will be randomized to either Group 3 or Group 4. The&#xD;
      subjects will be contacted by telephone to report adverse events or other reactions the day&#xD;
      following the first vaccination. DSMB review of safety findings will be performed according&#xD;
      to the DSMB charter. All subjects will be followed for 48 weeks following the 2nd&#xD;
      vaccination. Week 52 will be the End of Study (EOS) visit.Should the criteria for any dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity or stopping rule be met, at any time, further enrollment and administration&#xD;
      of INO-4800 will be paused for further evaluation. The Sponsor will consult the DSMB, if&#xD;
      needed, to determine whether to enroll and/or dose the remainder of the subjects. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for 48 weeks following the 2nd vaccination. Week 52 will be the End&#xD;
      of Study (EOS) visit.&#xD;
