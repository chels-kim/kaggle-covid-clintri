    <textblock>
      This is an First In Human (FIH), observer-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of KBP-COVID-19 plus CPG adjuvant&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy CoV-2seronegative adult subjects in 2 age groups, Part A (18-49 years) and&#xD;
      Part B (50-70 years).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened up to 14 days (Day -14 to Day -1) before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 90 eligible healthy seronegative adults ages 18-49 years (inclusive) will be&#xD;
      enrolled for Part A and 90 eligible healthy seronegative adults ages 50-70 years will be&#xD;
      enrolled for Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel dosing (three subjects in each group) will be utilized in this FIH study. Sentinel&#xD;
      cohorts will be used for the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (18-49 years) low dose Part B (50-70 years) low dose Part A (18-49 years) high dose&#xD;
      Part B (50-70 years) high dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iSRC will review the safety data for the sentinel subjects through Day 8 prior to&#xD;
      enrollment of the remaining cohort subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all subjects in Part A (18-49 years) low dose have received the first vaccination and&#xD;
      have all safety data through Day 8, the iSRC will convene and review the safety data to&#xD;
      ensure that there are no safety concerns and that none of the Study Halting Rules have been&#xD;
      met before recommending that the study enroll Part A high dose. The same strategy will be&#xD;
      used for Part B (50-70 years) when going from low to high dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When 50 percent of the subjects for Part A in each dose cohort have been enrolled and have&#xD;
      data available through Day 29, the iSRC will convene and review all the data through Day 29&#xD;
      and any available data through Day 43 to ensure that there are no safety concerns and that&#xD;
      none of the Study Halting Rules have been met before recommending that the study enroll the&#xD;
      Part B (50-70 years) corresponding dose in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive study vaccine or placebo by&#xD;
      IM injection on Days 1 and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will be conducted at the clinical sites on an outpatient basis. Subjects&#xD;
      will participate in the study for approximately 1 year from the first dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. History of an acute or chronic medical condition including dementia that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with&#xD;
