  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the levels of trauma and mental symptoms (i.e.,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety) among health workers and public service providers 3 months after (T2)&#xD;
      the strict social distancing government initiated non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs)&#xD;
      related to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1), in a period of lifted distancing protocols. The study&#xD;
      also aims to investigate predictors of trauma-symptoms, by analyzing how predictors measured&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with change in PTSD symptoms from T1 to T2.&#xD;

      Hypotheses/Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There will be a significant decrease in PTSD-symptoms, anxiety and depression from T1 to&#xD;
      T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Examine the differences in levels of trauma, anxiety, depression and quality of&#xD;
      life among different health workers, public service providers, demographic subgroups, and&#xD;
      between those working directly vs indirectly with COVID-19 patients at T2. Examine the&#xD;
      differences in change of trauma, anxiety and depression among different health workers,&#xD;
      public service providers, demographic subgroups, and between those working directly vs&#xD;
      indirectly with COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Higher level at T1 and less reduction from T1 to T2 in metacognition, strategies,&#xD;
      burnout, worry about job and economy, interpersonal problems at baseline will be associated&#xD;
      with less reduction in PTSD-symptom from T1 to T2, above and beyond direct vs. indirect&#xD;
      exposure to trauma, demographic variables (age and gender, living with a partner, living with&#xD;
      children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of 'The Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence Project',&#xD;
      involving multiple studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size at T1 was 1778 participants. The sample size at T2 is not yet&#xD;
      clarified, but we expect 50% drop out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size rationale The mentioned 'Norwegian COVID-19 and Mental Health and Adherence&#xD;
      Project' involves multiple studies, where some involve a Complex Systems (Network analysis&#xD;
      approach). These multivariate analyses require large samples and power analysis was conducted&#xD;
      accordingly. Following power analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer (2017), it is recommended&#xD;
      that the number of participants be at the very least three times larger than the number of&#xD;
      estimated parameters. However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975) for&#xD;
      multivariate research, recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of&#xD;
      estimated parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will start at June 22th and continue until as many as possible of 1778&#xD;
      respondents at T1 have submitted the questionnaire. The data-collection at T2 will be stopped&#xD;
      after three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given Acceptable Cronbach's alpha (above 0.7) two items was combined to represent worry about&#xD;
      work and economy. On the CAS1 four items were combined into the subscale &quot;positive&#xD;
      metacognition&quot;, four items were combined into the subscale &quot;negative metacognition&quot;, and 8&#xD;
      items were combined into the subscale strategies (Nordahl &amp; Wells, 2019). Interpersonal&#xD;
      problems consisted of 17 items selected from the IIP-64. Burnout was measured with a single&#xD;
      item. Worry about job and economy were measured with two time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical models:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics with frequency tables including N, mean and SDs or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range depending on the data will be presented. A cut-off of 31 on the PCL-5&#xD;
      will be used together with the DSM-5 diagnostic guidelines applied to the PCL-5 to categorize&#xD;
      participants as fulfilling the PTSD symptom criteria or not. Participants indicating scores&#xD;
      of 2 or above on at least one of five re-experiencing symptoms, one of two avoidance&#xD;
      symptoms, two of seven symptoms of negative alterations in cognition and mood and two of six&#xD;
      arousal symptoms were classified as fulfilling the PTSD symptom criteria. Subclinical PTSD&#xD;
      will be assessed by specifying how large part of the sample which fulfill parts of the&#xD;
      PTSD-criterias, more specifically have at least one symptom above threshold (2 or above) in&#xD;
      each symptom-group. The results will be benchmarked against national and international&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PHQ-9, scores above 10 are considered as cut-off indicating that the patient is within&#xD;
      the depressive area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GAD-7 a cut-off of 8 and above will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired sample t-test or paired samples Wilcoxon Test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      PTSD-symptoms at T2, depending on the nature of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on level of skewness, will be conducted to&#xD;
      exploratory investigate differences between the different types of health-workers (e.g.&#xD;
      medical doctor and clinical psychologists) and public service providers (e.g., politicians,&#xD;
      social security), working directly vs indirectly. If there is significant differences between&#xD;
      the groups the investigators will either use a post hoc test, Tukey (HSD) or Dunn-Bonferroni,&#xD;
      depending on wether a parametric or non-parametric test has been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated surveys like the present one typically have a lot of drop out and missing data.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will use mixed models instead of paired t-tests, repeated measures ANOVAs, and&#xD;
      ordinary linear regression to analyze the majority of the data. Mixed models use maximum&#xD;
      likelihood estimation, which is the state of the art approach to handle missing data (Schafer&#xD;
      &amp; Graham, 2002). Especially if data are missing at random, which is likely in our survey,&#xD;
      mixed models give more unbiased results than the other analytic methods (O'Connel et al.,&#xD;
      2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary analyses, and for each of the dependent variables (PCL-5, GAD-7 and PHQ-9),&#xD;
      the combination of random effects and covariance structure of residuals that gives the best&#xD;
      fit for the &quot;empty&quot; model (the model without fixed predictors except the intercept) will be&#xD;
      chosen. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) will used to compare the fit of different&#xD;
      models. Models that give a reduction in AIC greater than 2 will be considered better (Burnham&#xD;
      &amp; Anderson, 2004). The program SPSS 25.0 will be used (IBM Corp, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, H1 about decrease in PCL-5, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 will be tested by using anxiety or&#xD;
      depression as dependent variable in a model using time (T1 period = 0, T2 period = 1) as a&#xD;
      predictor. Second, demographic group variables will be added as predictors. Third, the&#xD;
      initial (T1) levels of metacognition, strategies, burnout, worry about job and economy,&#xD;
      interpersonal problems will be added, together with the interactions of these constant&#xD;
      covariates with time. These interactions represent tests of H2 about the covariates&#xD;
      predicting change in PTSD-symptoms. Finally, the T2 levels of metacognition, strategies,&#xD;
      burnout, worry about job and economy, interpersonal problems as constant covariates will be&#xD;
      added, together with the interactions of these constant covariates with time. These&#xD;
      interactions represent tests of H2 about the change in the covariates from T1 to T2&#xD;
      predicting change in PTSD-symptoms from T1 to T2s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transformations Depending on degree of skewness compared to theoretical possibilities and&#xD;
      interpretations, variables will be assessed in their original and validated format as is&#xD;
      recommended practice, as long as this is possible. As this study examines psychopathology&#xD;
      levels amongst a general population (and not a clinical population), we do expect a skewed&#xD;
      data PTSD-symptoms on depressive and anxiety levels with most individuals reporting low&#xD;
      levels of PTSD -symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will attempt to assess these variables in their original and validated format as is&#xD;
      recommended practice, as long as this is possible. However, if this is not possible to the&#xD;
      statistical assumptions behind the analyses, transformation may be needed to apply&#xD;
      interval-based methods. Alternatively a non-parametric test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the large sample size in this study, we pre-define our significance level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      p &lt; 0.01 to determine significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All health care or public service provides above 18 are included in this study. Vulnerable&#xD;
      health-care or public service providers - in this sample defined as doctors, nurses,&#xD;
      psychologists, and any other health-care workers, as well as politicians and social workers.&#xD;
      The participants reported if they worked directly or indirectly with COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions addressed in the future paper which is not pre-specified will be defined as&#xD;
      exploratory.&#xD;
