  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent COVID 19 pandemic has overwhelmed health services all around the world, and humanity&#xD;
      has yet to find a cure or a vaccine for the treatment of patients, mainly the severe ones,&#xD;
      who pose a therapeutic challenge to healthcare professionals given the paucity of information&#xD;
      we have regarding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, reports mainly from China from patients treated with mesenchymal stem cells have&#xD;
      shown promise in accelerating recovery, even in the critically ill and the therapy has&#xD;
      sustained an increase in research because of it's powerful immunomodulatory effects, making&#xD;
      it and interesting alternative in patients with lung and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These effects could help treat a lot of patients and improve their outcomes, reason why phase&#xD;
      I/II studies are needed to show their safety and experimental efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2, virus culprit of the COVID 19 that emerged in China, has become now a worldwide&#xD;
      problem, with more than three million cases al around the world as reported by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization. This situation has put health systems under extreme pressure, being&#xD;
      overwhelmed be the amount of patients requiring attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 5% of patients will require ICU internation, due to severe lung inflammation giving&#xD;
      rise to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a cytokine storm that ultimately&#xD;
      affects other organs. In this group, mortality can be as high as 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have shown great immunomodulatory effects, and are used in other&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions as autoimmune diseases, being safe and preliminary effective in&#xD;
      improving patients health status. They exert their effect via paracrine and autocrine&#xD;
      pathways and have been shown to reduce IL-1, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor alpha and increase&#xD;
      IL-10 in COVID 19 patients. One of the greater advantages of the MSC is that they express no&#xD;
      Major Histocompatibility Complex, reducing the risk of host immune reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given their immunomodulatory effects, research in this topic showing their safety and&#xD;
      experimental efficacy are needed, as therapies for severe patients are lacking. Patients,&#xD;
      researchers and data analysts will be blinded, and ARDS patients will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      in standard therapy plus MSC arm or standard therapy alone to answer these questions.&#xD;
