  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of chloroquine (an antimalarial drug) with a weak&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effect, is prescribed by some teams alone or in combination with&#xD;
      azithromycin. No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its efficacy, particularly in&#xD;
      primary care in the early stages of the disease. However, currently available data suggest&#xD;
      better efficacy if treatment is given early in the disease, before symptoms worsen. To date,&#xD;
      the majority of COVID-19 patients treated in outpatient care, particularly in general&#xD;
      practice, represent the majority of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to evaluate, in primary care, the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      combined with azithromycin in Covid-19 patients in order to be able to implement this&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy as soon as the first symptoms appear. We realize a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, open superiority trial, in 2 parallel groups (ratio 1:1).The main objective is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients in&#xD;
      primary care, in add-on to standard of care, on unfavorable outcome defined by the onset of&#xD;
      at least one of the following between D0 and D14: hospitalization, death or percutaneous O²&#xD;
      saturation ≤ 92% in ambient air.&#xD;

      Randomized, controlled, open superiority trial, in 2 parallel groups (ratio 1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible consecutive patient will be offered to take part in the trial during a visit to&#xD;
      thier GP for COVID symptoms. After verification of eligibility criteria and written informed&#xD;
      consent, a nasopharyngeal swab, an ECG and a blood sampled (kalaemia, magnesemia and&#xD;
      calcemia) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive result and still fulfilling eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized on day2 (D2) through a web-based allocation system, following a computer generated&#xD;
      allocation list, stratified on center and existence of any comorbidity, to experimental or&#xD;
      control group. Patients without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR will not continue&#xD;
      the trial. Both groups patients will have a paper-based diary to record their daily symptoms&#xD;
      and drug intake. A clinical follow-up will be done by the GP at D5, D8, D14 and D28.The main&#xD;
      analysis population will be in intention to treat. An intermediate efficacy analysis is&#xD;
      planned when 50% of patients have reached D14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred consecutive patients (from pre-identified centers) will be included in an&#xD;
      ancillary virological study to assess evolution of viral load at D8 and D14. For these&#xD;
      patients all nasopharyngeal swab will be sent to a centralised lab at Pitié-Salpêtrière&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
