      It is known that vitamin D has been found to decrease incidence of viral respiratory&#xD;
      infections, as well as have effects on multiple cytokines involved in immunomodulation and&#xD;
      the bradykinin/renin-angiotensin system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, data was released showing a correlation between baseline vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      status and increased risk of contracting COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate analysis shows that many of the deleterious effects of COVID-19 may be due to the&#xD;
      bradykinin/RAS system, and that vitamin D is one plausible treatment option to modulate these&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies are currently ongoing to determine if vitamin D supplementation of those hospitalized&#xD;
      with COVID-19 has a beneficial effect on patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare resources have been strained during the pandemic in areas of heavy caseload. It is&#xD;
      possible that those with concurrent vitamin D deficiency and COVID positivity have an&#xD;
      increased need for escalation of care. A small study has been conducted in this area, but was&#xD;
      limited by small number of subjects.&#xD;

      Abstract: It is known that vitamin D has been found to decrease incidence of viral&#xD;
      respiratory infections, as well as have effects on multiple cytokines involved in&#xD;
      immunomodulation and the bradykinin/renin-angiotensin system. Recently, data was released&#xD;
      showing a correlation between baseline vitamin D deficiency status and increased risk of&#xD;
      contracting COVID-19. Separate analysis shows that many of the deleterious effects of&#xD;
      COVID-19 may be due to the bradykinin/RAS system, and that vitamin D is one plausible&#xD;
      treatment option to modulate these effects. Studies are currently ongoing to determine if&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation of those hospitalized with COVID-19 has a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if those hospitalized with COVID-19 with baseline vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency, have worse outcomes during their stay than those who are not vitamin D deficient&#xD;
      at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a retrospective cohort study at an urban academic&#xD;
      medical center which included patients with a 25-hydroxycholecalciferol level measured within&#xD;
      one year before being tested for COVID-19 and hospitalized from March 9th to September 7th,&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures: Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the last measurement of&#xD;
      25-hydroxycholecalciferol less than 20 ng/mL before COVID testing (within one year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes investigated include length of stay, need&#xD;
      for supplemental oxygen, ICU admission, need for invasive life support (mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis), and discharge status (discharged alive vs. death).&#xD;
