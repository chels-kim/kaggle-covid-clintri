  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To confront the COVID-19 pandemic hospitals need to maximize bed availability and minimize&#xD;
      the duration of patients' stay as much as possible. Given the constraints, physicians are&#xD;
      neither able to investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 nor able to optimize extended&#xD;
      treatments beyond the hospital. Physicians also do not have time to keep patients mobile and&#xD;
      lucid during their hospital stays, resulting in longer recovery periods and further&#xD;
      complications for patients. The investigators propose the development of a tele-monitoring&#xD;
      solution for the long-term monitoring of COVID-19 survivors. Such a solution will help save&#xD;
      significant healthcare costs by reducing the number of plausible future hospitalizations due&#xD;
      to patient complications, providing valuable insights to various stakeholders from doctors to&#xD;
      policymakers on the long-term effects of COVID-19, and improving patient care and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using our team's existing bio-instrumentation technologies and years of experience, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop a custom-designed miniaturized monitoring system capable of&#xD;
      recording pulse oximetry (blood's oxygen level), blood pressure, heart rate and breathing and&#xD;
      swallowing sounds. This solution will be non-invasive, easy to implement and will not require&#xD;
      an assistant physically present. The system will be augmented by regular videoconferencing&#xD;
      sessions with a medical practitioner. The frequency of the connection can be modified&#xD;
      depending on the patient's condition and medical history in consultation with our team's&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By running the proposed project on a large scale, the expected outcomes will be: 1)&#xD;
      collection of reliable and objective information on the long-term impacts of COVID-19, 2)&#xD;
      developing an all-in-one technology for future applications, 3) collection of objective and&#xD;
      actionable information that can be used to optimize care and treatment plans for patients, 4)&#xD;
      better care and treatment for all strata of society regardless of the remoteness of the&#xD;
      residence, and 5) improved mental health and recovery of patients.&#xD;

      residence, and 5) improved mental health and recovery of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to provide COVID-19 survivors a point-of-care facility by using&#xD;
      an interactive virtual program to measure 4 main vital biological signals (blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, pulse oximetry, and respiratory sounds (that include both tracheal and lung&#xD;
      breathing and swallowing sounds) and assess cognitive status of individuals remotely at their&#xD;
      own home. The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assemble the existing and medically approved blood pressure and pulse oximetry&#xD;
           miniaturized non-invasive devices along with a digital stethoscope, all to be connected&#xD;
           to a smart phone operated by a custom-designed app to collect and store data on secure&#xD;
           servers of the PI. One secure server is dedicated to the contact information of the&#xD;
           patients and their unique codes, and another physically separate server is dedicated to&#xD;
           patients' data after anonymizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Schedule videoconferencing sessions for a Research Assistant (RA) to interact with the&#xD;
           patient regularly to help with recording the signals remotely and assess the cognitive&#xD;
           and mood of the patients at their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the above program on 20 COVID-19 patients for a period of 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analyse the collected data during the 4 months observation period, and identify any&#xD;
           consistent pattern of the long-term effect of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Disseminate the results in both scientific and public events, and plan future studies.&#xD;
