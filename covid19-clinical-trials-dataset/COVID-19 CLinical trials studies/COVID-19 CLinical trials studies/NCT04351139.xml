  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current infection with the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is an exceptional health&#xD;
      situation which requires an adaptation of our management practices in gynecological oncology.&#xD;
      Data from the literature suggest that infection with Coronavirus is serious in subjects with&#xD;
      cancer with a risk of severe form 5 times higher than that of the population without cancer&#xD;
      and a risk of death multiplied by 8. In addition, the risk of infection would be 3 times&#xD;
      greater in case of cancer. Faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, the investigator must organize&#xD;
      themselves to ensure continuity in the treatment of patients with gynecological cancer but&#xD;
      also adapt our practices in the management (CPR, teleconsultation, adaptation of treatment or&#xD;
      even postponement of treatment). The objective of the High Council of Public Health is to be&#xD;
      able to ensure adequate oncological care avoiding any potential loss of chance concerning the&#xD;
      care of cancer: people affected must, despite the pandemic, have care allowing the same level&#xD;
      of curability (localized cancers) or the same life expectancy (advanced cancers). This must&#xD;
      be done by limiting as much as possible the impact on the organization of the service, the&#xD;
      organization of patient follow-up and the psychological impact that these possible&#xD;
      modifications could have. The hypotheses of our study are that the exceptional health&#xD;
      situation linked to this pandemic leads to a change in the care of patients with&#xD;
      gynecological cancer associated with a psychological impact and increased anxiety of patients&#xD;
      during their care. Despite the extent of the pandemic, very little existing data makes it&#xD;
      possible to define recommendations with a sufficient level of evidence.&#xD;
