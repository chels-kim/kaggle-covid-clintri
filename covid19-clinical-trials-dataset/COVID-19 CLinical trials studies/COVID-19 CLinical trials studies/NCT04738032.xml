  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic adults are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and 1.5 times more&#xD;
      likely to die from the disease than non-Hispanic whites. These disparities are mediated, in&#xD;
      part, by less healthful levels of physical activity, dietary quality, medication adherence,&#xD;
      and self-monitoring of blood glucose than non-Hispanic whites. Innovative approaches that&#xD;
      arise from affected communities are needed to address these health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been successful in targeting health issues&#xD;
      among Hispanic and immigrant populations; CBPR is an effective approach for addressing health&#xD;
      behaviors in a sociocultural context. In 2004, the research team developed a CBPR partnership&#xD;
      between immigrant communities and academic institutions called Rochester Healthy Community&#xD;
      Partnership (RHCP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storytelling or narrative-based interventions are designed to incorporate culture-centric&#xD;
      health messaging to promote behavior change among vulnerable populations. Digital&#xD;
      storytelling interventions are narrative-based videos elicited through a CBPR approach to&#xD;
      surface the authentic voices of individuals overcoming obstacles toward engaging in health&#xD;
      promoting behaviors to shape positive health behaviors of viewers through influences on&#xD;
      attitudes and beliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RHCP partners from Hispanic communities identified T2D as a priority area for intervention,&#xD;
      and have co-created each of the formative phases leading up to this proposal. Narrative&#xD;
      theory and social cognitive theory formed the conceptual basis for intervention development.&#xD;
      The study team conducted surveys and focus groups to derive the approach and personnel for&#xD;
      building an authentic intervention that was created in a digital storytelling workshop where&#xD;
      stories about diabetes self-management were captured, recorded, and edited to derive the&#xD;
      final intervention products in video forma. The respective digital storytelling videos were&#xD;
      pilot tested with 25 patients across healthcare institutions in Minnesota and Arizona. The&#xD;
      intervention was rated as highly acceptable, culturally relevant, and perceived as&#xD;
      efficacious for motivating behavioral change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is therefore to assess the efficacy of a digital&#xD;
      storytelling intervention derived through a CBPR approach on self-management of T2D among&#xD;
      Hispanic adults during a pandemic.&#xD;

      The study team will conduct an observational trial in a virtual settings at two healthcare&#xD;
      institutions among 80 Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D (hemoglobin A1câ‰¥8%) who&#xD;
      participated in a parent study, but were previously randomized to the Control group. The&#xD;
      participants will view the 12-minute digital storytelling video, as well as completed a brief&#xD;
      survey regarding how the pandemic may have affected their diabetes self-care.&#xD;
