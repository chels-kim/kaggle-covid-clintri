  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to global health. As the disease progresses, a series&#xD;
      of acute complications tend to develop in multiple organs. Beyond the supportive care, no&#xD;
      specific treatment has been established for COVID-19. The effectiveness, both short-term and&#xD;
      long-term, of some promising antivirals, such as the hydroxychloroquine combination with&#xD;
      azithromycin, needs to be evaluated. This study aims to investigate the predictive role of&#xD;
      cardiac biomarkers and pulmonary symptoms for late complications of COVID-19 coronavirus&#xD;
      infection on the heart and lung in patients treated with the hydroxychloroquine /&#xD;
      azithromycin combination therapy. Thus, COVID-19 coronavirus patients undergoing&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin combination therapy will be compared to patients not&#xD;
      undergoing this therapy. The comparison will be made by the analysis of the relationships&#xD;
      between (1) levels of ultrasensitive cardiac troponins collected at the beginning of the&#xD;
      infection and cardiac magnetic resonance data in the 3rd and 12th months of troponin&#xD;
      collection and (2) findings CT scans and the results of the ergospirometers tests performed&#xD;
      in those same periods. It is expected to demonstrate that: (1) cardiac troponin and lung&#xD;
      tomographic findings can predict late complications of COVID-19 coronavirus infection in the&#xD;
      heart and lung, assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance and ergospirometers one year after the&#xD;
      beginning of the infection, and (2) hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin combined therapy can&#xD;
      abolish the onset of these complications late. Furthermore, the results may point to the need&#xD;
      for more rigorous monitoring of cardiologists and pulmonologists of these patients, due to&#xD;
      the risk of hemodynamic complications, arrhythmogenic and respiratory.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive role of cardiac biomarkers and&#xD;
      significant pulmonary complications for late infection complications COVID-19 coronavirus on&#xD;
      the heart and lung in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine / combination therapy&#xD;
      azithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive test patients will be divided into two groups according to therapeutic&#xD;
      conduct. So, with a case-control distribution respecting age and sex, the two patient groups&#xD;
      will be defined as &quot;arm&quot; with therapy (study population) and &quot;Arm&quot; without therapy&#xD;
      (population control). This study is prospective and consists of three times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) T0- Moment of inclusion of the patient in the study, which coincides with the collection&#xD;
      of clinical data and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) T3- In the 3rd month after inclusion in the study, the patient will make a medical visit&#xD;
      where data new laboratory tests will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) T12- In the 12th month after inclusion in the study, the patient will make another&#xD;
      medical visit where data clinical data will be obtained. Laboratory tests, which were altered&#xD;
      during visit T3 will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 coronavirus patients undergoing therapy combined hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin&#xD;
      will be compared to patients not undergoing this therapy. The comparison will be performed by&#xD;
      analyzing the relationships between (1) troponin levels ultrasensitive cardiac data collected&#xD;
      at the beginning of the infection and data of cardiac magnetic resonances in the 3rd and 12th&#xD;
      month of collection troponins and (2) acute tomographic findings and the results the&#xD;
      ergospirometers tests performed in those same periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our understanding of COVID-19, its diagnosis, prevention and treatment are evolving&#xD;
      quickly. As the disease spreads and new evidence emerges, it would be prudent to identify&#xD;
      risk factors for the development of late cardiorespiratory complications in patients&#xD;
      survivors of serious COVID-19 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study of patients with COVID-19, involving a systematic record of&#xD;
      clinical-laboratory variables and chronic cardiorespiratory complications, will be beneficial&#xD;
      for the development of a risk model for these complications and to identify and / or predict&#xD;
      the response to various treatment modalities.&#xD;
