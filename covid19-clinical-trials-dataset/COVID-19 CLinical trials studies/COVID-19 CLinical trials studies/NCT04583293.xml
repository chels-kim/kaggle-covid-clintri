  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational parallel group cohort study that will aim to recruit 220&#xD;
      participants who were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 between 1st March 2020 and 30th&#xD;
      June 2020 (Group A - 110 participants who had COVID-19 with AKI; Group B - 110 participants&#xD;
      who had COVID-19 without AKI). Data from groups A and B will be compared with AKI and non-AKI&#xD;
      groups from an existing study database (ARID study, n=1125) who were recruited before the&#xD;
      outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (recruitment 2013-2016) and who have all completed at least&#xD;
      three years of follow up. Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 will be matched for&#xD;
      analysis to participants from the ARID study for AKI status, baseline estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) stage, age (± 5 years) and presence of diabetes. Potential&#xD;
      participants will receive a letter of invitation along with a comprehensive participant&#xD;
      information sheet (PIS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the participants have read and understand the PIS, and had sufficient time (at least 24&#xD;
      hours) to consider their participation in this study, the investigators will ask them to sign&#xD;
      a consent form, which shows their willingness to take part. The investigators will then&#xD;
      collect information from their medical records about their hospital admission with COVID-19,&#xD;
      including their age, ethnicity, medical conditions, length of hospital stay, tablets or any&#xD;
      other treatments they received, as well as details of their stay in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the two groups - COVID AKI and COVID non-AKI, telephone follow-up with a study&#xD;
      questionnaire will be performed at recruitment, 6-9 months and 12-15 months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge. The study questionnaire will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Details of any medical event and date of medical event since last study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Details of any hospital re-admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Details of current medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, at the same time points, participants will be asked to attend their general&#xD;
      practitioner surgery or other clinic to have simple clinical measurements (height, weight and&#xD;
      blood pressure), blood and urine tests.&#xD;
