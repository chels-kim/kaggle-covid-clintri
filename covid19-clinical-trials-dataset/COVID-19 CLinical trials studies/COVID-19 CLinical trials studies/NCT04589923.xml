  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AIM: We propose an innovative approach using Lifelight® smart technology that will enable the&#xD;
      continued provision of high level patient care at the same time as reducing pressure on&#xD;
      nursing and equipment resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD : Lifelight® is a computer program (&quot;app&quot;) which can be used on smart devices that&#xD;
      contain a camera. It is able to measure all of the vital signs by measuring very small&#xD;
      changes in skin colour that occur each time the heart beats. This means that it does not need&#xD;
      to touch the patient. We believe this could be an effective way of measuring vital signs,&#xD;
      especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when prevention of cross-contamination between&#xD;
      patients is essential. Patients are also likely to be reassured by a contactless approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, we will recruit two groups of people who are hospitalised with an acute&#xD;
      illness. The first group will be people expected to have abnormal blood oxygen levels such as&#xD;
      those with acute respiratory problems including those with COVID-19. The second group will be&#xD;
      people expected to have abnormal blood pressure. These Lifelight vital signs will be compared&#xD;
      to measurements from standard clinical equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact number of participants recruited will depend on how quickly the app &quot;learns&quot; and&#xD;
      how many of the vital signs collected are outside of the normal range. For the first group of&#xD;
      participants, we will use a camera to collect data about the changes in their face and use&#xD;
      this to teach the app how to measure blood oxygen level and also to check how well the app&#xD;
      measures blood oxygen level, heart rate and respiratory rate. For the second group of&#xD;
      participants, we will use a camera to collect data about the changes in their face to check&#xD;
      how well the app measures blood pressure and respiratory rate. All of the data will be kept&#xD;
      secure and participants will not be able to be identified.&#xD;

      Following informed consent, the study staff member will complete a very brief set of&#xD;
      demographic and medical history questions, limited to the presence or absence of medical&#xD;
      problems and treatment for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited into either Group 1 or Group 2 depending on their previous&#xD;
      clinical observations assessed during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 participants will have oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 participants will have blood pressure and respiratory rate measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, the study team will complete a set of pre-measurement observation&#xD;
      questions. Background luminosity will be measured using a handheld lux meter. The staff&#xD;
      member will then prepare for and take the participant's routine observations using standard&#xD;
      clinical equipment during the same 60-second period that video is captured of the&#xD;
      participant's face using Lifelight® Data Collect (from which only the RGB data will be&#xD;
      uploaded to the cloud). These measurements and RGB data capture will be repeated two times&#xD;
      following the initial observations. Once measurements are concluded, the study staff member&#xD;
      will complete the post-measurement observation questions.&#xD;

    <description>Within each study session, participants will have their oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate measured three times using standard of care equipment and methods. At the same time, video of the participant's face will be captured using the Lifelight® Data Collect app running on a tablet positioned opposite them. The app will upload the RGB data extracted from this video to the cloud for subsequent analysis and processing aligned to the study's primary and secondary objectives only. The app does not return any measurements to the user or participant.</description>
