      The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were&#xD;
      first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to worldwide and&#xD;
      presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough,&#xD;
      shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and&#xD;
      deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no&#xD;
      specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hence,&#xD;
      there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia&#xD;
      patients, especially the critically ill cases. The significant clinical outcome and well&#xD;
      tolerance was observed by the adoptive transfer of allogenic MSCs. We proposed that the&#xD;
      adoptive transfer therapy of MSCs might be an ideal choice to be used. We expect to provide&#xD;
      new options for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients and contribute to&#xD;
      improving the quality of life of critically ill patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has been fierce and&#xD;
      spread rapidly. As of 24:00 on March 4, 2020, China has reported a total of 80567 confirmed&#xD;
      cases, 5952 existing critically ill cases, and 3016 dead cases. The COVID-19 pneumonia has&#xD;
      grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to 26 countries worldwide and presented a&#xD;
      serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of&#xD;
      breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly&#xD;
      respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific&#xD;
      drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is&#xD;
      a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 infected patients,&#xD;
      especially the critically ill cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some clinical researches about the COVID-19 published in The Lancet and The New&#xD;
      England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and&#xD;
      capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. Several reports&#xD;
      demonstrated that the first step of the HCoV-19 pathogenesis is that the virus specifically&#xD;
      recognizes the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by its spike Protein. This&#xD;
      receptor is abundant in lung and small intestinal tissues, but is also highly expressed in&#xD;
      vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in almost all organs, including the&#xD;
      nervous system and skeletal muscle. The main organ injured by the HCoV-19 is the lung. In&#xD;
      fact, HCoV-19 can also involve the nervous system, digestive system, urinary system, blood&#xD;
      system and other systems. Therefore, when the initial symptom is discomfort of other systems&#xD;
      in the early stage, it is often easy to be misdiagnosed and delay treatment. Moreover, the&#xD;
      HCoV-19 is a noncellular form consisting of RNA and protein, which cannot be copied&#xD;
      independently. It needs to bind to cell surface receptors to enter the cell to complete the&#xD;
      replication, and then be released again. Therefore, once the HCoV-19 enters the blood&#xD;
      circulation, it can easily spread to all systems throughout the body, which may be the&#xD;
      pathological mechanism that the HCoV-19 directly or indirectly causes neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems that the key to cure the COVID-19 pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response,&#xD;
      resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair&#xD;
      the function of the lung. MSCs, owing to their powerful immunomodulatory ability, may have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application.&#xD;
      They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory&#xD;
      functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. MSCs play&#xD;
      a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation&#xD;
      abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct&#xD;
      interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. Studies have shown that MSCs can&#xD;
      significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing&#xD;
      the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the&#xD;
      lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs)&#xD;
      have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical&#xD;
      controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we conducted an MSC transplantation pilot study to explore their therapeutic potential&#xD;
      for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. To explore the effective treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia for&#xD;
      the current prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia to find a key and effective&#xD;
      clinical treatment means, to fight against the epidemic.&#xD;
