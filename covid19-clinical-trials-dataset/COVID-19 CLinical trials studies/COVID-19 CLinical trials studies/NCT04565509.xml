  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to identify the best messaging and implementation&#xD;
      strategies to maximize SARS-CoV-2 testing for children with intellectual and developmental&#xD;
      disabilities (IDD) and their teachers to help ensure a safe school environment. Additionally,&#xD;
      we will understand nationally the perceptions of COVID-19 and identify facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers to help with the adoption of testing in other parts of the US and the necessary&#xD;
      strategies to address other mitigation strategies including vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will occur at six schools dedicated to children with IDD that are a part&#xD;
      of the Special School Districts in St. Louis, MO. Additionally, surveys, focus groups, and&#xD;
      fuzzy cognitive mapping sessions will be conducted at these six schools and at schools within&#xD;
      the Kennedy Krieger School Programs in Baltimore, MD. Finally, a national survey will be&#xD;
      administered to families, teachers, and staff of the 67 University Centers for Excellence in&#xD;
      Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) which is sponsored by the Association of University&#xD;
      Centers for Disability (AUCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim will involve focus groups of parents/guardians, teachers, and school staff to&#xD;
      identify the barriers and facilitators to frequent SARS-CoV-2 testing, impressions of&#xD;
      COVID-19, and best messages and implementation strategies to promote increase testing and&#xD;
      vaccination. A formal process for developing two types of messages (general versus focused)&#xD;
      will be performed using focus group data and involving key stakeholders to test the messages.&#xD;
      A cluster randomized adaptive clinical trial will then occur at the six special school&#xD;
      district schools. In phase 1, the schools will be randomized initially to either the general&#xD;
      or focused message to promote the adoption of weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing by the students and&#xD;
      teachers. After 5 months, data analysis will be conducted to determine which strategy led to&#xD;
      the highest percentage of testing. Phase 2 will begin at 7 months after the schools are&#xD;
      randomized to either the best message determined from phase 1 or best message plus an&#xD;
      augmented implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim will assess the national perspectives among parents of children with IDD and&#xD;
      school staff regarding the impact of COVID-19 and importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing. Fuzzy&#xD;
      cognitive mapping (FCM) and the administration of local and national surveys will be used to&#xD;
      accomplish this aim. FCM will involve in-person sessions with parents from the 6 schools in&#xD;
      aim 1 and 4 Kennedy Krieger Institute schools in Baltimore, MD for children with IDD. These&#xD;
      sessions will help identify the facilitators and barriers SARS-CoV-2 testing and other&#xD;
      mitigation strategies including COVID-19 vaccine. Since no accepted measures have been&#xD;
      developed for understanding parent and school staff concerns for children with IDD around&#xD;
      COVID-19, local (St. Louis and Baltimore) and national surveys will be conducted. Custom&#xD;
      surveys will be deployed across two stakeholder groups: parent/guardians and school staff. We&#xD;
      will administer the survey at baseline and during the trial across school settings (St. Louis&#xD;
      and Baltimore). A national survey will also be administered across the UCEDDs. Psychometric&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to help identify the questions for a national survey at the end of&#xD;
      the study period. In addition to the custom surveys, NIH recommended parent-report surveys&#xD;
      from the PhenX Toolkit will be used. The surveys to be used include the Psychological Stress&#xD;
      Associated with the COVID-19 Crisis Scale and COVID-19 impact questionnaires.&#xD;
