  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia outbroken in Wuhan, China, which spread quickly to 26&#xD;
      countries worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly&#xD;
      characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some&#xD;
      patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming&#xD;
      inflammation in the lung. Currently, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.&#xD;
      The present clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficacy of Human Umbilical Cord&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for novel coronavirus pneumonia patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)&#xD;
      were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic,&#xD;
      more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total&#xD;
      of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective&#xD;
      treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to&#xD;
      explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in&#xD;
      The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell&#xD;
      infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar&#xD;
      epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It&#xD;
      seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting&#xD;
      to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the&#xD;
      function of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application.&#xD;
      They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory&#xD;
      functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and&#xD;
      H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical&#xD;
      cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their&#xD;
      convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation&#xD;
      rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory&#xD;
      cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly&#xD;
      protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in&#xD;
      treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48&#xD;
      patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell&#xD;
      treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously&#xD;
      treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other&#xD;
      24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung&#xD;
      CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days&#xD;
      mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment.&#xD;
