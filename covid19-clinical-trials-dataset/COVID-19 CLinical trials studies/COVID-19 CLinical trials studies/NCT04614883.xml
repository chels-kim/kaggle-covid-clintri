  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the actual pandemia of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) which requires a better diagnostic strategy for the management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of volatile organic compounds (VOC) detected in exhaled air or in sweat, is an&#xD;
      innovative research area for respiratory diseases. The analysis of VOC can be done either by&#xD;
      the technique of the mass spectrometry which allows the identification of each VOC in the&#xD;
      exhaled air or by the technique of electronic nose, simpler and faster, which provides an&#xD;
      idea of the general profile of the VOC without identifying them. The VOC have shown their&#xD;
      interest in some situations, such as diagnostic or prognostic tool in patients followed for&#xD;
      thoracic tumorous pathology or bronchial or pulmonary vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it has recently been shown that properly trained dogs would be able to detect an&#xD;
      olfactory signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a specificity greater than 90%; this&#xD;
      olfactory signature corresponds to VOCs detectable by the flair of dogs (Nosaïs-Covid19&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of the diagnostic value of VOC analyzes by non-invasive and rapid methods&#xD;
      (electronic nose analysis or mass spectrometry; detection by the scent of dogs) for the rapid&#xD;
      detection and early diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2 infection warrants the performance of this&#xD;
      clinical study.&#xD;
