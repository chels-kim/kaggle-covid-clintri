  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect data on physical activity, food consumption, stress, sleep, and&#xD;
      alcohol consumption habits both before and after the national emergency for COVID-19 was put&#xD;
      into place. This will help identify the health behavior changes taking place due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Data on past and current health behaviors will be&#xD;
      self-reported by participants via a single online survey. The retrospective health behavior&#xD;
      questions will be the same quantitative questions as the current health behavior questions so&#xD;
      a direct comparison can be made. There will be a couple qualitative questions to assess what&#xD;
      each participant feels are the greatest barriers or impacts to their current health&#xD;
      behaviors. Participants will be recruited via convenient sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in this study will show a decline in at least one healthy behavior after the&#xD;
      United States national emergency for COVID-19.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A negative shift in health behaviors when comparing individual health behavior before COVID-19 and the last 7-30 days. This behavior change may be in one or multiple health behaviors measured. A negative shift is indicated by overall decrease in physical activity time or intensity, increase in sitting time, increase in alcohol consumption days or drinks on drinking occasions, a decrease in fruit/vegetable consumption, or indication of consuming more food.</description>
