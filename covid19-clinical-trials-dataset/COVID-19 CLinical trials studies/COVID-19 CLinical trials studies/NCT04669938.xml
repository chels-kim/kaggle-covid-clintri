  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may need intensive care (e.g. mechanical ventilation)&#xD;
      during hospitalization. Some risk factors are already known but better targeting of such&#xD;
      patients is still needed, at least because existing risk factors are not strong enough to&#xD;
      provide an accurate prediction. Care organization would benefit for such a predictive tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal and gut microbiota could potentially fill a significant gap in predictive&#xD;
      performances. The investigators therefore propose to sample 200 patients (oropharyngeal and&#xD;
      rectal swab) admitted in infectious disease department at Bichat Hospital and at high risk of&#xD;
      needing intensive care during hospitalization. The investigators plan to perform metagenomic&#xD;
      sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of these samples to characterize the diversity of&#xD;
      bacterial species present in the oropharynx and the gut and to identify new factors&#xD;
      associated with the need for intensive care. Aside metagenomic analyses, The investigators&#xD;
      will perform semi-quantitative cultures of the oropharyngeal and gut microbiota to identify&#xD;
      and quantify pathogens in order to predict the risk of bacterial infections in COVD-19&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients transferred in intensive care unit, The investigators will to perform another&#xD;
      series of samples to better characterize the evolution of microbiota during mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and identify factors associated with the risk of developing a&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiota data will be considered together with the host genotype, the viral sequence and a&#xD;
      deep immunological profiling to identify the main determinants of the evolution toward&#xD;
      severity of COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may need intensive care (e.g. mechanical ventilation)&#xD;
      during hospitalization. Some risk factors are already known (e.g. sex, comorbidities, initial&#xD;
      clinical presentation inflammatory cytokines), but better targeting of such patients is still&#xD;
      needed, at least because existing risk factors are not strong enough to provide an accurate&#xD;
      prediction. Care organization would benefit for such a predictive tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal and gut microbiota could fill a significant gap in predictive performances. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore propose to take advantage of the French-COVID cohort and sample 200&#xD;
      patients (oropharyngeal and rectal swab) admitted in infectious disease department at Bichat&#xD;
      Hospital and at high risk of needing intensive care during hospitalization. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to perform metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of these samples to&#xD;
      characterize the diversity of bacterial species present in the oropharynx and the gut and to&#xD;
      identify new factors associated with the need for intensive care. Aside metagenomic analyses,&#xD;
      The investigators will perform semi-quantitative cultures of the oropharyngeal and gut&#xD;
      microbiota to identify and quantify pathogens in order to predict the risk of bacterial&#xD;
      infections in COVD-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic determinants of the host (the patient) could also be predictive of the severity&#xD;
      of the disease and so does the immunological response to the COVID-19. Likewise, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that certain mutations (notably the D614G mutation) of the viral sequence could be&#xD;
      associated with the infectivity of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the direct role of the microbiota in the course of infection, the immune&#xD;
      characteristics specific to the host, by themselves or in interaction with the microbiota,&#xD;
      could play an important role in the progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project focuses on the clinical characterization of COVID-19 and its evolution, as well&#xD;
      as disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research focuses on 4 main areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of the oropharyngeal and intestinal microbiota of patients with&#xD;
           COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characteristics of the host (genotype)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune characteristics of the host&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients transferred in intensive care unit, The investigators will to perform another&#xD;
      series of samples to better characterize the evolution of microbiota during mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and identify factors associated with the risk of developing a&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia.&#xD;
