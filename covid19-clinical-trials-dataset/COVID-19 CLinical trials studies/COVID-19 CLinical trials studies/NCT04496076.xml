      A prospective cohort minimal risk study to determine the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on&#xD;
      outcomes of neurologically injured ICU patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID 19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare capacity in many regions around the world. As&#xD;
      resources become more limited and we have to triage /ration ventilators, neurologically&#xD;
      injured ICU patients without COVID 19 but with respiratory insufficiency may be triaged to no&#xD;
      ventilator care due to their perceived or actual prognosis. This may lead to increased rates&#xD;
      of withdrawal of care and mortality. Some neurologically injured ICU patients with&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency may be simultaneously infected with COVID 19. Their outcomes are&#xD;
      completely unknown. Capturing data on the prevalence of limitation of care and prognosis in&#xD;
      this patient population will provide important information towards ongoing efforts in patient&#xD;
      care and resource utilization as we face the rapidly evolving COVID 19 pandemic. Given the&#xD;
      expected strain on ICU resources and limitations in research in ICUs during COVID 19&#xD;
      pandemic, data capture/study design must be targeted and pragmatic. This study is designed to&#xD;
      answer the most basic and important questions while minimizing the burden of data collection&#xD;
      on already overloaded providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design is comprised of two components: Component 1- Prospective cohort prevalence&#xD;
      study captures data related to treatments offered, limitations of care and patient outcome in&#xD;
      5 select primary neurological diagnoses requiring ICU care. Component 2- Case control study&#xD;
      captures the same data elements in the same patient populations during the 3 months prior&#xD;
      COVID 19 pandemic (Sept - Dec, 2019).&#xD;
