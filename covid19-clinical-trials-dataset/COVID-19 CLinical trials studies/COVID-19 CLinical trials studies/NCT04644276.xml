  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To reduce interface leak and aerosol spread, Philips has developed an accessory to&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation(NIV) masks to be used with the Philips AF531 and the PerformaTrak&#xD;
      mask on respiratory failure patients. For the purposes of capturing initial mask leak and&#xD;
      safety data, this trial will enroll patients treated with NIV in an institutional setting&#xD;
      (i.e., sleep lab).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Mask Adhesive will serve as an accessory to the AF531/PerformaTrak masks with the&#xD;
      intention to reduce patient leak while a patient is receiving therapy. This accessory is a&#xD;
      double-sided adhesive; with one side applied directly to the patient's skin and the other&#xD;
      side connected to the mask cushion. Each adhesive is only to be applied to a patient once.&#xD;
      The AF531/Performatrak mask can be removed from the adhesive and then re-applied, as&#xD;
      necessary. For example, if the patient needs to remove the mask to eat or take medicine, the&#xD;
      mask is removed from the patient and the adhesive will stay on the patient's face&#xD;
