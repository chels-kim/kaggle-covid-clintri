    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, 2 arm parallel-group, randomized, interventional prospective&#xD;
      exploratory study in 40 patients aimed to evaluate safety and explore putative clinical&#xD;
      benefits of Silmitasertib 1000 mg BID dose in patients with severe illness caused be&#xD;
      SARS-COV-2. This will be a two-arm trial comparing the SOC/best supportive care alone to the&#xD;
      SOC/best supportive care with addition of Silmitasertib (allocation ratio 1:1).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multi-center, randomized, open-label, 2 arm parallel-group controlled&#xD;
      interventional prospective study of CX-4945 in patients with severe COVID-19. Up to&#xD;
      approximately 40 patients will be enrolled into this study. A screening evaluation will occur&#xD;
      within 7 days prior to Day 1. All qualified patients will be randomized at Day 1 in a ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1 to one of the following two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: SOC/ best supportive care in combination with CX-4945 1000 mg BID PO or Arm B: SOC/&#xD;
      best supportive care alone The standard of care (SOC) is not pre-specified, may vary among&#xD;
      patients, and may include agents with anti-viral activity, such as remdesivir, among others.&#xD;
      Investigator discretion is to be applied for any established SOC. Active concomitant&#xD;
      treatment with other investigational antivirals or immunomodulators are not permitted Best&#xD;
      supportive care is defined as intensive care therapy according to current guidelines,&#xD;
      evidence, and best practice, including but not limited to lung protective ventilation,&#xD;
      thrombosis prophylaxis, renal replacement therapy when indicated, and access to advanced&#xD;
      therapies including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the treatment will be 14 days. Patients will be followed up at 28, 45&#xD;
      and 60 days from the start of the treatment. The total duration for each patient in the study&#xD;
      (including the screening) will be up to 67 days.&#xD;
