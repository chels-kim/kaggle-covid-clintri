  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study D822FC00005 will investigate the Phamacokinetics, Safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib suspension when delivered via a nasogastric tube and co-administered with a&#xD;
      Proton Pump Inhibitor, in the treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to support the ongoing clinical development of acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE®) in&#xD;
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Because many COVID-19 patients may be unable to swallow&#xD;
      capsules due to respiratory failure (eg, they may require endotracheal intubation for&#xD;
      ventilator support and Naso Gastric tube placement), it is important to have a clinically&#xD;
      acceptable method to administer acalabrutinib (capsules) via NG tube. Furthermore, many&#xD;
      hospitalized patients are placed on high doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (also&#xD;
      commonly known as antacid medication). This study is designed to determine the Pharmaco&#xD;
      Kinetics (effect of body/ bodily systems on the drug), safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib suspension, when coadministered with a PPI, in participants with confirmed&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization due to respiratory failure, attributable to&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia and who have an Nasogastric (NG) tube in place.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Data from the CALAVI Phase II trials for Acalabrutinib in patients hospitalized with COVID-19&#xD;
    did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
    Based on this higher management made the decision to prematurely terminate the D822FC00005 PK&#xD;
    study.&#xD;
