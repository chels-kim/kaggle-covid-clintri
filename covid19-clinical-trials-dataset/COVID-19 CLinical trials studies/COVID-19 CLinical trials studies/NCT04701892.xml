  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a serious global public health concern. This disease is&#xD;
      caused by a novel coronavirus which was first discovered in Wuhan, China in 2019 and later&#xD;
      spread rapidly throughout the world. Symptoms of the disease can manifest as fever, cough,&#xD;
      encephalitis, myalgia, fatigue, muscle weakness, arthralgia, anosmia, and impairment in other&#xD;
      bodily functions in the acute phase. In 17% to 67% of cases, COVID-19 patients will develop&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and critical illness. Besides the impact on the&#xD;
      respiratory system, coronaviruses have an effect on other systems including the central&#xD;
      nervous system, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, and gastrointestinal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term central sensitivity syndrome (CSS) describes a group of medically nonspecific&#xD;
      disorders, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome, for&#xD;
      which central sensitivity might be a common etiology. Despite the lack of a solid outcome&#xD;
      measurement, the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was previously introduced as a&#xD;
      screening instrument for clinicians to help identify patients with a CSS. Furthermore,&#xD;
      quantitative sensory testing can be used to identify and quantify sensory disfunctions by&#xD;
      evaluating a variety of parameters including pain thresholds, temporal summation, and&#xD;
      conditioned pain modulation (CPM). Previous research in patients with chronic pain resulted&#xD;
      in less efficacious CPM, increased nociceptive facilitation and decreased pain thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In post covid-19 patients, potential long-term secondary effects on the musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system such as muscle weakness, decreased muscle mass, and myopathies have been brought under&#xD;
      attention. Persisting symptoms are a frequently reported complaint in patients recovered from&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection with at least 1 symptom, particularly fatigue and dyspnea. Fatigue is also&#xD;
      one of the core symptoms in central sensitisation disorders, leading to the hypothesis that&#xD;
      central sensitisation might be the underlying common etiology in chronic pain patients and&#xD;
      patients post COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      there are indicators of central sensitisation in patients post covid-19 infection.&#xD;
