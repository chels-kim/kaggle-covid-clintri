    <textblock>
      In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, a report on ivermectin suppression of SARS-CoV-2 viral&#xD;
      replication in cell cultures has been published, and the use of this medication seems to be&#xD;
      potentially useful for the therapy. IVM safety profile and IVM wide spectrum enables to move&#xD;
      forward with the investigation in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 as a proof-of-concept of&#xD;
      its possible use in the management of patients with COVID-19, given the current pandemic&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ivermectin (IVM) is a semisynthetic antiparasitic agent belonging to the avermectin group,&#xD;
      drugs isolated from Streptomyces avermitilis. Ivermectin is widely used for humans and&#xD;
      animals, with millions of doses annually administered through mass drug distribution programs&#xD;
      held by the World Health Organization (WHO - 2016). Since 1980, Ivermectin has been included&#xD;
      in the Essential Medicines List of the World Health Organization (WHO - 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This medicine is orally administered and is usually used for the treatment against nematodes&#xD;
      and ectoparasites, making this drug the first-choice medication for onchocerciasis, lymph&#xD;
      filariasis, itch and strongylosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, SARS-CoV-2 viral load dynamics has not been clearly determined. However, works&#xD;
      tending to a preliminary characterization of the viral load (VL) behavior have emerged. One&#xD;
      of them, the most substantial one, includes the work done by Kai-Wang showing the VL behavior&#xD;
      during the 30 days before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (Kai-Wang To et al; 2020). In this&#xD;
      work, an average of 7.5 oropharyngeal samples of individuals with severe (n=10) and moderate&#xD;
      (n=13) COVID-19 have been assessed. Time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization&#xD;
      ranged between 0 and 13 days, with a mean of 4 days. VL median at day 0 in all patients was&#xD;
      5.2 log10 copies/mL, and no significant differences between severe and moderate COVID-19&#xD;
      groups occurred. The viral load peak observed during the first week from the onset of&#xD;
      symptoms had a median equal to 6.91 (Q1-Q3: 4.27-7.40) and 5.29 (Q1-Q3: 3.91-7.56) log10&#xD;
      copies/mL in severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, respectively. There was no significant&#xD;
      difference between both groups (p=0.52). Likewise, no difference between patients with and&#xD;
      without comorbidities has been observed (n of patients equal to 12 and 11, respectively) as&#xD;
      per initial VL (p=0.49) and peak VL (p=0.29). However, it has been observed that the VL peak&#xD;
      was directly associated with the age of the patient (R2=0.48 and p=0.02). In a combined&#xD;
      analysis of all patients (n=23), it has been observed that the VL grows in the first days&#xD;
      following the onset of symptoms and that, in the 5-6 days, VL falls sharply, reaching a lower&#xD;
      mean value, yet similar to that of the day 0. General VL behavior from day 9 to 30 showed a&#xD;
      negative slope (VL fall) equal to -0.15 (95% confidence interval: -0.19 to -0.11) log10 per&#xD;
      daya. It must be emphasized that by day 20 from the onset of symptoms, VL mean continues to&#xD;
      be quantifiable (4 log10 copies/mL), and that 7/23 (30%) patients show viral RNA detection&#xD;
      after such day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other paper, the VL of 17 patients with an age median of 59 (range 26-76 years) has been&#xD;
      studied, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Zou et al; 2020). Nonetheless, VL measurement by&#xD;
      nasal swab was performed in 16 patients and quantification was conducted relatively,&#xD;
      expressed in Ct values (cycle threshold), which is related with the VL copies detected in the&#xD;
      molecular reaction: the lower the Ct value, the greater the VL, and vice versa. The feature&#xD;
      worth noting of such work is that VL dynamics varies widely from one patient to another.&#xD;
      Contrary to the work of Kai-Wang To et al. [1], the VL peak seems to occur earlier (first&#xD;
      three days), whereas the sharp VL fall is at day 6 approximately, from which day the VL is&#xD;
      undetectable in most patients. Only very few patients show detectable viral RNA after 10 days&#xD;
      from the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other work, pharyngeal swabs performed in 67 patients have been studied (Pan et al; 2020).&#xD;
      VL dynamics similar to that reported by Kai-Wang To et al. is observed, with a VL of&#xD;
      approximately 4 to 5 log10 copies/mL at day 0 of the onset of symptoms, a peak at day 6/7 (8&#xD;
      log10 copies/mL) and a sharp fall from day 8 of the onset of symptoms. A temporary onset of&#xD;
      viremia is observed with a VL of 4 log10 copies/mL up to day 15 from the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in the work published by Wölfel et al. [4] much more accelerated dynamics than that&#xD;
      in the work of Kai-Wang To et al. and Pan et al. (Wölfel et al; 2020) is observed, and the&#xD;
      peak appearing much earlier than the day 4 from the onset of symptoms in the nine studied&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, in 8 patients, the VL falls sharply reaching values below the&#xD;
      quantification limit (2 log10 copies/mL) at day 10-11 following the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
      Although there are transient VL relapses after day 10, this value remains very close to the&#xD;
      study quantification limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, if the works of Kai-Wang and Pan are considered, a greater viral RNA half-life&#xD;
      is expected at day 10 following the onset of symptoms. Even though in the works of Zou and&#xD;
      Wölfel the peak occurs much earlier than the first five days and viral negativity occurs&#xD;
      after day 10-11 following the onset of symptoms. Method variability among the many works is a&#xD;
      limiting factor when comparing the outcomes. That is why, due to the sample size in Kai Wang&#xD;
      et al (n=23) and Zou et al (n=67), it is suggested to use these works as reference and to&#xD;
      consider the works of Pan (n=17) and Wölfel (n=9) as part of behavior diversity. It is&#xD;
      important to define the period in which therapy is to be initiated from the onset of symptoms&#xD;
      so that the sharp fall observed post-peak is not a factor that biases the potential antiviral&#xD;
      effect of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these backgrounds along with the preliminary study with ivermectin, it is not&#xD;
      possible to define a specific, progressive outcome for the reduction of the VL, but it may be&#xD;
      expressed in a variation percentage with respect to the control population (without therapy)&#xD;
      at the end of treatment. This percentage difference between the treated population and the&#xD;
      untreated population must be greater than the variation observed for the study day or period&#xD;
      in the patients included in the above mentioned works, since such percentage difference would&#xD;
      replicate the behavior in our control population.&#xD;
