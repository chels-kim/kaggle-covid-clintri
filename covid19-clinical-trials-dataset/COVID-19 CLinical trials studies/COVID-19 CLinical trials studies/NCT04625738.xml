    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of potential help in acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS), due to their anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the effect of 3 iterative infusions of ex vivo expanded&#xD;
      Wharton's Jelly MSCs (total dose 2.10^6/kg) in patients with ARDS due to COVID19, who require&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to analyze the impact of Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stem Cells on&#xD;
      moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID19 in adult patients who require mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      It is a Phase IIa double-blind randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized and will receive, with the conventional treatment recommended to&#xD;
      treat ARDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either Wharton's Jelly MSCs in a solution of albumin 4% (40% of final volume), NaCl 0,9%&#xD;
           (50% of the final volume) et ACD formule A (10% of the final volume) . Treatment will be&#xD;
           administered intravenously during 10 minutes following that scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 0 (or 1): 1. 10^6 MSC/kg (maximum 80.10^6 MSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 3 (or 4): 0.5 . 10^6 MSC/kg (maximum 40. 10^6 MSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 5 (or 6): 0.5 . 10^6 MSC/kg (maximum 40. 10^6 MSC) An interval of 2 days will&#xD;
                be respected between 2 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either a placebo, which contains the same solution of albumin, NaCl 0.9% and ACD without&#xD;
           cells. The volume will be of 75 ml, infused in 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to investigate efficacy of WJ-MSCs, compared to a placebo, on&#xD;
      respiratory function evolution during the first 14 days of study treatment in patients with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 related moderate to severe ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of WJ-MSC, compared to placebo, in patients&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 related moderate to severe ARDS, on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation during the hospital stay and maximum for&#xD;
           28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the evolution of organ failures during the hospital stay and maximum for 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the duration of stay in intensive care unit, the mortality during intensive care unit,&#xD;
           during hospitalization, on D28 and D90, and the respiratory morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the evolution of viral load between D0 and D28&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the immediate or delayed tolerance following the WJ-MSCs injection&#xD;
