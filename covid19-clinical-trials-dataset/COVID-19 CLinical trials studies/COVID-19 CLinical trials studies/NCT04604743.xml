  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 30-month study, the investigators propose to develop a culturally appropriate vaccine&#xD;
      confidence intervention, targeting positive change related to HPV vaccine uptake behavior and&#xD;
      reducing sentiments of hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine, that can be seamlessly&#xD;
      integrated into the existing environment of pediatric and family practice clinics in rural&#xD;
      Alabama. To do so, the investigators will first assess stakeholders' knowledge, sentiments,&#xD;
      and beliefs related to vaccination in general, a COVID-19 vaccination, and the HPV&#xD;
      vaccination. The investigators will also assess stakeholders' perceptions of barriers to&#xD;
      vaccination that exist in rural Alabama. This will occur in Aim 1. Then, in Aim 2, the&#xD;
      investigators will use these data to inform the development of a non-invasive, modular&#xD;
      synchronous counseling intervention targeting 15-17 year old adolescents (rationale for this&#xD;
      age range presented later in this proposal). After the intervention has been finalized, in&#xD;
      our final aim, Aim 3, we will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation cluster&#xD;
      randomized control trial to assess intervention acceptability and feasibility (N=4 clinics;&#xD;
      N=120 adolescents), while also assessing for a &quot;clinical signal&quot; of effectiveness. To support&#xD;
      dissemination and scale up, also during Aim 3, we will document implementation contexts to&#xD;
      provide real-world insight. To do this, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews&#xD;
      with the same groups of stakeholders that we interviewed in Aim 1.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will target adolescents aged 15-17 years who have not received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. The intervention has yet to be named; this will occur through the conduct of Aim 1. Our intervention, when developed, will improve knowledge of HPV, COVID-19, the HPV vaccine, and the COVID-19 vaccine (Information), reduce stigma and distrust improving motivation (Motivation), leading to improved vaccine confidence and higher vaccination rates and lower vaccine hesitancy (Behavioral Skills). Each one of these three change objectives will be encapsulated in its own Zoom-based session with the near peer interventionist. We anticipate that each modular session will be no longer than seven minutes; thus, the entire three module intervention will be no longer than twenty-one minutes long.</description>
