  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study is to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in hospitalized adult (18-99 years old) patients with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen and have serologic markers of&#xD;
      inflammation but do not need mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      The purpose of this randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled Phase 2b study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in hospitalized adult (18-99 years old) male&#xD;
      and female patients with SARS-CoV-2 and pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen and have&#xD;
      serologic markers of inflammation but do not need mechanical ventilation (see Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria). Sixty patients will be recruited to receive tofacitinib or placebo in addition to&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened during hospitalization. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection, and meeting all other Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, will be randomized to&#xD;
      either treatment with tofacitinib or placebo in addition to SOC during hospitalization (dose&#xD;
      adjusted, if required), with the exception of pre-specified immunomodulatory agents (as&#xD;
      documented in the inclusion/exclusion criteria). Tofacitinib will be administered in a dose&#xD;
      of 10 mg PO BID until return to their clinical baseline (as defined by need for supplementary&#xD;
      oxygen), and will continue to be administered at 5 mg PO BID for a total duration of therapy&#xD;
      of 14 days; follow-up off tofacitinib will continue up to Day 90. We anticipate completion of&#xD;
      subject recruitment in 6 months.&#xD;
