    <textblock>
      In this study, clinically cured patients with severe COVID-19 were used to evaluate the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of COVID-19 and the recovery and health status of patients over time with&#xD;
      highly sensitive PET/CT imaging technology. At the same time, PET/CT whole body scan, dynamic&#xD;
      imaging and mathematical dynamic model were combined to evaluate the functions of the heart,&#xD;
      lung, liver, kidney, brain and other important organs and the outcome of inflammatory lesions&#xD;
      in clinically cured COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19), referred to as &quot;COVID-19&quot;, refers to the&#xD;
      pneumonia caused by novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-NCOV/SARS-COV-2) infection. The clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of the new patients were fever, fatigue and dry cough, while the symptoms of&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract such as nasal congestion and runny nose were rare. Hypoxia occurs.&#xD;
      About half of the patients developed dyspnea after one week, and in severe cases, the rapid&#xD;
      progression was acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis that&#xD;
      was difficult to correct, and coagulation dysfunction. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      China, the National Health Commission issued the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for COVID-19.&#xD;
      By analyzing the epidemic situation and research progress, it organized experts to timely&#xD;
      revise the diagnosis and treatment plan based on the analysis, study and summary of the&#xD;
      previous medical treatment work.The discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients notified by the&#xD;
      National Health Commission are remission of clinical symptoms, normal body temperature,&#xD;
      normal CT, and negative nucleic acid tests for both tests. So far, the COVID-19 epidemic in&#xD;
      China has been well under control. According to the latest statistics, 84,311 cases have been&#xD;
      confirmed in total, and 1,433 cases have been confirmed so far.But studies (the latest from&#xD;
      Dena Goffman's team, published in the NEJM) suggest that as many as 88 percent of coVID-19&#xD;
      patients are asymptomatic. Do cured patients leave the hospital with a percentage of&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients?In addition, covid-19 cured patients in some regions turned positive&#xD;
      again after discharge, indicating that long-term follow-up monitoring is of great&#xD;
      significance for cured and discharged patients in addition to routine isolation&#xD;
      observation!Moreover the literature at home and abroad other viral infections (such as&#xD;
      hepatitis b, HIV, etc.) to cure patients found that the virus may lurk for a long time, the&#xD;
      virus quantity contained in a very low level, the conventional detection method is difficult&#xD;
      to detect, at the appropriate incentives can lead to attack, so for the new crown cure&#xD;
      patients need close monitoring of systemic inflammation related lesions, and the situation of&#xD;
      the latent virus.However, we still face many problems and challenges. For example, according&#xD;
      to the latest data published by Dena Goffman's team in NEJM, the proportion of asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients is as high as 88%, so the screening of asymptomatic patients is crucial.In many&#xD;
      places, COVID-19 patients cured turn positive again after discharge. Therefore, it is of&#xD;
      great significance to explore the mechanism of COVID-19 turning negative after discharge and&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of novel Coronavirus and COVID-19 on patients' later recovery. Explore&#xD;
      and develop more efficient and sensitive clinical detection methods to evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      effect of covid-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission computed tomography imaging technique is a nuclear medicine clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of advanced imaging techniques, can be shown on the in vivo biological molecules&#xD;
      (such as 18 F- FDG, tracer nuclide labeled glucose molecules) metabolism, receptors and&#xD;
      neurotransmitter activity of new functional imaging techniques, has been widely used in many&#xD;
      kinds of disease diagnosis and differential diagnosis, a judgment, curative effect&#xD;
      evaluation, viscera function research and development of new drugs, etc. Compared with&#xD;
      traditional anatomical structure imaging, functional imaging PET has the following&#xD;
      advantages: (1) High sensitivity. According to the test, PET molecular probe can pick up&#xD;
      molecular events at the level of PM-NM in vivo. (2) High specificity, for the PET selected&#xD;
      molecular probe, can only imaging the target molecules, for the same family of receptors,&#xD;
      because the binding degree difference can be specifically distinguished; (3) Whole-body&#xD;
      imaging, that is, one time PET imaging can obtain images of all regions of the whole body,&#xD;
      and through the analysis can obtain the dynamic information of the metabolic changes of human&#xD;
      tissues over time, which is of great significance for the research, prevention and evaluation&#xD;
      of diseases.In particular, PET/CT scan provides a more reliable means of systemic monitoring&#xD;
      for viruses that are lurking in all hidden parts of the body. (4) Security is good, although&#xD;
      there are some radioactive nuclide PET need, but the amount of nuclide rarely used with short&#xD;
      half-life, through two aspects of physical decay and biological metabolism function, in a&#xD;
      very short time, client retention, a PET general inspection of radiation dose is far less&#xD;
      than the conventional CT examination of a part, and safe and reliable.&#xD;
