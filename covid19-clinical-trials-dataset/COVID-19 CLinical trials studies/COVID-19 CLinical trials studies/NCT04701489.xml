      The research objective of the UNITE Study is to assess the potential efficacy of ultrasound&#xD;
      application to the spleen in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the efficacy of splenic ultrasound in affecting markers of systemic&#xD;
           inflammation in COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the potential efficacy of splenic ultrasound in affecting clinical outcomes in&#xD;
           COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is widely used in human medicine because it is safe, non-invasive, and painless.&#xD;
      The same kind of ultrasound that is used for imaging (for example, to visualize babies in&#xD;
      utero) may be able to treat inflammatory diseases including COVID-19. COVID-19 is a disease&#xD;
      caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe&#xD;
      respiratory disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome and this disease is caused, in&#xD;
      part, by a significant increase in inflammatory factors. Clinical therapies that reduce this&#xD;
      elevated inflammation in the body (e.g., inflammation molecules in your body called&#xD;
      cytokines) may be capable of diminishing symptoms in severe cases of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies in animals with hyper-inflammation conditions (e.g., inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      and sepsis/LPS injections) and recent human studies (e.g., for the treatment of joint&#xD;
      inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis) have shown that ultrasound applied to the spleen can&#xD;
      suppress blood/genetic markers of inflammation. Similar inflammatory markers, or cytokines,&#xD;
      are elevated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and believed to cause severe symptoms. Splenic&#xD;
      ultrasound can potentially lower these inflammatory cytokines without hindering antibody&#xD;
      production, leading to clinical improvements in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ ultrasound devices produced by General Electric (GE LOGIQ E10 device&#xD;
      with C1-6 ultrasound probe) that are currently used in hospitals and approved for diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging by the FDA. The ultrasound energies applied to the spleen in this study in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients will not exceed what is currently approved for diagnostic imaging with those GE&#xD;
      ultrasound devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups in this study with 15 participants in each group. One group will&#xD;
      receive ultrasound application to the spleen, in addition to the standard clinical care. A&#xD;
      control group will receive standard clinical care without splenic ultrasound. Each ultrasound&#xD;
      application session will last about 15-20 minutes per day for 7 days, unless the participant&#xD;
      is discharged sooner. For ultrasound stimulation, a small gel-coated probe is positioned on&#xD;
      the upper left abdomen area over the ribs. The ultrasound session includes a period of 5-10&#xD;
      minutes when study personnel use the ultrasound device to locate the spleen and to position&#xD;
      the ultrasound probe in a proper location around the ribs area, and an approximately&#xD;
      10-minute period for application of ultrasound to the spleen. Collection of clinical outcome&#xD;
      data and daily blood draws will be performed in each participant throughout the study.&#xD;
      Additional data collected from each participant during their routine clinical care beyond&#xD;
      their study involvement will also be analyzed together with the study data to evaluate the&#xD;
      specific aims of the clinical trial.&#xD;
