  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is concern that wearing a face mask during COVID will affect oxygen uptake, especially&#xD;
      during intense exercise. This study will assess the effect of wearing two different face&#xD;
      masks (disposable and cloth) on blood and muscle oxygenation during cycling exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is concern that wearing a face mask during exercise will reduce oxygen uptake or&#xD;
      increase carbon dioxide re-breathing, which can result in low blood oxygen levels, reduced&#xD;
      oxygen delivery to muscle and reduced exercise capacity. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of wearing two different types of commonly-worn face masks (diposable&#xD;
      and cloth) during exercise on blood and muscle oxygenation. Twelve participants who are&#xD;
      experienced with cycling will take part in this randomized cross-over study that will assess&#xD;
      blood oxygenation (i.e. pulse oximetry) and muscle oxygenation (with near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy) during a progressive step exercise test to exhaustion. The conditions include&#xD;
      no mask, a disposable mask, and a cloth mask. Outcome variables include exercise duration,&#xD;
      rating of perceived exertion, blood oxygen saturation levels, and oxygenated, deoxygenated,&#xD;
      and total hemoglobin at the quadriceps muscle.&#xD;
