  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded RNA coronavirus. The virus was first&#xD;
      isolated from patients presented with pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019. Sequences of the&#xD;
      Wuhan betacoronavirus show similarities to betacoronaviruses found in bats, sharing a common&#xD;
      ancestor with the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the bat coronavirus HKU9, a virus&#xD;
      found in fruit bats. Similar to SARS-CoV, it is a member of Beta-CoV lineage B. Five genomes&#xD;
      of the novel coronavirus have been initially isolated and reported including&#xD;
      BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019,&#xD;
      BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019, and BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019 from the China CDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 has since spread from China to the rest of the world. As of 5 April 2020, more&#xD;
      than 1.05 million people been confirmed to have infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in more&#xD;
      than 500,000 deaths. No specific antiviral treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 is currently&#xD;
      available, but existing medication could be repurposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic sequencing demonstrated similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-CoV and MERS CoV.2&#xD;
      We expect patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 will also present similarly with initial&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract symptoms including fever, cough, sputum, myalgia and shortness or&#xD;
      breath. More severe cases might complicate with pneumonia and required ventilatory or ECMO&#xD;
      support. According to our previous studies in 2003 on patients hospitalized for severe&#xD;
      SARS-CoV, the viral load peaked between day 7 from symptoms onset and coincided with clinical&#xD;
      deterioration of pneumonia and respiratory failure, with majority of the patients required&#xD;
      intensive care support. Higher viral load isolated from different human system also&#xD;
      correlated with worsened SARS manifestation and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the investigators have demonstrated that interferon-beta 1b, commonly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of multiple sclerosis and lopinavir/ ritonavir, also demonstrated to improve the&#xD;
      outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a non-human primate model of common marmoset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-randomized trial has also suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and&#xD;
      azithromycin might be effective in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients, despite&#xD;
      in-vitro activity was only found in hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose to conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial on&#xD;
      a short course of interferon β-1b and hydroxychloroquine combination treatment for patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

      This is a prospective open-label randomised controlled trial among adult patients&#xD;
      hospitalised after April 2020 for virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group: a 3-day course of 3 doses&#xD;
      of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL (0.25mg; 8 million IU) consecutively on day&#xD;
      1 to day 3 and hydroxychloroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg daily for 2 days plus standard&#xD;
      care, or the control group: a 3-day course of hydroxycholoroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg&#xD;
      daily for 2 days plus standard care alone (1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group, if the day 4 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) viral load remains positive,&#xD;
      then patients will receive another 3 days of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL&#xD;
      (0.25mg; 8 million IU) and hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily.&#xD;
