  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Countries that have not carried out universal mass vaccination against tuberculosis (BCG)&#xD;
      have been shown to have higher incidence and death rates due to COVID-19 than countries with&#xD;
      mass, long-term BCG immunization programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does BCG vaccination affect the course of COVID-19 (number of cases/deaths/severity of&#xD;
           symptoms)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will the course of COVID-19 be milder among subjects with a negative TB skin test (PPD&#xD;
           RT 23 SSI) after an additional dose of BCG than in case of non-vaccinated subjects?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do people with a positive TB skin test have a milder course of COVID-19 infection than&#xD;
           people with a negative test result?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in&#xD;
      Rzeszow/Krakow/ Katowice/Warsaw on a group of 1000 volunteers, health care workers according&#xD;
      to the following schedule: V 0-1: inclusion/informed consent/interview; V2: administration of&#xD;
      TB skin test/anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test/serum banking*; V3: TB skin test (TST) interpretation&#xD;
      and subjects' division into three groups: (I) positive TST - observation; (II) negative TST-&#xD;
      BCG-10 vaccination; (III) negative TST - placebo. Division into groups II and III based on&#xD;
      randomisation; V4: serum banking*. Parallel beginning from V3, weekly telephone monitoring&#xD;
      participants' health status; In case of COVID-19 symptoms a nasopharyngeal swab to confirm&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection + serum banking*. V5: 3 months after vaccination at the end of the&#xD;
      study: history/anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, serum banking*.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis - comparison of the course of COVID-19 in groups: (I) with positive TST&#xD;
      + observation, (II) with negative TST + BCG, (III) with negative TST + placebo - should&#xD;
      demonstrate whether mass BCG vaccination has an impact on the incidence and course of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * to measure the level of cytokines involved in cell-mediated immunity process&#xD;

      and declarations of intent between the centre (investigator) and the individual declaring&#xD;
      readiness to participate in research with double verification of the subject identity&#xD;
      /e-mail+SMS/, which is intended to limit direct contacts during the period of COVID-19&#xD;
      epidemic risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion in the trial (visit No.1 - V1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator-subject telephone contact (in the days following V0 or directly during the&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  temperature measurement (non-contact thermometer), blood sampling (5 ml) for&#xD;
           determinations of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  photographing the scars after BCG vaccination on the left forearm of the subject&#xD;
           (without the details of appearance); the photographs are stored in the electronic&#xD;
           documentation with the number assigned to a particular subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RT 23 trial initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  providing the subject with the written informed consent form, participant card, as well&#xD;
           as the card of contacts, thermometer, and pregnancy test (females) in a sealed plastic&#xD;
           envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the visit will be carried out in accordance with the procedures in force in departments&#xD;
           of infectious diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  setting the date (date and time) of the third visit- after 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after the visit, the investigator will enter its results into the medical documentation&#xD;
           and e-CRF system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT23 test reading and BCG -10 vaccination (visit No.3-V3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the direct visit, preceded by the telephone contact to confirm the subject's health&#xD;
           status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before the visit, the female subjects perform a pregnancy test in the morning hours;&#xD;
           those with positive results are excluded from the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  temperature measurement (non-contact thermometer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the visit will be carried out in accordance with the procedures in force in departments&#xD;
           of infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reading of the tuberculin test run during visit 2 (according to the criteria) and&#xD;
           photographing the post-test induration on the left arm of the subject (for documentation&#xD;
           purposes), no appearance details; the photos are stored in the electronic documentation&#xD;
           marked with the number given to a particular study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are assigned to Group I, are not randomised and are not vaccinated against tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are subjected to a weekly remote medical follow-ups in agreement with the &quot;telephone&#xD;
           contact card&quot; until the trial completion (3 months from the date of visit 3 of the last&#xD;
           subject); the follow ups are conducted by the investigator, a member of the research&#xD;
           team, not participating in visit 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  when the RT23 test indicates a strongly positive result /induration diameter &gt; 15 mm/,&#xD;
           the subject is informed to contact his/her family doctor to obtain a referral to a&#xD;
           pulmonary outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo a physical examination before vaccination performed by the doctor (investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are remotely randomised by the e-CRF IT system to Group II receiving BCG-10 or to&#xD;
           placebo Group III (control). The subject must not be informed about the group he/she&#xD;
           belongs to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive BCG-10 or a placebo in intradermal injections performed by a trained nurse with&#xD;
           appropriate professional experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo weekly remote medical observations carried out by the investigator not involved&#xD;
           in visit 3, according to the &quot;telephone contact card&quot;, until the trial completion (3&#xD;
           months from the date of visit 3 of the last subject) Due to trial blindness, the team (a&#xD;
           doctor and nurse) participating in visits 2 (V2) and 3 (V3) (as unblinded staff) is&#xD;
           excluded from further contacts with trial subjects and from participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the visit, the investigator enters its results into the medical documentation and the&#xD;
      e-CRF system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the medical records of visit 3 (written and electronic), the result of randomization is&#xD;
      not disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After visit 3, the division of subjects into Groups II and III (randomisation) is recorded&#xD;
      only in separate written records; the physician participating in visit 2 and 3 sends the&#xD;
      documentation to the leading centre after the end of visit 3, where it is stored and fully&#xD;
      protected against access of blinded personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection - visit No. 4 (V4):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  within 6-8 weeks after visit 3, all subjects are invited by telephone to the place&#xD;
           designated by the Principal Investigator to take 5 ml blood samples to determine the&#xD;
           levels of cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood collection is carried out by a member of the research team appointed by the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after the visit, the investigator enters its results into the e-CRF system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection - visit No. 5 (V5):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  three months after visit 3, all subjects are invited by telephone to the place&#xD;
           designated by the Principal Investigator to take 5 ml blood samples to determine&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and cytokine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood collection is carried out by a member of the research team appointed by the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after the visit, the investigator enters its results into the medical documentation and&#xD;
           the e-CRF system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote phone visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      • carried out for a period of three months between visit 3 (V3) and visit 5 (V5), once a&#xD;
      week; during this visit the physician (member of the research team) asks questions according&#xD;
      to the attached phone contact card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will be carried out between visit 3 and visit 5, when the symptoms determined in the&#xD;
           telephone Contact card appear to indicate a possible SARS-CovV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the trial subject contacts by telephone the investigator conducting a weekly remote&#xD;
           medical observation, and if the score 3 is obtained during the telephone evaluation of&#xD;
           health, the mobile team is deployed to the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the ambulance takes a swab from the subject's nasopharynx and collects 5 ml of blood for&#xD;
           cytokine determinations to confirm the infection with this virus or otherwise. The visit&#xD;
           will be carried out at the subject's place of residence and the material collected will&#xD;
           be delivered to a respective analytical laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after the visit, the investigator will enter its results into the medical documentation&#xD;
           and the e-CRF system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each subject may contact the research centre by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each subject may withdraw from the trial at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  when the telephone contact with the subject is infeasible, the research team may use the&#xD;
           reserve contact indicated by the subject or contact the hospital attending the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the subject develops the symptoms of COVID-19 during the trial, he/she has to adhere&#xD;
           to the generally applicable rules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the end of the study, all subjects in groups II and III will be notified&#xD;
           (individually and confidentially) whether they have received BCG-10 or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  when a preliminary result indicates the significant benefits of additional BCG&#xD;
           vaccination, an additional dose of BCG-10 will be offered to all non-vaccinated&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be conducted using MedCalc v17.7 software. The&#xD;
      quantitative variables will be presented as an arithmetic mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      (variables with a normal distribution) or median and interquartile range (variables with a&#xD;
      non-normal distribution/ a skewed distribution). The distribution will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. The qualitative variables will be presented as an absolute value and&#xD;
      percentage. The inter-group differences for quantitative variables will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      Student's t-test or analysis of variance (independent samples, variables with a normal&#xD;
      distribution), and the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test (independent samples, skewed&#xD;
      variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where significant inter-group differences have been demonstrated based on the ANOVA&#xD;
      or Kruskal-Wallis test, a post-hoc analysis will be performed. The significance of&#xD;
      differences for quantitative dependent variables will be assessed applying the Student t-test&#xD;
      for dependent samples or the non-parametric equivalent of variance analysis, or the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank or Friedman's rank test (depending on the number of groups and the distribution).&#xD;
      For unrelated qualitative variables, the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be&#xD;
      used, while for related variables the McNemar's test will be applied. The correlation between&#xD;
      inter-qualitative variables will be analysed using the Pearson correlation analysis or&#xD;
      Spearman's rank correlation. For selected qualitative dependencies for quality dichotomous&#xD;
      variables, the odds ratios (or relative risk factors) and their 95% confidence intervals will&#xD;
      be calculated. The results of simple analyses will be the basis for advanced statistical&#xD;
      analysis methods, i.e. logistic regression models or multiple regression analyses. Models&#xD;
      will include variables with p&lt;0.1 in simple analysis will be included in the models mentioned&#xD;
      above. Moreover, the odds ratios together with 95% confidence intervals (logistic regression)&#xD;
      or regression coefficients with their standard error (multiple regression) will be estimated.&#xD;
      Finally, p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum number of trial subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A/ Assuming that 50% of individuals have negative tuberculin test results when alpha=0.05 and&#xD;
      measurement precision=5%, a group of at least 384 subjects (~400) should be recruited.&#xD;
      Assuming a 10 % loss of subjects between the initiation and reading of the tuberculin test,&#xD;
      the group subjected to the tuberculin test should contain at least 450 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/ Assuming a 10% difference in endpoint occurrence (disease) when alpha=0.05 is expected, at&#xD;
      least 193 individuals in each group (~200) should be examined. Given the loss to follow -up&#xD;
      of 10 %, each group (study and control) should include at least 220 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C/ In conclusion, considering all the above calculations, at least 880 individuals (~900)&#xD;
      should be included in the trial. Given that 10% of subjects will not give their informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the trial, at least 990 individuals (~1000) should be invited to&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Six weeks after the inclusion of the last subject, the number of serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) in each group is to be analysed in order to decide whether to continue the follow-up&#xD;
      or to administer the BCG vaccine to all non-vaccinated subjects.&#xD;

           SARS-CoV-2 virus, and cytokine levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. if COVID-19 symptoms occur in the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the subject eligible for hospitalisation will be urgently (emergently) hospitalised&#xD;
                due to COVID-19 and tested according to the procedures in force in the hospital;&#xD;
                moreover, each subject will receive an identifier (similar to ID) with information&#xD;
                about participation in the trial and a request to the personnel assuming care of&#xD;
                the subject to inform the research team and secure samples (5 ml of blood for&#xD;
                cytokine determination and a swab from the nasopharynx for the SARS-CovV-2 genetic&#xD;
                material testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. in the case of the subject not eligible for hospitalisations with symptoms&#xD;
                suggestive of the infection but not requiring hospitalisation, symptoms and their&#xD;
                duration will be noted and during the intervention visit 5 ml of blood will be&#xD;
                sampled for cytokine determinations and a nasopharyngeal swab will be taken for&#xD;
                testing whether SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is present or otherwise. The material&#xD;
                will be collected at the subject's home in accordance with the safety procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Methodology of laboratory tests Laboratory blood tests for determinations of&#xD;
                SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and cytokine levels will be carried out..&#xD;
&#xD;
                Procedure - collection and transport of material to the laboratory preparing it for&#xD;
                banking&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS CoV-2 genetic material testing using&#xD;
                the RT-qPCR test and blood sampling to assess cytokine and/or IgG levels&#xD;
&#xD;
                Criteria for completion of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
                According to its program, the trial will last for a period of 3 months from the&#xD;
                date of visit No. 3 (administration of the vaccine) to the date of visit 5 (blood&#xD;
                collection for determinations of IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokine levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Over the next 15 months, the subjects will be asked to provide the Research Team&#xD;
                with telephone information about possible hospitalizations and other unexpected,&#xD;
                sudden or significant changes in their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The trial will be completed after the last visit of the last subject and after the&#xD;
                results serological and genetic tests (PCR-SARS) are available, approximately 8&#xD;
                months after its initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The observation of possible SAEs reported by the subjects will be completed 18&#xD;
                months after the commencement of the trial.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to trial blindness, the team (a doctor and nurse) participating in visits 2 (V2) and 3 (V3) (as unblinded staff) is excluded from further contacts with trial subjects and from participating in the trial.&#xD;
After the visit, the investigator enters its results into the medical documentation and the e-CRF system.&#xD;
In the medical records of visit 3 (written and electronic), the result of randomization is not disclosed.&#xD;
After visit 3, the division of subjects into Groups II and III (randomisation) is recorded only in separate written records; the physician participating in visit 2 and 3 sends the documentation to the leading centre after the end of visit 3, where it is stored and fully protected against access of blinded personnel.&#xD;
The subject must not be informed about the group he/she belongs to.</masking_description>
