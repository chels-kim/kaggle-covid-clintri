  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province,&#xD;
      China. An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due&#xD;
      to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred and the disease, now&#xD;
      termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China and all over the world.&#xD;
      A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV,&#xD;
      was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease.&#xD;
      The causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded&#xD;
      positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV).&#xD;

      Selected Drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (an analog of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV&#xD;
      activity in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of&#xD;
      chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose and has fewer concerns about&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions. Hydroxychloroquine has long-term safety (600 mg/day for 12 to 18&#xD;
      months was safe). Hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the&#xD;
      post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine, and one study found&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      vitro. Hydroxychloroquine acts as a weak base that can change the pH of acidic intracellular&#xD;
      organelles including endosomes/lysosomes, essential for the membrane fusion. Besides, the&#xD;
      significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines with&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine has made this agent a successful disease modifying anti-inflammatory agent&#xD;
      in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. An additional issue to be considered in&#xD;
      severely sick patients is cytokine storm associated with disease severity of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no currently available data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to inform&#xD;
      clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of Hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or&#xD;
      treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although optimal dosing and duration of Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally&#xD;
      different Hydroxychloroquine dosing such as 400 mg twice daily on day one, then daily for 5&#xD;
      days; 400 mg twice daily on day one, then 200 mg twice daily for 4 days; 600 mg twice daily&#xD;
      on day one, then 400 mg daily on days 2-5. In a recent clinical trial, Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days was used in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide is originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent and has a broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antiviral activity undergoing development for the treatment of influenza and other viral&#xD;
      respiratory infections. In addition to its antiviral activity, Nitazoxanide inhibits the&#xD;
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nitazoxanide could improve outcomes in patients infected&#xD;
      with MERS-CoV by suppressing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6.&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide has been tested in clinical setting for the treatment of acute uncomplicated&#xD;
      influenza, where the subjects received either 600 or 300 mg of Nitazoxanide or placebo orally&#xD;
      twice daily for five days and were followed for 28 days. Subjects who received Nitazoxanide&#xD;
      600 mg twice daily experienced shorter times to alleviation of symptoms compared with&#xD;
      subjects who received 300 mg Nitazoxanide twice daily, which in turn, was shorter than&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, there is lack&#xD;
      of effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Nearly all patients who suffered from&#xD;
      COVID-19-associated pneumonia accepted oxygen therapy and WHO recommended extracorporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to patients with refractory hypoxemia. Rescue treatment with&#xD;
      convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G are delivered to some critical cases according to&#xD;
      their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the use of Hydoxychloroquine and Nitazoxanide combination for treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infected patients is based on the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of the&#xD;
      selected drugs. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value&#xD;
      in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its morphology through&#xD;
      electron microscopy. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID-19 is nucleic acid&#xD;
      detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by&#xD;
      real-time PCR and further confirmation by next-generation sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most common adverse effects are mild nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild&#xD;
           diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most serious adverse effects are retinopathy and heart problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term use may cause liver toxicity Contraindications of Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart conditions, diabetes or psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drug transfers into breast milk so should be used with care by pregnant or nursing&#xD;
           women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions of Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antacids may decrease the absorption of Hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of Hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There may be a link between Hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with&#xD;
           glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digoxin; concomitant administration with Hydroxychloroquine may result in increased&#xD;
           serum digoxin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin or antidiabetic drugs; concomitant administration with Hydroxychloroquine may&#xD;
           enhance the effects of the hypoglycemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and may increase the risk of inducing&#xD;
           ventricular arrhythmias if used concurrently with other arrhythmogenic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mefloquine and other drugs that lower the convulsive threshold, when co-administered&#xD;
           with Hydroxychloroquine, there may be an increased risk of convulsions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent use of Hydroxychloroquine with antiepileptics may impair the antiepileptic&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclosporin when used concomitantly with Hydroxychloroquine, an increased plasma&#xD;
           cyclosporin level was reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of Nitazoxanide&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse effects are GIT as nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild&#xD;
      diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting. Nervous system side effects as headache, dizziness,&#xD;
      somnolence, insomnia, tremor, and hypesthesia have been reported in less than 1% of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications of Nitazoxanide&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no data on the excretion of Nitazoxanide into human milk. The manufacturer&#xD;
      recommends that caution be used when administering Nitazoxanide to nursing women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tizoxanide (the active metabolite of Nitazoxanide) is highly bound to plasma protein (&gt;&#xD;
      99.9%). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor for adverse reactions when administering&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide should be used with caution in patients with significant renal and hepatic&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic disease COVID-19 is particularly of major importance in Egypt where a heavy&#xD;
      population lives. There is an acute need for comprehensive, continuous, and cost-effective&#xD;
      health care delivery for infected people. Early detection and strategies for prevention of&#xD;
      progression of COVID-19 would make a major difference for these patients and would also be&#xD;
      economically beneficial for a resource-constrained country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug&#xD;
      combination for possible treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This drug combination may&#xD;
      help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through&#xD;
      different goals as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on&#xD;
           its possible activity against COVID-19 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Providing cost-effective and easy-to-implement treatment strategy for infected patients&#xD;
           and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, this clinical strategy remains an important goal in improving the Egyptian&#xD;
           health state which can save people life and save a lot of money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of Work&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of work will be conducted through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of new drug combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Nitazoxanide for treatment of&#xD;
           COVID-19 infected people. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it&#xD;
           would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in&#xD;
           the pathophysiology of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the effect of new drug combination on the symptomatic treatment of newly&#xD;
           diagnosed COVID-19 patients through a clinical trial designed according to WHO (clinical&#xD;
           management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is&#xD;
           suspected) interim guidance published at 13 March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigating the impact of new drug combination on the prevention of severe&#xD;
           compilations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
