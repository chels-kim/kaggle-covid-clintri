      This is a phase II study to test adenosine efficacy for down-regulation of the overwhelming&#xD;
      inflammation of COVID-19 in the lungs as reflected by clinical recovery of lung function;&#xD;
      resolution of clinically relevant markers of lung function, and resolution of systemic&#xD;
      markers of inflammation and coagulation.&#xD;
