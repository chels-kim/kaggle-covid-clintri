      Multicenter retrospective and prospective observational study based on the collection -&#xD;
      through pre-piloted electronic CRFs - of sequential anonymized data from principal Italian&#xD;
      ITP centers representative of national geographical distribution, to evaluate, during a&#xD;
      2-years study period, both the cumulative incidence COVID-19 occurring in patients with prior&#xD;
      or ongoing ITP (COVID-19 in ITP) and the cumulative incidence of de novo ITP manifesting&#xD;
      during COVID-19 (ITP in COVID-19). Data will be collected to describe the clinical course of&#xD;
      patients in the two groups. The enrolment period will last 24 months or terminate at the last&#xD;
      day of 1-month-COVID-19 free in Italy, whichever comes first. Each patient will be followed&#xD;
      up to the first visit scheduled as per common center practice, including at least six months&#xD;
      after hospital discharge or end of quarantine home confinement.&#xD;
