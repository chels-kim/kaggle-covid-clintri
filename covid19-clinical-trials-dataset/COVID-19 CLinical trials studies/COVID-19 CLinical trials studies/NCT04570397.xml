      Ultomiris (Ravulizumab), is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets terminal&#xD;
      complement products and is proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 induced microvasculature&#xD;
      injury and endothelial damage leading to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) causing acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI). Ravulizumab is to be used for participants with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      COVID-19 who clinically or diagnostically present with deteriorating renal function.&#xD;
      Ravulizumab causes immediate and sustained inhibition of the terminal complement cascade. The&#xD;
      use of ravulizumab could ameliorate COVID-19 induced kidney injury due to TMA, shorten&#xD;
      hospital stay, and improve the overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (COVID 19) is responsible for the current pandemic with the numbers of&#xD;
      diagnoses and fatalities rising daily. It is reported that of those requiring medical&#xD;
      intensive care almost 49% will expire prior hospital discharge. The initial peak of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients in Boston, MA occurred on April 15, 2020 however new presentations&#xD;
      continue to manifest at a local and national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact pathophysiology is still not clear. There are various theories that explain the&#xD;
      pathophysiology which includes but is not limited to direct viral damage via the&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, systemic inflammatory response with cytokine storm,&#xD;
      and aggravated hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been observed that signs and symptoms of severe COVID 19 describe&#xD;
      complement-mediated TMA rather than the sepsis induced coagulopathy. This strengthens the&#xD;
      hypothesis that complement inhibition by C5a inhibitor, Ultomiris (ravulizumab) could&#xD;
      ameliorate COVID 19 induced TMA, improve renal function, shorten the hospital stay and reduce&#xD;
      the overall mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those affected with severe or fatal COVID-19, there is evidence of end-organ damage with&#xD;
      acute kidney injury which has heightened the interest in studying the excessive cytokine&#xD;
      release and its overall effect in the form of multi-organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultomiris (Ravulizumab) is a long acting second generation monoclonal antibody against a&#xD;
      terminal complement product C5a and is FDA approved for the treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal&#xD;
      Hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.The benefit of Ultomiris has not&#xD;
      been clinically evaluated in COVID 19 induced TMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ravulizumab has been utilized in the setting of a phase 3 clinical trial for the&#xD;
      treatment of COVID 19 induced pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress. As&#xD;
      it binds to C5 and impedes the cleavage of C5 by C5 convertase to generate C5a and membrane&#xD;
      attack complex, ravulizumab could possibly improve the renal function in COVID 19 induced TMA&#xD;
      and potentially improve overall survival, due to similar pathophysiology in the&#xD;
      microvasculature of the kidney. More so, studies are being conducted to determine renal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 infection, which further enhances the interest to closely&#xD;
      examine and evaluate those patients presenting 30-60 days after COVID-19 infection with signs&#xD;
      of renal failure. There remains an unmet clinical need to investigate this approach with a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to determine if complement cascade inhibition can improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcome for COVID 19 induced acute kidney injury as measured by improvement of renal&#xD;
      function and decline in the overall morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
