  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to conduct an open-label Phase II trial to evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      safety and early efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) administration in reduction of&#xD;
      transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and development&#xD;
      of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in high-risk, healthy acute care provider&#xD;
      participants exposed, directly or indirectly, to COVID-19 patients. There is a more than 50&#xD;
      years track record of safety of HCQ for treatment and prevention of various disease states.&#xD;
      Early data on use of HCQ for COVID treatment suggests anti-viral activity and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties for reducing inflammation associated with COVID-19. Given the&#xD;
      lack of data regarding use of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention in healthy participants in midst of&#xD;
      pandemic crisis, this study proposes an expedited feasibility study focusing on safety and&#xD;
      early efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to HCQ administration, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and other baseline biomarker testing will be&#xD;
      conducted. During the 4-week study period, participants will be monitored for drug related&#xD;
      adverse events and assessed for development of COVID. SARS-CoV-2 assay and biomarker testing&#xD;
      will be repeated at the end of four-week study. Safety outcomes will be assessed by the&#xD;
      number of adverse events (AEs) and their severity; and early efficacy as the number of&#xD;
      participants who tested positive at the end of the 4-week period comparing to data collected&#xD;
      by occupational Health regarding the total number of high-risk healthcare workers that were&#xD;
      tested positive during the same period and historical controls from known high risk infection&#xD;
      rates. An exploratory analysis of inflammatory regulation and immunomodulatory markers by HCQ&#xD;
      and its effect on possible disease modification based on previously studied&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broader aim of this study is to set a precedent to facilitate a large-scale emergent&#xD;
      public health intervention. Purpose would be to mitigate, or abort further transmission of&#xD;
      COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 transmission has occurred prior to initiation of this study,&#xD;
      the rationale for this intervention is based on prior epidemiological evidence.&#xD;
      Post-infectious or vaccination-induced immunity in at least 30% of population at-risk has&#xD;
      been shown to mitigate or abort propagation of a local epidemics and global pandemic. This&#xD;
      would help flatten the curve of the disease progression, until such time that a vaccine may&#xD;
      become available. Data from this study will be used to design and implement a&#xD;
      population-based phase IIb/III randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
