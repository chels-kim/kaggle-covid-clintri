  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled, superiority, open label trial. The objective&#xD;
      of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19&#xD;
      who have mild to moderate disease or at risk for complications. We aim to demonstrate&#xD;
      decrease in progression to severe pneumonia and hospital related complications among patients&#xD;
      who are treated with HCQ compared to patients who are not.&#xD;

           patients with fever &gt;37.9ºC or cough or dyspnea or chest pain, not fulfilling severity&#xD;
           exclusion criteria. We will include patients regardless of time since symptom onset. In&#xD;
           addition, we will include asymptomatic patients with comorbidities including cardiac,&#xD;
           pulmonary, diabetes, chronic renal failure or liver disease (definitions in Appendix 1)&#xD;
           hospitalized for observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent from patient or legal representative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe infection, defined as need for invasive or non-invasive ventilator support, ECMO&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Participating in another RCT for treatment of COVID-19 Patients who meet eligibility&#xD;
           criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ration. Randomization will be done using a&#xD;
           computer-generated list of random numbers allocated centrally through a web site,&#xD;
           stratified by hospital. The random sequence will include random permuted blocks of 4 The&#xD;
           intervention group will receive oral hydroxychloroquine. In the first day 400 mg twice&#xD;
           daily, followed by 200mg twice daily on days 2-10 (continued after discharge if&#xD;
           discharged before day 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive hydroxychloroquine. Physicians will be allowed to provide&#xD;
      other medications at their discretion. For patients in the control group who develop severe&#xD;
      disease (as defined), the physician will be allowed to use HCQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discontinuing study drug include development of any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse event related to the drug (QT prolongation, anaphylaxis reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant request Primary outcome: Number of patients developing severe infection (as&#xD;
           defined above at the section of exclusion criteria) or death within 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients with severe disease as defined above&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All-cause mortality within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to symptom resolution defined as days until normalization of fever (37.9ºC),&#xD;
           respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and alleviation of cough, sustained for at&#xD;
           least 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration (days) of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical status at day 5 as assessed by National Early Warning Score 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virological failure, defined as positive PCR from respiratory or other body sample at&#xD;
           day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of acute myocarditis defined as symptoms of heart failure, chest pain or&#xD;
           arrhythmia, in the presence of elevated serum Troponin or reduced ejection fraction by&#xD;
           echocardiography, and no evidence of acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibacterial consumption, measured as days of therapy (DOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of adverse events - prolonged QT, arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting (severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge to LTCF, rehabilitation (for patients admitted from home) The trial will test&#xD;
           for chloroquine's superiority (1-sided alpha) assuming a primary outcome incidence of&#xD;
           10% in the control group and a reduction of 30% in the intervention group. With a&#xD;
           1-sided 5% alpha a fixed sample of 558 patients per group will provide 80% power to&#xD;
           reject the null hypothesis of no difference between study groups (PS power and sample&#xD;
           size). However, the trial will use an adaptive approach to determine the final sample&#xD;
           size. Interim analyses for the primary outcome will be conducted by statisticians with&#xD;
           expertise in adaptive design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be follow-up daily in-hospital. Vital and respiratory signs and symptoms will&#xD;
      be captured daily. Electrocardiogram will be performed on day 3 for all patients, with&#xD;
      follow-up as required. Adverse effects will be monitored daily and documented, including&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash or other skin manifestations. If antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      will be needed, we will refrain from using azithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine levels, CPK and&#xD;
      liver enzymes (including LDH) will be obtained at recruitment if unavailable from the last 24&#xD;
      hours. Blood count, electrolytes and creatinine levels will be repeated on days 5+/-2. Other&#xD;
      tests will be performed as clinically indicated. Chest x-ray or other chest imaging will be&#xD;
      performed at recruitment if not performed previously and repeated as necessary according to&#xD;
      clinical judgment. PCR from respiratory or body samples will be obtained on day 5 (or&#xD;
      discharge if prior to day 5) and otherwise as clinically indicated. Blood samples for&#xD;
      serology will be taken at recruitment and at day 14 (or at discharge if before day 14).&#xD;
      Samples will be frozen and batch analyzed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be contacted after discharge, assuming no change in status after discharge&#xD;
      (carry-forward assumption). Survival at day 30 will be ascertained using the health ministry&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered anonymously into a central case report form (CRF) designed in&#xD;
      RedCap. We will document the follow-up, patients' medical treatment, including antiviral,&#xD;
      antimicrobial and supportive care and all adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial follow-up and monitoring will be performed by The Rambam-Technion ID research using a&#xD;
      risk-based monitoring approach with adaptive on-site monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial flow and recruitment follow-up: Recruitment reports will be collected monthly,&#xD;
      detailing the number of eligible patients, excluded patients, reason for exclusion and number&#xD;
      of included patients, in a structured table. The recruitment status vs. expected recruitment&#xD;
      rate will be reported monthly, overall and per site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote monitoring will be performed continuously throughout the trial to check for data&#xD;
      completion and quality. Critical variables will be defined, based on data needed for baseline&#xD;
      description of the study cohort, information regarding the intervention and outcome data.&#xD;
      Feedback will be provided to local study coordinators via email or telephone. Data will be&#xD;
      completed or corrected in real time with the support of the monitoring center. Risk&#xD;
      thresholds will be defined for onsite monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onsite monitoring will be performed periodically and as required following the remote&#xD;
      monitoring thresholds. The regular onsite monitoring visits will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inspection of the informed consent forms with dates corresponding to recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria confirmed vs. patients' charts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of primary outcome data in source documents The trial will be followed by&#xD;
           an independent data and safety monitoring board and a steering committee. No interim&#xD;
           analyses are planned. All serious adverse events will be reported to the independent&#xD;
           monitoring board. Interim analyses and serious adverse events will be reported to the&#xD;
           local ethics committees, as per local good practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will include all randomized patients by intention to treat. A&#xD;
      per-protocol analysis will include patients who received the allocated intervention for at&#xD;
      least 5 calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' baseline characteristics will be reported as mean with standard deviation, or&#xD;
      median with interquartile based on variable distributions. The relative risk for the primary&#xD;
      outcome will be computed with 95% confidence intervals. Time dependent variables will be&#xD;
      analyzed using Kaplan Meyer curves. The trial will not be powered for subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be approved by the local ethics committees in participating hospitals.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be required for participation from the patients or their legal&#xD;
      guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to severe isolation precautions, a modification to the informed consent process is&#xD;
      required. The investigators will present the study drug and related information to the&#xD;
      subjects through a phone call. Subjects who agree to participate will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form which will be documented via a video chat. The informed consent process and form&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the IRB in order to ensure that the informed consent process is&#xD;
      understandable.&#xD;
