      COVID-19 Viral Global Pandemic resulting in post-infection pulmonary damage, including&#xD;
      Fibrotic Lung Disease due to inflammatory and reactive protein secretions damaging pulmonary&#xD;
      alveolar structure and functionality. A short review includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early December, 2019 - A pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China, and&#xD;
           was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  January 30th, 2020 - The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of&#xD;
           International Concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  February 7th, 2020 - 34-year-old Ophthalmologist who first identified a SARS-like&#xD;
           coronavirus) dies from the same virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  February 11th, 2020 - WHO announces a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  February 19th, 2020 - The U.S. has its first outbreak in a Seattle nursing home which&#xD;
           were complicated with loss of lives..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  March 11th, 2020 - WHO declares the virus a pandemic and in less than three months, from&#xD;
           the time when this virus was first detected, the virus has spread across the entire&#xD;
           planet with cases identified in every country including Greenland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  March 21st, 2020 - Emerging Infectious Disease estimates the risk for death in Wuhan&#xD;
           reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and ≈1% in other, more&#xD;
           mildly affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a&#xD;
           breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health&#xD;
           interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be&#xD;
           implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.&quot; March 21st 2020 -Much of the&#xD;
           United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing&#xD;
           abilities ramp up..&#xD;
&#xD;
      March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New&#xD;
      York-New Jersey, Washington, and California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical&#xD;
      trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the&#xD;
      viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary&#xD;
      function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage&#xD;
      and inflammatory changes that accompanied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cellular stromal vascular&#xD;
      fraction (cSVF) deployed intravenously to examine the anti-inflammatory and structural&#xD;
      potential to improve the residual, permanent damaged alveolar tissues of the lungs.&#xD;

           planet with cases identified in every country including Greenland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  March 11th, 2020 - As of this date, Over 60% of all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. can be&#xD;
           traced to that single nursing home in Seattle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  March 11th, 2020 - Dr. Fauci from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) states, &quot;If&#xD;
           you count all the estimated cases of people who may have it but haven't been diagnosed&#xD;
           yet, the mortality rate is probably closer to 1%,&quot; he said, &quot;which means it's 10 times&#xD;
           more lethal than the seasonal flu.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  March 21st, 2020 - The U.S. has 24,105 active cases, 301 deaths, and 171 patients&#xD;
           declared recovered, a number which has since massively increased within the United&#xD;
           States and Globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  March 21st, 2020 - Emerging Infectious Disease estimates the risk for death in Wuhan&#xD;

           United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing&#xD;
           abilities ramp up..&#xD;
&#xD;
      March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New&#xD;
      York-New Jersey, Washington, and California&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical&#xD;
      trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the&#xD;
      viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary&#xD;
      function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage&#xD;
      and inflammatory changes that accompanied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to&#xD;
      examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders,&#xD;
      showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study,&#xD;
      driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage&#xD;
      within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and&#xD;
      scarring reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization&#xD;
      potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature&#xD;
      and in scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that&#xD;
      survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative&#xD;
      new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as &quot;Functional Respiratory&#xD;
      Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung&#xD;
      tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month&#xD;
      intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency&#xD;
      at those intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in&#xD;
      time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created&#xD;
      by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that&#xD;
      is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with&#xD;
      the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
