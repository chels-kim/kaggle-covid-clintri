  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with a cytokine storm that leads to respiratory distress, multiorgan&#xD;
      failure and elevated mortality. Oral Colchicine exhibits high anti-inflammatory capacity&#xD;
      attributed to the inhibition of microtubules polymerization, inflammasome and production of&#xD;
      IL-1Î² and IL-6, which could prevent the inflammatory storm in COVID-19 patients at risk. The&#xD;
      investigators present a randomized, controlled, open-labeled, and pragmatic clinical trial to&#xD;
      study the treatment effect of Colchicine in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization, but&#xD;
      no intensive care yet. Colchicine will be started within the first 48 hours and continue for&#xD;
      14 days using a descending dose. The benefits will be studied in terms of clinical evolution&#xD;
      (WHO 7-point scale) and IL-6 levels, as well as other clinical and biochemical secondary&#xD;
      end-points. In the case of positive results, the clinical impact would be relevant given that&#xD;
      this oral medication is affordable and widely accessible which would help to prevent the&#xD;
      inflammatory complications associated with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, prospective, pragmatic, randomized, controlled and open-label trial,&#xD;
      comparing standard of care vs. standard of care plus COLCHICINE for 14 days, in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized due to COVID-19 and confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2, within the first 48 hours&#xD;
      after the hospital admission. Patients meeting severity criteria will be excluded, defined as&#xD;
      established limitation of therapeutic effort or need for invasive mechanical ventilation at&#xD;
      the time of inclusion. The Colchicine treatment includes an initial dose of 1.5 mg (1 mg and&#xD;
      0.5 mg two hours after), followed by 0.5 mg every 12 hours during the next 7 days and 0.5 mg&#xD;
      every 24 hours until the completion of 14 days of total treatment. In patients receiving&#xD;
      ritonavir or lopinavir or with reduced renal clearance (&lt;50 ml/min/1.37m2), weight &lt;70 kg or&#xD;
      age &gt;75 years old, the dose will be adjusted to the half.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patiens meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion ones (see below), after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent, will be centrally randomized to &quot;Colchicine&quot; or &quot;Control&quot;&#xD;
      group. Patients in both groups will receive the standard therapy for COVID-19 as per the&#xD;
      hospital protocols. Randomization will be controlled by: age, sex, time from initiation of&#xD;
      symptoms, cardiovascular disease, the 7 point WHO and levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin,&#xD;
      D-dimer, IL-6 and lymphocyte levels.&#xD;
