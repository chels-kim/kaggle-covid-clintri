  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal for this study is to assess whether receiving the results of an antibody&#xD;
      test changes protective behavior to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., mask-wearing, physical&#xD;
      distancing, limiting close contacts/avoiding crowds, hand-washing, avoiding contact with&#xD;
      high-risk individuals). While studies have been published on the cross-sectional relationship&#xD;
      between risk perception and other demographic characteristics and health behaviors that are&#xD;
      protective for SARS-CoV-2 infection (see citations), there have been no studies showing the&#xD;
      effect of receiving information about antibody positivity on protective behavior. Not only&#xD;
      can results from this study be used to better model transmission, a better understanding of&#xD;
      college student's risk perception around SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for future&#xD;
      vaccination strategies as well. There are concerns that a desire to return to &quot;normal&quot; life&#xD;
      in combination with reduced perception of risk could have negative consequences for uptake of&#xD;
      vaccination (Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security 2020 report, The Public's Role in&#xD;
      COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social,&#xD;
      Behavioral, and Communication Sciences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody test used in this study is named 'SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit (Colloidal&#xD;
      Gold)'. It provides a fast, on-site, and accurate detection of IgM/IgG antibodies against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, with positive results of IgM antibodies indicating a recent infection, while&#xD;
      positive results of IgG antibodies signaling a longer or previous infection. It can detect&#xD;
      IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human specimens of serum, plasma, or venous&#xD;
      whole blood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will take place between September - November, 2020, and will ask participants to&#xD;
      participate in: a web-based baseline survey, two rounds of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing&#xD;
      (September and November), and bi-weekly web-based behavioral surveys (4 total surveys). Each&#xD;
      is described in more detail below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based baseline survey: The baseline survey is designed to collect data on participant&#xD;
      demographics, SARS-CoV-2 protective behaviors, alcohol drinking habits, nicotine use, and&#xD;
      personality profile and should take less than 30 minutes to fill out. Participants who&#xD;
      provide informed consent will be provided the link to the survey which they can fill out at a&#xD;
      time convenient to them prior to first round of serological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 serological testing: There will be two rounds of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing,&#xD;
      once at baseline (September 14-23) and once at endline (November 9-11). The serological&#xD;
      testing visits will involve in-person laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The&#xD;
      laboratory test involves a fingerstick to provide a small blood sample for the antibody test&#xD;
      kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody test results will eventually be provided to all study participants via secure link&#xD;
      sent by email. With this message, we will include a clearly written information sheet about&#xD;
      the chance for inaccurate test results and how it is still unknown whether previous&#xD;
      infections confer immunity to future infections. We will clearly counsel participants to not&#xD;
      use the results of the tests as proof of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor as a reason to&#xD;
      change their behaviors. If participants wish to participate in the study, but do not wish to&#xD;
      be provided with their antibody test results, they will be able to opt out of the results&#xD;
      provision. If any participants opt out of receiving their test results, these participants&#xD;
      would essentially create a third category of respondents: those who do not receive their&#xD;
      results at all. However, these participants will still be analyzed with the trial arm to&#xD;
      which they were randomized (intent to treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary experiment will assess whether provision of the antibody test results leads to&#xD;
      behavior change with respect to personal protective behaviors. To that end, all participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to a trial arm that immediately receive results (within 24 hours) or a&#xD;
      trial arm with a delayed provision of results (after 4 weeks). So as to not incentivize early&#xD;
      drop-out, if a participant in the delayed results arm drops out early, they will still be&#xD;
      provided their test results at the regularly scheduled time, not earlier. All other&#xD;
      procedures between arms are identical. The endline laboratory test results will be delivered&#xD;
      to all participants in the same timeframe - within 24-72 hours. The early and delayed test&#xD;
      result intervention will have completed after the first round of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based behavioral surveys: To assess whether or not the provision of antibody test results&#xD;
      changes behaviors, participants will self-reported behaviors in a short web-based survey&#xD;
      every two weeks under observation. Links to these surveys will be sent to participants at&#xD;
      regular bi-weekly intervals. Participants will fill out these short follow-up surveys on&#xD;
      their computers or mobile devices. They are designed to take about 5 minutes or less to&#xD;
      complete for each survey.&#xD;
