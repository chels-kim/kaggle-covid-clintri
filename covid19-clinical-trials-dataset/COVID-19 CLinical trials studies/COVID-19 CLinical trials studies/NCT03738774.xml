  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the relationship between early unmet needs after hospital discharge&#xD;
      and subsequent clinical outcomes among survivors of acute respiratory failure. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that early unmet needs are associated with poor outcomes at three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the accumulation of data documenting the reality of extensive functional impairments&#xD;
      following ICU stay, the specific treatment needs of individuals experiencing Post-Intensive&#xD;
      Care Syndrome (PICS) are not well known largely because of a relative lack of knowledge about&#xD;
      the specific unmet needs of patients at risk for PICS at the time of hospital discharge.&#xD;
      These possible needs include oxygen prescriptions, equipment for noninvasive ventilation,&#xD;
      durable medical equipment prescriptions, coordination with government assistance and&#xD;
      community health programs, physical or occupational therapy in the home or at an outpatient&#xD;
      clinic, medications restarted or discontinued as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol individuals who were diagnosed with acute respiratory failure during an&#xD;
      ICU admission and were discharged from the ICU alive. Once enrolled, participants' medical&#xD;
      records will be reviewed for demographic and medical information. Questionnaires will be used&#xD;
      to assess the participant's status prior to ICU admittance, including comorbidities,&#xD;
      medications, physical functioning, quality of life, alcohol/smoking/substance use, social&#xD;
      support and healthcare utilization. While in the ICU, participants will receive usual&#xD;
      clinical care in this observational study. Data on mechanical ventilation, arterial blood gas&#xD;
      values, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis, delirium, and medical status&#xD;
      will be collected. Information regarding the patients' postdischarge needs including medical&#xD;
      equipment, medication, home care services, dialysis, appointments, counselling and referral&#xD;
      will also be collected by reviewing the discharge note. Follow-up evaluations by phone call&#xD;
      will occur at 1-4 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the ICU discharge. At 1-4 weeks, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate, via phone call whether the patient's post-discharge needs are&#xD;
      met. At 3 months and 6 months phone calls, standardized surveys will be used to assess&#xD;
      mortality status, readmission, healthcare utilization, functional outcomes, quality of life,&#xD;
      mental health status, coping and social support and return to work.&#xD;
