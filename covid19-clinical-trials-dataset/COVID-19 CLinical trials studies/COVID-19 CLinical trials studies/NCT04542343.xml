  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American adults, specifically those managing chronic disease and social isolation,&#xD;
      are one of the most vulnerable groups susceptible to COVID-19. This intervention involves a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary and culturally sensitive approach to address two major COVID-19 related&#xD;
      challenges in this population. First, this program collaborates with predominantly African&#xD;
      American churches to implement Federal and State guidelines aimed at preventing outbreaks of&#xD;
      COVID-19 at faith-based gatherings. Second, this program trains church-based health advisors&#xD;
      to help African American older parishioners manage their chronic health conditions and reduce&#xD;
      psychological distress during the pandemic.&#xD;

      To jointly implement and evaluate a telehealth-based, multidisciplinary, culturally-sensitive&#xD;
      intervention with 265 AA older parishioners: (i) To mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19&#xD;
      on the management of chronic health conditions, and (ii) to reduce healthcare avoidance&#xD;
      behaviors and psychological distress.&#xD;
