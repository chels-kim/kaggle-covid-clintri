  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify symptom-level intervention targets for depression related&#xD;
      to the COVID-19 outbreak. First, we will assess centrality indices of the network of&#xD;
      depression symptoms plus mechanism variables derived from the metacognitive model of&#xD;
      psychopathology measured at a period of strict social distancing protocols (T1). Then, we&#xD;
      will examine whether change in the most central symptom and metacognitive variables are more&#xD;
      related to overall symptom reduction from the period of strict (T1) to a period of lifted&#xD;
      social distancing protocols (T2) three months later. On the basis of the results,&#xD;
      interventions can be suggested that protect the general public against increased&#xD;
      psychological suffering and dysfunction during society's handling of pandemics.&#xD;

      Hypotheses (Hs) H1: In the cross-sectional depression-metacognitive network at T1, the&#xD;
      symptoms depressed mood, little interest/pleasure, and self-blame and the metacognitive&#xD;
      coping variables rumination/worry, threat monitoring, situational avoidance, thought&#xD;
      suppression, and uncontrollability of thoughts will be the most central variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Reductions of the most central variables of the cross-sectional network from T1 to T2&#xD;
      will be more related to overall reduction of symptoms in the same time frame than reductions&#xD;
      of the less central variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and participants The design is a longitudinal observational survey of the&#xD;
      general adult Norwegian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible participants are&#xD;
      all individuals of 18 years and above, who are living in Norway and thus experience identical&#xD;
      distancing protocols, and who provide informed consent to participate in the study. For this&#xD;
      study, only participants reaching the cut-off value (&gt;= 5; Kroenke et al, 2001) for&#xD;
      subclinical symptoms on the PHQ-9 at T1 will be included, amounting to 6 508 individuals. The&#xD;
      strict social distancing protocols were implemented in Norway at March 12. 2020 and the first&#xD;
      data collection in this period (T1) has already been done. It lasted seven days and was&#xD;
      between March 31st 2020 and April 7th 2020. Thus, the strict protocols had been held constant&#xD;
      during the two weeks prior to data collection, as well as during the data collection week.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no new information was given by the government during this period with regard to&#xD;
      changes of distancing protocols, keeping expectation effects constant. From June 15., the&#xD;
      majority of the distancing protocols will be lifted in Norway, and the T2 period is defined&#xD;
      from this date. Data are set to be collected from the sample providing data in the first&#xD;
      collection (N = 10 084), starting one week after the lifting of the protocols, that is, from&#xD;
      22th of June. The collection will last until enough data has been collected, but no longer&#xD;
      than three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval of the study was granted by The Regional Committee for Medical and Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics and the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (reference numbers: 125510 and&#xD;
      802810, respectively, for the first data collection, and , respectively for the second data&#xD;
      collection), where the study protocol and analysis plan was approved prior to data&#xD;
      collection. The study is conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Strengthening the&#xD;
      Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement (STROBE; Von Elm et al., 2007).&#xD;
      The pre-registered protocol for a study of loneliness based on the first (T1) data collection&#xD;
      can be found at Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04365881). The study is part of The&#xD;
      Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence Project (Ebrahimi, Hoffart, &amp; Johnson, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures The survey is disseminated online. At T1, it was disseminated in a systematic&#xD;
      manner to give the adult population an equal opportunity to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      dissemination procedure involved information about the survey through broadcasting on&#xD;
      national, regional, and local news channels and provision of the online survey to a random&#xD;
      selection of Norwegian adults on Facebook. The dissemination procedure is described in detail&#xD;
      elsewhere (Ebrahimi et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stopping rule for the first data collection was designed to ensure that the SDPs were&#xD;
      held constant for two weeks prior to and the week during the data collection period, as well&#xD;
      as controlling for expectation effects by stopping data collection instantly once information&#xD;
      concerning forthcoming modification of the social distancing protocols were given. The second&#xD;
      data collection - approaching the 10 084 individuals of the first collection - will start one&#xD;
      week after the strict protocols are lifted (June 22.) and last three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power The sample providing data at T1 comprised 10 084 participants,&#xD;
      ascertaining power for the questions asked. All these participants will be invited to partake&#xD;
      in the second data collection during the lifted prptocols period (T2) in accordance with the&#xD;
      study plan. The mentioned 'Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence Project' involves&#xD;
      multiple studies, where some involve a Complex Systems (Network analysis) approach. These&#xD;
      mutlivariate analyses require large samples and power analysis was conducted accordingly.&#xD;
      Following power analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer (2017), it is recommended that the&#xD;
      number of participants be at the very least three times larger than the number of estimated&#xD;
      parameters. However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975) for multivariate&#xD;
      research, recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of estimated&#xD;
      parameters. For our network of 9 PHQ-9 variables and 16 CAS-1 variables, the number of edges&#xD;
      in the network is 25*24/2 = 300. Thus, according to the conservative advice of Roscoe, the&#xD;
      required sample size is 3 000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding No blinding is involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there any additional blinding in this study? Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization No randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing Data Registration prior to the analysis of the T1 data and prior to the collection&#xD;
      of the T2 data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation of existing data The pandemics (and the consequent social distancing protocols)&#xD;
      occurred, by its very nature, unexpectedly and the project could not be planned in advance.&#xD;
      Thus, the first data collection started immediately and before pre-registration. It started&#xD;
      during the time-period with the strictest protocols in Norway, and the first data collection&#xD;
      was stopped before these protocols were modified or new information about them were added. We&#xD;
      have avoided any network analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipulated variables Not applicable/NA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis To test H1, the network of the 9 PHQ items and the 16 CAS-1 items will&#xD;
      be estimated using the R package qgraph (Epskamp et al., 2012) in a random half of the&#xD;
      sample. Network stability tests will be conducted using R package bootnet (Epskamp, et al.,&#xD;
      2018). An undirected partial correlation network will be estimated, resulting in associations&#xD;
      between each pair of symptoms controlling for all other associations among symptoms.&#xD;
      Centrality indices - strength and betweenness - will be computed according to the method of&#xD;
      Robinaugh et al. (2016). Strength refers to how strongly a node relates to other nodes.&#xD;
      Betweenness refers to how important a node is in paths between other nodes. Hypothesis 2 will&#xD;
      be tested in the other random half of the sample. The outcomes of interest will be the degree&#xD;
      to which change in a variable from T1 to T2 correlates with the change in the PHQ-9 total&#xD;
      score (minus the variable examined if it is a symptom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data There are no missing data in the first data collection because the survey&#xD;
      includes only mandatory responses. Dropout from the second data collection is to be expected,&#xD;
      but the amount of missing data is uncertain. The multiple imputation procedure in SPSS will&#xD;
      be used to impute missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis We may do other exploratory analysis that we have not yet thought of at&#xD;
      the time of preregistration. If we do such exploratory analyses, we will explicitly state&#xD;
      them as exploratory in the published manuscript following common publishing guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other The data include one directly identifiable variable (contact information) for&#xD;
      participants in accordance to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law in EU, which&#xD;
      is to give the participants the opportunity to have their data deleted upon request. Data are&#xD;
      thus kept on a safe server belonging to the University of Oslo and will be accessed first&#xD;
      following de-identification.&#xD;
