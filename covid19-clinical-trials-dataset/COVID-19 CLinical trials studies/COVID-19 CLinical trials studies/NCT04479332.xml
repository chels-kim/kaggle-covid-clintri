  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the ER of National Taiwan University Hospital, the critical patients are treated&#xD;
      (including tracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in either resuscitation&#xD;
      area or negative pressure isolation rooms based on the past history and present illness.&#xD;
      During COVID-19 epidemic, whether sequential changes in environmental and personal protective&#xD;
      equipment would change the difference of treatment efficacy and patient safety remains&#xD;
      unclear. Whether treating patients in resuscitation area or negative pressure isolation room&#xD;
      would cause different physical and psychological stress of medical staff and environmental&#xD;
      contamination is also unknown. This study aims to conduct a prospective sequential allocation&#xD;
      clinical trial to investigate the success rate, patient safety, physical and psychological&#xD;
      stress of medical staff, and the risk of environmental contamination of tracheal intubation&#xD;
      and cardiopulmonary resuscitation between the resuscitation area and negative pressure&#xD;
      isolation room. The results of the study may be used to improve the protocol and protective&#xD;
      policy in treating critical patients during an epidemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The critical care of patients with an emergency has always been the clinical challenge to the&#xD;
      medical staff in the emergency room (ER). The emergency includes sudden cardiac arrest,&#xD;
      respiratory failure, acute conscious change, cardiovascular emergency, sepsis, etc. How to&#xD;
      treat these patients appropriately and immediately is an important issue, which may change&#xD;
      the disease process and prognosis, and save the life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to the epidemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), several changes in the&#xD;
      environmental and personal protective equipment have been made in the ER when treating&#xD;
      critical patients. The doctor and nurses need to wear individual protective equipment&#xD;
      including Level C protective clothing, goggles, N95 mask, surgical mask, guard panel, hair&#xD;
      cap, and double-layered gloves to prevent infectious droplet during tracheal intubation.&#xD;
      However, the protective equipment may limit the movement and obstruct the vision and thus&#xD;
      result in response delays, difficult intubation, and prolong hand-off period during&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. On the other hand, wearing N95 mask, surgical mask and guard&#xD;
      panel may impair the communication. Additionally, the medical staff may not have enough time&#xD;
      to wear the protective equipment during emergency events, and therefore suffer from a higher&#xD;
      risk of infection, which may consequently cause a certain level of psychological stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to conduct a prospective sequential allocation clinical trial to investigate&#xD;
      the success rate, patient safety, physical and psychological stress of medical staff, and the&#xD;
      risk of environmental contamination of tracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#xD;
      between the resuscitation area and negative pressure isolation room. The results of the study&#xD;
      may be used to improve the protocol and protective policy in treating critical patients&#xD;
      during an epidemic.&#xD;
