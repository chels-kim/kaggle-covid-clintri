    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the impact of inhaled remdesivir (RDV)&#xD;
      on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in participants&#xD;
      with early stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

      This study will have multiple parts: Part A, Part B, and Part C. Part B will be conducted if&#xD;
      supported by evaluation in healthy volunteers in another Phase 1a Gilead study&#xD;
      (GS-US-553-9018). Participants in Part C will be enrolled after review of preliminary safety&#xD;
      and available efficacy data from Parts A and B through at least Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GS-US-553-9018 is a Phase 1a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, single- and&#xD;
      multiple-dose study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of remdesivir administered by inhalation.&#xD;

    <description>The InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO©) is a 32-item patient-reported outcome questionnaire that assesses severity of symptoms of influenza and influenza-like illness across six body systems. An additional two items can be added to assess changes in taste or smell, if the instrument is used to quantify symptoms in studies of COVID-19. Each domain scores range from 0 (symptom free) to 4 (very severe symptoms). Higher scores on this scale represent higher disease severity. Alleviation is defined as symptom scores as 2 or higher at baseline are scored as 0 (absent) or 1 (mild) at postbaseline, and symptoms scored as 1 at baseline are scored as 0 at postbaseline, and for two consecutive days.</description>
