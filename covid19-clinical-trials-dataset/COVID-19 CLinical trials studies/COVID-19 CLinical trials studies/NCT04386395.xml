    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak causes a spectrum of clinical patterns that varies from asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection to mildly symptomatic manifestations and more-severe forms that need intensive&#xD;
      care. Until now, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been poorly reported&#xD;
      to help decision for immune modulation therapies. As a consequence, trials have been designed&#xD;
      to test both anti-inflammatory molecules as steroids or anti-bodies against IL-6, and others&#xD;
      proposing to &quot;boost&quot; immunity with interferon beta based on similar inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune response to infective agents including viruses may have a complex time evolution&#xD;
      with early and late phases corresponding to different patterns, oscillating between&#xD;
      pro-inflammation and immune-depression. The potential window to improve outcome in COVID-19&#xD;
      by therapeutic intervention aimed at a fine tuning between immune toxicity and&#xD;
      immunodepression requires a longitudinal assessment during the course of illness, especially&#xD;
      for the patients who develop acute respiratory failure. Immune monitoring of both innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immunity would then be essential to appropriately design clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole blood cells evaluation was recorded according to the time intervals between the&#xD;
      onset of symptoms and the sampling after ICU admission. Patients' care was standardized,&#xD;
      especially with regard to ventilation, sedation, and antimicrobial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators prospectively perform a longitudinal study of both innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immunity on patients admitted to ICU for an COVID-19 related acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure. The data will be analyzed in reference to the onset of initial symptoms and also to&#xD;
      the admission in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is the evolution of the characterization of monocytes and their subsets&#xD;
      in term of number and expression of HLA-DR. A similar approach is used for lymphocytes and&#xD;
      their subtypes with in addition, an ex vivo testing of their capabilities to be stimulated by&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in term of TNFalpha, INFgamma, and IL1beta production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-point was to test the association with outcomes and other non-specific&#xD;
      markers of inflammation as CRP (C reactive protein), PCT (procalcitonin), DDimers and&#xD;
      ferritin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most severe form of COVID-19 treated in intensive care for acute respiratory failure may&#xD;
      have a poor prognosis. Both the level of IL-6 and the severity of the lymphopenia have been&#xD;
      associated to the poor prognosis. Better knowledge of the time evolution of the circulating&#xD;
      immune cells subpopulations and functions will help to best tailor the treatment:&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory strategy at the initial phase might be rapidly shifted to immune&#xD;
      stimulation when immunodepression is diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is then essential to assess the patients' immune status using flowcytometry methods to&#xD;
      characterize both innate and adaptive immunity of the whole blood circulating immune&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After cell staining with the adequate cell&#xD;
      markers, the flowcytometry (NAVIOS® Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) allowed to analyze the&#xD;
      number and the function of the cells with an adequate gating strategy and the Kaluza®&#xD;
      software v2.1 (Beckman Coulter). The data were then grouped by time intervals referring to&#xD;
      the onset of symptoms and also to the ICU admission. The trend for innate immunity (monocytes&#xD;
      number and subpopulations, HLA-DR expression) and for adaptive immunity (lymphocytes and&#xD;
      subpopulations) will be analyzed. Since it is unknown if whole blood CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8&#xD;
      lymphocytes elicit an &quot;exhaustion&quot; pattern and/or an abnormal response, an ex vivo testing of&#xD;
      their reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins will be performed. This test of&#xD;
      polyfunctionality will characterize the intracellular cytokine expression (IL-1 beta,&#xD;
      TNFalpha, and INFgamma) both for CD4 and CD8 T cells.&#xD;
