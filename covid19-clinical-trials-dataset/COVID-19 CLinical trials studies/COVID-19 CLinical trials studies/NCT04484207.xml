    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely and rapidly spread around the world,&#xD;
      overwhelming intensive care units and health care capacity. While the physical risk (e.g.&#xD;
      pneumonia, respiratory breakdown) is getting the most scientific and clinical attention, this&#xD;
      outbreak also has significant mental health risks and extreme psychological fear-related&#xD;
      responses. Among the general population, there are high-risk groups as elderly people,&#xD;
      disabled individuals and people with previous exposure to trauma (e.g., people with military&#xD;
      experience). Veterans are among the subgroups who are high risk for PTSD and other mental&#xD;
      health problem. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of an online,&#xD;
      largescale, brief video-based intervention in reducing fear and stress and improving help&#xD;
      seeking behavior in relate to COVID-19.&#xD;

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely and rapidly spread around the world,&#xD;
      overwhelming intensive care units and health care capacity, leading the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic. According to the official website of the WHO1, more&#xD;
      than 3 million people have been confirmed to have a COVID-19 infection, and over than 200,000&#xD;
      deaths have resulted from COVID-19 in almost every area or territories around the world. To&#xD;
      effectively cope with the COVID-19 outbreak, various governments have implemented rapid and&#xD;
      comprehensive public health emergency interventions that include social restrictions and&#xD;
      quarantines, which is the separation and restriction of movement of people who might have&#xD;
      been exposed to the virus. Non-essential workers were required to stay at home and the&#xD;
      shutdown of non-essential businesses are among the restrictions that influence the lives of&#xD;
      millions across the globe. While the physical risk (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory breakdown) is&#xD;
      getting the most scientific and clinical attention, this outbreak also has significant mental&#xD;
      health risks and extreme psychological fear-related responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outbreak of COVID-19 caused public panic and mental health stress. The rapidly changing&#xD;
      information on COVID-19 and the increasing number of confirmed cases and death have elicited&#xD;
      fear and anxiety about becoming infected. Isolated at home, people consume information that&#xD;
      might be unreliable and unverified for many hours every day. The widespread use of social&#xD;
      media and the extensive array (or sources) of information can increase confusion and worries&#xD;
      which in turn increases fear and anxiety. Moreover, indirect exposure to 24-hours of&#xD;
      television news and social media has a wide range of psychopathological consequences, of&#xD;
      which Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms are the most common. A recent study&#xD;
      conducted in China one month into the outbreak examined the prevalence of mental health&#xD;
      problems in COVID-19 era and found a high rate of depression (48.3%), anxiety (22.6%) and a&#xD;
      combination of depression and anxiety (19.4%) among 4,872 people. Furthermore, people with&#xD;
      increased social media exposure were almost twice as likely to have depression and anxiety&#xD;
      than people with less social media exposure. To date, more than 3 billion people are being&#xD;
      asked to stay at home, which may lead to increased exposure to social media, likely resulting&#xD;
      in widespread mental health problems among isolated individuals around the globe. Given the&#xD;
      magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak, its risk to physical and mental health,and the unique&#xD;
      nature requiring to stay isolated, sheltered, at hospitals, or at home, an effective and&#xD;
      timely response is essential to address the psychosocial needs associated with the ongoing&#xD;
      exposure to social media, disease, death, and distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the general population, there are high-risk groups as elderly people, disabled&#xD;
      individuals and people with previous exposure to trauma (e.g., people with military&#xD;
      experience). Veterans are among the subgroups who are high risk for PTSD and other mental&#xD;
      health problem. Furthermore, many veterans are reluctant to seek help, despite enduring&#xD;
      symptoms, they avoid mental health care, or may wait years to decades before they seek help.&#xD;
      Among reasons to avoid seeking help, patients report mistrust in mental health providers,&#xD;
      being seen as weak or stereotyped as &quot;dangerous/violent/crazy&quot;, and a belief that they are&#xD;
      responsible for having mental health problems. Applying strategies to reduce self-stigma and&#xD;
      improve help seeking behavior among veterans may ameliorate impaired functioning and reduce&#xD;
      risks for long-term psychiatric illness. Thornicroft showed that social contact is the most&#xD;
      effective type of intervention to improve helpseeking behavior and stigma-related attitudes.&#xD;
      Social contact involves interpersonal contact with a member of the group; While both direct,&#xD;
      in-person social contact and indirect, video-based social contact have effectively improved&#xD;
      attitudes toward mental illness, the latter can be implemented on a larger scale. Corrigan&#xD;
      and colleagues11 identified the most important ingredients of contact-based programs: an&#xD;
      empowered presenter with lived experience who attains his/her goals (e.g., &quot;I was able to&#xD;
      fight the COVID-19&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of an online, large-scale,&#xD;
      brief video-based intervention in reducing fear and stress and improving help seeking&#xD;
      behavior in relate to COVID-19.&#xD;
