  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For limiting COVID-19 spreading, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended worldwide&#xD;
      confinement on 2010. In France, unessential institutions were closed on March 14th and&#xD;
      population confinement was decided on March 17th.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quarantine and/or confinement could lead to psychological effects such as confusion, suicide&#xD;
      ideation, post-traumatic stress symptoms or anger COVID-19 outbreak highlighted a&#xD;
      considerable proportion of health care workers (HCW) with depression, insomnia, anxiety and&#xD;
      distress symptoms. In front line, facing the virus with the fear of contracting it and&#xD;
      contaminate their closest. During previous outbreaks (H1N1, SARS), HCWs have been shown to&#xD;
      experience such negative psychological effects of confinement as well as work avoidance&#xD;
      behaviour and physical interaction reduction with infected patients (4-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, Covid 19 outbeak led to increase ICU bed capacity with a full reorganization of&#xD;
      the human resources. Some caregivers were reassigned to newly setup units admitting or not&#xD;
      Covid-19 patients. In the same time, non-caregivers were also encouraged to work at home&#xD;
      whenever possible. Thus, every hospital staff member's private and professional life could be&#xD;
      altered by the Covid-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all these changes in the daily life could induce psychological disturbances, the present&#xD;
      study was aimed at assessing the acute anxiety level (main objective) of the staff in our&#xD;
      Tertiary University Hospital, (6300 employees). Secondarily, the self-reported insomnia,&#xD;
      pain, catastrophism and work avoidance behaviour levels were assessed&#xD;
