  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food insecurity (FI), limited access to food due to a lack of money or other resources,&#xD;
      affected an estimated 14% households with children in the US in 2018. Multiple national&#xD;
      organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), have identified adverse&#xD;
      childhood outcomes that are strongly correlated with FI, and the AAP recommends that&#xD;
      physicians universally screen for and address FI, but screening for FI has primarily been&#xD;
      addressed in the outpatient setting. Recent data demonstrates rising FI needs related to&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. There is limited information regarding screening and interventions for&#xD;
      inpatient FI, defined as the inability to obtain adequate food during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Previous work performed a cross-sectional study of 200 caregivers of hospitalized children in&#xD;
      Chicago, Illinois, estimated the prevalence of inpatient FI to be 32%. Locally, work by Drs.&#xD;
      Alice Lee, Lopez, and Bocchini identified hospital food insecurity (FI) in 43% of the&#xD;
      caregivers of hospitalized children (Lee, Alice, et al. &quot;Food Insecurity in the Caregivers of&#xD;
      Hospitalized Pediatric Patients.&quot; Pediatrics 2018: 481-481.) . The investigators also found a&#xD;
      strong association between inpatient and household food insecurity. Hospital food insecurity&#xD;
      has a profound effect on caregiver's ability to participate in caring for their children&#xD;
      during the hospitalization. Currently, there is not a valid screening tool to address&#xD;
      inpatient food insecurity and there is a paucity of data on the effects of FI interventions&#xD;
      implemented in the hospital setting. Additionally, there is new data from the COVID Impact&#xD;
      Survey and The Hamilton Project/Future of the Middle Class Initiative Survey of Mothers with&#xD;
      Young Children demonstrating that FI prevalence has more than doubled in household with&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

      Screening / Enrollment: At enrollment the research coordinator will create daily epic report&#xD;
      list, maintain notes on eligible subjects obtain informed consent, verify eligibility, have&#xD;
      caregiver complete demographics questionnaire in REDCap, and have caregiver complete food&#xD;
      insecurity survey in REDCap. Research coordinator will notify investigator of + FI screen&#xD;
      based on score of 3 or higher for household or inpatient tallied in REDCap. Research&#xD;
      coordinator to activate the Admission/Discharge/Transfers (ADT) notice in Epic and link the&#xD;
      subjects child in order to be notified when subjects child is discharged. The investigator&#xD;
      will verify the score for food insecurity positive caregivers and the investigator will order&#xD;
      the caregiver tray or notify the RC that the RC can order the caregiver tray for FI positive&#xD;
      caregivers in Epic. The RC will complete a brief study note in Epic to state the caregiver&#xD;
      was enrolled in the study. The investigator will complete the referral to Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital food bank representative. Parents will receive handouts on caregiver tray, guest&#xD;
      tray, hospital food resources, and the FIRST link program with the Houston food bank phone&#xD;
      number (found in attachments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be completed after informed consent is obtained. If a caregiver&#xD;
      declines to participate in the study or screens negative for FI, they will still have the&#xD;
      option to meet with with social work who is able to provide FI resources including caregiver&#xD;
      trays, food bank referrals, educational materials, and gift cards depending on the social&#xD;
      workers assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Research coordinator will complete the follow up survey with caregiver 2 weeks&#xD;
      after discharge. Subjects should be called daily (Mon-Friday) due to short window for follow&#xD;
      up (2 weeks after discharge + 7 days). The RC will attempt to contact the subject at least&#xD;
      three times by phone and one time by email in an attempt to complete the follow-up study&#xD;
      visit and will notify PI about the non-availability of the subject to complete it. Responses&#xD;
      will be entered into RedCAP by the RC if the survey is conducted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to objective data on whether the inpatient intervention was utilized by families the&#xD;
      investigators will request a caregiver tray report from Morrison's food vendor company for&#xD;
      the caregiver trays. The report request will include all caregiver trays ordered for West&#xD;
      Tower 15, 14, and 12 floors: -Person who placed the order -Patient room number -Number of&#xD;
      trays ordered -Time and date trays ordered -Meal ordered&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will periodically run EPIC reports to determine the number of caregiver trays&#xD;
      ordered for the study. This report will be used to reimburse social work for the cost of the&#xD;
      food trays.&#xD;
