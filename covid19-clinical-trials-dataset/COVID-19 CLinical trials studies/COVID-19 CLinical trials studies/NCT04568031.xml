  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruption to healthcare systems with significant&#xD;
      socioeconomic impacts. Currently, there are no licensed preventions available against&#xD;
      COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is urgently needed. A safe and effective vaccine&#xD;
      for COVID 19 prevention would have significant global public health impact.&#xD;
