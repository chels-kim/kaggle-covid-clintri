    <textblock>
      With the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the frontline medical workers faced&#xD;
      enormous stress, including a high risk of infection and inadequate protection from&#xD;
      contamination, isolation, patients with negative emotions, a lack of contact with their&#xD;
      families, and exhaustion, which may cause mental health problems. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      collect the faecal samples and clinical assessments from a part of frontline medical workers&#xD;
      in three time points to analyse the changing profile of gut microbiome according to outcomes&#xD;
      of 16s rRNA sequencing. The samples from the matched health controls will also be sequenced&#xD;
      to compare with the exposed group in gut microbiome community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, Hubei&#xD;
      province, China, and has subsequently spread to more than 30 provinces in China and almost&#xD;
      100 countries in the world. In the fight against the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),&#xD;
      medical workers in Wuhan have been facing enormous stress, including a high risk of infection&#xD;
      and inadequate protection from contamination, isolation, patients with negative emotions, a&#xD;
      lack of contact with their families, and exhaustion. The severe situation is causing mental&#xD;
      health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and&#xD;
      fear. These mental health problems could also cause posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in a&#xD;
      lasting time. A research examining the psychological impact of the 2003 outbreak of severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome on hospital empoyees found that about 10% of the respondents had&#xD;
      experienced high leves of PTS symptoms since the SARS outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis has been validated in expanding studies, which means there&#xD;
      are bidirectional communication between commensal organisms within the gut and the brain. Gut&#xD;
      microbiota may influence brain function through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. For&#xD;
      example, substances produced by the gut microbiota may be absorbed reaching the brain by the&#xD;
      blood stream. The brain, in turn, may influence the gut microbiota trough neuronal and&#xD;
      endocrine pathways. In recent years, many reseaches support the relevance of microbiota and&#xD;
      mental health status. Bercik et al. transplanted microbiota from adult germ-free (GF) BALB/c&#xD;
      mice (a high-anxiety mouse strain) into adult GF NIH Swiss mice (a low-anxiety mouse strain),&#xD;
      then found the behavioral profile of the donor was evident in the recipient animal, showing&#xD;
      that the microbiota can directly affect behavior. Moreover, preclinical studies have shown&#xD;
      that stress and emotions, including maternal separation and restraint, heat, and acoustic&#xD;
      stress, alters the composition of the gut microbiota, maybe through the release of stress&#xD;
      hormones or sympathetic neurotransmitters that influence gut physiology and alter the habitat&#xD;
      of the microbiota. In addition, researchers found that stress has the ability to increase&#xD;
      intestinal permeability, probably through the involvement of corticotrophin releasing factor&#xD;
      and its receptors (CRFR1 and CRFR2), which play a key role in stress-induced gut permeability&#xD;
      dysfunction. Increased intestinal permeability provides bacteria an opportunity to&#xD;
      translocate across the intestinal mucosa and directly access both the immune and neuronal&#xD;
      cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Stress also activates the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system, which affects gastric acid, bile, and mucus secretion, as well as gut motility. Gut&#xD;
      motility is of particular importance since it is strongly associated with gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition and richness. Based on these researches, the gut microbiome increasingly deserve&#xD;
      attention to understand psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study aim to collect the faecal samples and clinical assessments from&#xD;
      a part of frontline medical workers in three time points to analyse the changing profile of&#xD;
      gut microbiome according to outcomes of 16s rRNA sequencing. The samples from the matched&#xD;
      health controls will also be sequenced to compare with the exposed group in gut microbiome&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design and sample collection The frontline workers in First Affiliated Hospital&#xD;
      of Xi'an Jiaotong University will be included if they conformed with (1) taking part in the&#xD;
      medical team to support Wuhan, (2) of 18 to 50 years old, (3) did not take antibiotics within&#xD;
      3 months before sample collection, (4) 17.5&lt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;30. The healthy controls&#xD;
      will be selected from the staffs in First Affiliated Hospital who didn't join in the medical&#xD;
      team but fulfill the last three conditions above to match with the frontline staffs for age,&#xD;
      gender, BMI, and diet. Any participant will be excluded if he/she fulfill the following&#xD;
      criteria: (1) have serious cardiovascular disease, blood disease, and endocrine disease, (2)&#xD;
      have a history of cancer or its complications, (3) have active gastrointestinal diseases or&#xD;
      complications and serious systemic diseases, (4) have history of brain organic diseases or&#xD;
      complications and mental retardation, (5) have mental disorders such as mood disorder and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, (6) pregnant or lactating, (7) drink in the past week (liquor&gt;250ml or&#xD;
      beer&gt;1bottle) or the previous day (liquor&gt;50ml or beer&gt;50ml). All included persons should&#xD;
      provide signed informed consent before sample collection, and the protocol was approved by&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University&#xD;
      (KYLLSL-2020-043). Faecal samples from each staff should be freshly collected at the hospital&#xD;
      and frozen at -80â„ƒ using specified faecal collector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessmant PHQ-15, PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSQI, SCL-90, and IES-R will be used for the&#xD;
      assessment of clinical symptoms related to psychiatric disorder for exposed group in three&#xD;
      time point and non-exposed group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing The investigators will perform 16S rRNA sequencing for&#xD;
      all the collected faecal samples. Briefly, bacterial genomic DNA will be extracted, and the&#xD;
      16S rRNA whole region will be amplified by PCR, and then sequenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The 16S rRNA sequencing data will be analysed using Quantitative&#xD;
      Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME). The investigators then use usearch to cluster&#xD;
      sequences into taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% identity and construct the OTU table. Microbial&#xD;
      community structure, alpha diversity, and beta diversity will be analysed. LEfSe analysis,&#xD;
      and random forest analysis will be used to find the biomarker between different group.&#xD;
      Spearman's rank correlation will be used to identify the corrolation between clinical&#xD;
      assessments and stress-associated microbiome.&#xD;
