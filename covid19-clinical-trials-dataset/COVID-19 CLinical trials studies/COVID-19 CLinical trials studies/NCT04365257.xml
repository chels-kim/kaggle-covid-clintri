    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of prazosin to prevent&#xD;
      cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications in hospitalized patients with Coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) elicits an exuberant local or systemic immune response ('hyperinflammation') in&#xD;
      the lung and other sites of viral replication, compromising organ function and leading to&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 develops a cytokine storm syndrome that is associated with elevation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other&#xD;
      cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1&#xD;
      adrenergic receptor (⍺1-AR) signaling. The ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin prevents cytokine storm&#xD;
      and markedly increased survival following inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models. In a&#xD;
      retrospective study of outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia, patients&#xD;
      who were taking ⍺1-AR antagonists had significantly lower probability of needing invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and dying in the hospital compared to non-users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prazosin may blunt surges in catecholamines and self-amplifying cytokine production&#xD;
      (including interleukin 6) and, as an early preemptive therapy in patients prior to disease&#xD;
      progression, may prevent cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing who are hospitalized (but are not&#xD;
      requiring more than 4 liters/minute of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula) will be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility. Patients who provide informed consent and meet eligibility requirements will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either prazosin or standard of care. Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the study drug will receive prazosin for 28 days and all patients will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 60 days to capture outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Prazosin 1mg given to observe if medication is tolerated or if signs or symptoms of hypotension develop (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness).&#xD;
If the patient remains asymptomatic and BP &gt;110/60 mmHg, prazosin is continued at 1mg every 8 hours (q8h).&#xD;
Day 3: If the patient remains asymptomatic and BP &gt;110/60 mmHg, increase dose to 2mg q8h.&#xD;
Day 6: If the patient remains asymptomatic and BP &gt;110/60 mmHg, increase dose to 5mg q8h.&#xD;
If the BP is &lt;100/60 mmHg at any time, the next dose should be held, and patient continues with the highest previously tolerated dose 8 hours later.&#xD;
If the patient did not tolerate dose escalation to 5mg q8h, one attempt is made to increase dose to 3mg q8h. If this is not tolerated, the patient continues with the highest previously tolerated dose 8 hours later.&#xD;
If BP monitoring is not available, repeated occurrences of postural dizziness should trigger drug dose reduction or BP monitoring.</description>
