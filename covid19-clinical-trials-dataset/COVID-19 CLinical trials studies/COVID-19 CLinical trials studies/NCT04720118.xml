      The purpose of this research study is to examine the relationship between personal&#xD;
      characteristics and satisfaction with care in those diagnosed with Parkinson's disease during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will take 4 different surveys regarding their&#xD;
      satisfaction with care throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The surveys in total&#xD;
      should not take more than 30 minutes to complete&#xD;

    <description>Participants will take the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scale. This will determine if the participant has more of an internal or external locus of control. Participants will also take the Quality of Life Scale- U.S Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) to determine the quality of life they have been experiencing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of both surveys, the researchers will be able to determine if external locus of control or internal locus of control leads to a better quality of life in PD patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

    <measure>Measure of secondary control and satisfaction with care</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will take the Multidimensional Health Locus Control (MHLC) scale. This will determine what type of control is most present in the participant's life. Additionally, participant's will take the Short Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18). This will determine how satisfied participants are with their healthcare providers throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Based off of the responses to the surveys, the researcher will be able to determine whether a higher or lower secondary control yields a higher satisfaction.</description>
