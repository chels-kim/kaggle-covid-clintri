  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Risk stratification in COVID-19 patients in the ICU (RISC-19-ICU) registry was founded&#xD;
      during the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by infection with&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus that was first described in December 2019. The disease has spread&#xD;
      exponentially in many countries and has reached global pandemic status within three months.&#xD;
      According to first experience, hospitalization was required in approximately 20 % of cases&#xD;
      and severe, life-threatening illness resulted in approximately 10 %. In some countries,&#xD;
      health care systems were overwhelmed by the rapid increase in critically ill patients that&#xD;
      far exceeded their capacity. It is thus of utmost importance to gain knowledge about the&#xD;
      characteristics and course of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and to stratify these&#xD;
      patients according to their risk for further deterioration. A key part of fighting this&#xD;
      pandemic is to exchange scientific information and advance our understanding of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Risk stratification in COVID-19 patients in the ICU (RISC-19-ICU) registry aims to&#xD;
      collect an anonymized dataset to characterize patients that develop life-threatening critical&#xD;
      illness due to COVID-19 and make it accessible to collaborative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected may be composed of a core dataset and/or an extended dataset. The core&#xD;
      dataset consists of a basic set of parameters, of which many are commonly generated during&#xD;
      treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit (the individual&#xD;
      parameters are marked yellow in the attached case report forms, and are clearly marked on the&#xD;
      electronic case report forms during data entry). The extended dataset consists of parameters&#xD;
      that may be measured during treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in an&#xD;
      intensive care unit, depending on clinical practice, indication and availability of the&#xD;
      measurement method. The data accumulating in the registry as the pandemic or subsequent waves&#xD;
      develop are made available to the collaborators to support an optimal response to the&#xD;
      pandemic threat. The information gained on the initial characteristics and disease course via&#xD;
      the RISC-19-ICU registry may contribute to a better understanding of the risk factors for&#xD;
      developing critical illness due to COVID-19 and for an unfavorable disease course, and thus&#xD;
      support informed patient triage and management decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial research questions are (I) to perform risk stratification of critically ill patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 to find predictors associated with the development of critical illness due to&#xD;
      COVID-19: characterization of the study population, which are critically ill patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19: inflammation, oxygenation, circulatory function, among other parameters collected&#xD;
      in the registry, and (II) to perform risk stratification of critically ill patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 to predict outcome after ICU admission (ICU mortality, ICU length of stay):&#xD;
      characterization of patients grouped by disease course in the ICU, based on inflammation,&#xD;
      oxygenation, circulatory function, and other parameters collected in the registry.&#xD;
