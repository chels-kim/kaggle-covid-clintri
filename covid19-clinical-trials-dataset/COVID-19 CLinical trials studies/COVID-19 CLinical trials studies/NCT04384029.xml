  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to analyse the clinical data of all patients&#xD;
      admitted in Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) or in a care center in Geneva who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19. CVD being one of the most important risk factors for developing a severe form&#xD;
      of the disease, the investigators will explore the prognosis and clinical outcomes of those&#xD;
      patients according to their CVD history as well as newly onset CVD during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Moreover, as further evidence is needed on the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system&#xD;
      (RAAS) inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the investigators will study prognosis&#xD;
      and outcomes according to the patients' medications. Finally, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      evaluate hospital length of stay and cost. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and&#xD;
      scientific evidence from patients hospitalized and diagnosed positive for COVID-19, in order&#xD;
      to evaluate if previous (or newly onset) CVD may influence outcomes and costs.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19+ hospitalized patients with preexisting CVD or newly onset CVD at time of&#xD;
      hospitalization have different clinical outcomes compared to those without CVD and COVID-19+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to gather observational data, starting from February 1st&#xD;
      2020 until the end of the pandemic, to compare clinical outcomes COVID+ hospitalized patients&#xD;
      at HUG or in a care center in Geneva with pre-existing or newly onset CVD, to COVID+&#xD;
      hospitalized patients at HUG or in a care center in Geneva without pre-existing CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the association between COVID-19 disease and CVD, based on: age, previous&#xD;
           CV diseases, CV risks factors, CV medications (e.g. ACE Inhibitors or angiotensin II&#xD;
           receptor antagonists)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore CVD profiles that may influence COVID-19 disease outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the cause of death in CVD patients (either with preexisting CVD or newly&#xD;
           diagnosed with CVD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the vulnerability of the myocardium (new event of either heart failure,&#xD;
           acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, myocarditis) in patients with COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
