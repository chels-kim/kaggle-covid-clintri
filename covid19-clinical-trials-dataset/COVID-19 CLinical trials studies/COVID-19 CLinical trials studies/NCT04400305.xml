  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based health promotion programs have the potential to reach more individuals than in&#xD;
      person interventions, without overtaxing healthcare resources. Having a high quality,&#xD;
      user-centered web-based program can help maximize user engagement and adherence. Thus, the&#xD;
      primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility, time, cost, and&#xD;
      acceptability of a web-based physical activity behavior change program with Canadian Adults&#xD;
      who have had to start practising/following the social distancing guidelines due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 situation. We will also be examining changes other behavioral indicators related to&#xD;
      PA as a secondary outcome measure.&#xD;

      Background: Physical activity is associated with management and/or prevention of over 25&#xD;
      chronic health conditions; however the majority of adults in North America are not active&#xD;
      enough to experience these benefits. Behavioral strategies have been shown to be effective&#xD;
      for increasing physical activity, and our online platform includes components of several&#xD;
      behavioral strategies including goal setting and feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population: Participants will be Canadian adults over 18 who have&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. recently started practising social distancing due to our current COVID-19 situation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. currently are participating in physical activity below Canadian recommended guidelines&#xD;
           (150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants must have access to the Internet. Sample Size: 40 participants, 20&#xD;
           participants per group - (Control) 20 participants (intervention) Participants will be&#xD;
           excluded from the project if they do not have access to the Internet, are unable to&#xD;
           speak/read English, are not engaging in moderate-to vigorous PA (MVPA) sufficient to&#xD;
           meet the PA Guidelines, have an existing chronic medical condition potentially making&#xD;
           them at risk of injury or ill health from increasing their physical activity (assessed&#xD;
           using the GAQ. Screening will be completed formally over the phone, and participants&#xD;
           will give their consent online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition one: Waitlist control group: One group (evenly representing Adults practising&#xD;
      social distancing) will complete the baseline and final questionnaires (online). At the end&#xD;
      of the study this group will have the option to receive access to the other group's materials&#xD;
      (online platform) if they wish, for the 6 week period following the study. Access to the&#xD;
      online platform is for study participant use and benefit only and no participant data/website&#xD;
      analytics will be collected at this point in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition two: One group (evenly representing Adults practising social distancing) will&#xD;
      complete the online baseline questionnaire, and receive access to the online platform.&#xD;
      Briefly, the participants will be shown (via skype, Face time, Zoom or other alternate online&#xD;
      technology) how to use it .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 weeks, a check-in session will occur, depending on what the participant prefers, a&#xD;
      researcher will arrange a virtual visit or phone call with the participant to chat about how&#xD;
      their physical activity has been going and to ensure the web application' usability. Again at&#xD;
      this point on-going consent will be secured. At 6 weeks a researcher will arrange a virtual&#xD;
      visit or phone call with the participant &amp; ask them to complete the final online&#xD;
      questionnaire and do a wrap up interview. The end-of-trial qualitative interview will&#xD;
      evaluate participant satisfaction and feasibility of the intervention. For this reason a lab&#xD;
      employee unaffiliated with this study will complete these interviews via skype or alternate&#xD;
      technology. The interview will be audio-recorded transcribed verbatim. After the intervention&#xD;
      group participants have completed the 6 week online program, data collection will be complete&#xD;
      and while they may still access the platform for an additional 6 weeks, data collection from&#xD;
      participants or website use analytics will not be ongoing.&#xD;

    <measure>Recruitment rate (monthly)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the full scale RCT, we are looking for a 1 day per week or 30 min MVPA change which equates to an approximate effect size of d = .35. This equates to roughly 65 per group (130 for a two group trial). If we recruit for 2 years in the large trial (assuming a six month time period for each person in the intervention) we need to be recruiting at least 6 per month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant retention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who complete both baseline and end of study (6 week) measures. A 80-100% retention rate is indicative of a strong trial (Jackson &amp; Waters, 2005).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant intervention satisfaction/evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For satisfaction ratings, mean and standard deviations will be calculated for the quantitative satisfaction and evaluation questionnaire. Given that scores of 1 (ex. not helpful, did not use the tools) and 2 (ex. Somewhat helpful, used a little bit of the tools) indicated levels of dissatisfaction, and 3 (ex. Quite helpful, used a bit of the tools) and 4 (ex. Extremely helpful, used a lot of the tools) indicated some sort of satisfaction, a mean score of â‰¥ 2.5 will be deemed acceptable for recommendation for a full RCT.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a baseline questionnaire, and receive access to the our online platform for 6 weeks. Completing the online platform is designed to encourage participants to engage in physical activity. At 3 weeks, a check-in session will occur over the phone. At 6 weeks the participant will be contacted to complete the final questionnaire, and do a wrap up interview. The end-of-trial qualitative interview will evaluate participant satisfaction and feasibility of the intervention. For this reason a lab employee unaffiliated with this study will complete these in person interviews.</description>
