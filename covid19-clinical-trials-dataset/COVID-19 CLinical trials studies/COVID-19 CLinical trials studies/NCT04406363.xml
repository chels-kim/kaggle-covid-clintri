  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current situation, linked to the pandemic of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 generates&#xD;
      health concerns, but is also accompanied by many other psychological, social, economic,&#xD;
      professional, etc. consequences as well as numerous changes in behavior and lifestyles,&#xD;
      notably due to confinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the prevention of chronic low back pain and its management are primarily based on the&#xD;
      practice of regular physical and sports activity, other psychological factors (stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression), socioeconomic (low level of education, resources), professionals&#xD;
      (physical workload, job dissatisfaction), etc. also have a major role in the onset and the&#xD;
      persitence of low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is to be supposed that the current context, and more particularly the confinement to&#xD;
      which the population has been constrained for almost 2 months, have and will have notable&#xD;
      consequences on the evolution of lumbar symptoms in chronic low back pain patients. However,&#xD;
      the entanglement of different factors related to containment will potentially have different&#xD;
      consequences depending on the individual. It therefore seems difficult to predict how the&#xD;
      lumbar symptoms will develop in this population. Indeed, if it can imagined that the decrease&#xD;
      in regular physical activity and the increase in anxiety in this context of insecurity could&#xD;
      lead to an increase in pain, it could just as well consider that the decrease in stress work,&#xD;
      strenuous physical work or travel time from work to home can, on the contrary, have a&#xD;
      favorable effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the confinement effect on low back pain intensity in&#xD;
      chronic low back pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, descriptive, transversal and pluricentric study conducted by a&#xD;
      single questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who consulted one of the study investigators (rheumatologist and algologist) for the&#xD;
      management of a common chronic low back pain between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020&#xD;
      (begining of the French confinement) and who meet inclusion criteria will be offered to&#xD;
      participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjets will be preselected by the study investigators (from the medical file). The&#xD;
      initial solicitation of a potential subject will be made by a phone contact by the&#xD;
      investigator who treat him/her for his chronic low back pain. Subjects who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be offered to respond to a questionnaire by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire (no more than 10 minutes) will assess the sociodemographic status, the&#xD;
      confinement conditions, the new coranavirus infection status, changes in low back pain&#xD;
      intensity during the confinement, incapacity related to low back pain, physical activities&#xD;
      practice before and during the confinement, anxiety and depression, continuation of&#xD;
      occupational activity and teleworking practice during the confienment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of confinement on change in low back&#xD;
      pain intensity. The main endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a significant change in&#xD;
      their low back pain during confinement, defined by the items &quot;much worse&quot; and &quot;moderately&#xD;
      worse&quot;, or &quot;much improved&quot; and &quot;moderately improved&quot; respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the association between the conditions of confinement and low back pain intensity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the association between the confinement conditions and disability related to low back&#xD;
           pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the association between infection with the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and change in low&#xD;
           back pain intensity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the association between the confinement conditions and the quality of life as well as&#xD;
           the state of psychological health;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the impact of confinement on the use of care and the consumption of medication and&#xD;
           psychoactive substances for low back pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. the association between working conditions and / or teleworking and the low back pain&#xD;
           intensity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. the association between socio-economic factors and modalities as well as the experience&#xD;
           of confinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the exploratory nature of this study, the required number of subjects is empirically&#xD;
      estimated at 350 subjects in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative and quantitative data will be described (averages or percentages). A chiÂ² test&#xD;
      will be performed to compare the percentages between the different subgroups studied. A&#xD;
      Student test will be carried out to compare the means between the different subgroups&#xD;
      studied. An alpha risk of less than 5% will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the parameters of interest studied, the bivariate analysis may be supplemented by&#xD;
      a multivariate analysis adapted to the criterion to be explained if the conditions of&#xD;
      validity of this multivariate analysis are met.&#xD;
