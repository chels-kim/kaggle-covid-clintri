  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CSL760 is a human hyperimmune product of the purified gamma immunoglobulin (IgG) fraction of&#xD;
      human plasma containing polyvalent neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). CSL is evaluating CSL760 as a passive immunotherapy for&#xD;
      COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019).&#xD;

    <ipd_description>CSL will consider requests to share Individual Patient Data (IPD) from systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers. For information on the process and requirements for submitting a voluntary data sharing request for IPD, please contact CSL at clinicaltrials@cslbehring.com.&#xD;
Applicable country specific privacy and other laws and regulations will be considered and may prevent sharing of IPD.&#xD;
If the request is approved and the researcher has executed an appropriate data sharing agreement, IPD that has been appropriately anonymized will be available.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_info_type>Study Protocol</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_info_type>Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_time_frame>IPD requests may be submitted to CSL no earlier than 12 months after publication of the results of this study via an article made available on a public website.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Requests may only be made by systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers whose proposed use of the IPD is non-commercial in nature and has been approved by an internal review committee.&#xD;
An IPD request will not be considered by CSL unless the proposed research question seeks to answer a significant and unknown medical science or patient care question as determined by CSL's internal review committee.&#xD;
The requesting party must execute an appropriate data sharing agreement before IPD will be made available.</ipd_access_criteria>
