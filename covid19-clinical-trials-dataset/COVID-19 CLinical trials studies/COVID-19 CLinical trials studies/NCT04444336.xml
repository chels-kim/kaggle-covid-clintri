  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the association between the use different information sources&#xD;
      to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of psychopathology (i.e.,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How central are different sources of information used to obtain knowledge about the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in network along with depressive and anxiety symptoms? Which sources of information&#xD;
      are most strongly connected to different symptoms of depression and anxiety? Staying away&#xD;
      from information will be measured in the present study. As avoidance is a type of safety&#xD;
      behavior in anxiety disorders, we are further eager to investigate the centrality of this&#xD;
      behavior in the network. Furthermore, multiple studies using latent-variable paradigms have&#xD;
      established a relationship between sum-scores of depression and social anxiety use in&#xD;
      general. We are further interested in examining this potential link more thoroughly and&#xD;
      detailed in the present network study. The findings of this study, although they will be&#xD;
      cross-sectional and require further examination in studies with temporal data structure, will&#xD;
      be an important and interesting starting point giving initial ideas about potential&#xD;
      mechanisms that may be involved in use of information sources in pandemics and mental health&#xD;

      Research Question 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How central are different sources of information used to obtain knowledge about the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in network along with depressive and anxiety symptoms? Which sources of information&#xD;
      are most strongly connected to different symptoms of depression and anxiety?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staying away from information will be measured in the present study. As avoidance is a type&#xD;
      of safety behavior in anxiety disorders, the investigators are further eager to investigate&#xD;
      the centrality of this behavior in the network. Furthermore, multiple studies using&#xD;
      latent-variable paradigms have established a relationship between sum-scores of depression&#xD;
      and social anxiety use in general. The investigators are further interested in examining this&#xD;
      potential link more thoroughly and detailed in the present network study. The findings of&#xD;
      this study, although they will be cross-sectional and require further examination in studies&#xD;
      with temporal data structure, will be an important and interesting starting point giving&#xD;
      initial ideas about potential mechanisms that may be involved in use of information sources&#xD;
      in pandemics and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated network will consist of 23 items (9: PHQ-9; 7: GAD-7; 7: information sources to&#xD;
      obtain information about COVID-19). The network will be estimated using the R package qgraph&#xD;
      (Epskamp et al., 2012). Network stability and accuracy tests will be conducted using R&#xD;
      package bootnet (Epskamp, et al., 2018). An undirected partial correlation network will be&#xD;
      estimated, resulting in associations between each pair of symptoms controlling for all other&#xD;
      associations among symptoms. Centrality indices will be reported. The appropriate correlation&#xD;
      method will be applied following an assessment of the data (e.g., with regards to possible&#xD;
      skewness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The network will further be regularized using Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and&#xD;
      Selection Operator (GLASSO), with Extended Bayes Information Criterion (EBIC). The tuning&#xD;
      parameter will be set to 0.5, as is recommended practice. Centrality table and plots will be&#xD;
      depicted, and difference test of edges conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will investigate differences in network structure across&#xD;
      major demographic subgroups in the sample (e.g., gender). All analyses and questions&#xD;
      addressed in the forthcoming paper that are not pre-specified in this pre-registered protocol&#xD;
      will be defined as exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sources of information include: 1) National television and radio channels; 2) national&#xD;
      and regional, and local newspapers; 3) Use of social media for information; 4) use of blogs,&#xD;
      podcasts, forums or other Internet sources; 5) information obtained from peers (i.e., friends&#xD;
      and family); 6) Other sources of information; 7) actively staying away from information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      p &lt; 0.05 to determine significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following power analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer (2017), it is recommended that the&#xD;
      number of participants are three times larger than the number of estimated parameters.&#xD;
      However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975) for multivariate research,&#xD;
      recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of estimated parameters. The&#xD;
      network to be constructed for this study consists of 7 anxiety items (GAD-7), 9 depression&#xD;
      symptom items (PHQ-9), and the 7 pre-specified items above concerning medium of information&#xD;
      and extent of use. Consequently, the network consists of 23 items. 23x(23-1)/2 x 3 = at least&#xD;
      759 participants (according to guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer, 2017). Thus, following these two&#xD;
      approaches respectively, between 759 to 2530 participants are required. Data will be&#xD;
      collected for three weeks, and participants are based on a representative sample of Norwegian&#xD;
      adults with equal opportunity to partake in the study following providing digital consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TSD system (Services for Sensitive Data), a platform used in Norway to store&#xD;
      person-sensitive data verifies participants officially through a kind of national ID number&#xD;
      to give them full right to withdraw their data at any time, following the European GDPR&#xD;
      (General Data Protection Regulation) laws. Accordingly, participants are allowed to withdraw&#xD;
      their own data at any time. The survey includes mandatory fields of response. Participation&#xD;
      is voluntarily, and withdrawal of any provided data is possible at any moment. The&#xD;
      investigators do not expect participants to withdraw their data and thus expect no missing&#xD;
      data. However, if participants do withdraw their data, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      state-of-art missing data analysis and investigate whether data is missing at random.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer &amp; Williams, 2001) is used to measure symptoms of depression in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. The questionnaire consists of nine items where each is scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the range of scores from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, and scores above 10 are considered as the cut-off that indicating that the patient is within the depressive area.</description>

    <time_frame>Data is set to be collected starting from 22nd of June until enough data has been collected. The data collection period will last no longer than three weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams &amp; Löwe, 2006) is a questionnaire consisting of seven items measuring symptoms of anxiety and worry. The items are scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the scores ranging from 0 to 21. Specific cut-off for Norwegian samples have been found yielding a cut-off of 8 and above for high sensitivity and specificity (Johnson, Ulvenes, Øktedalen &amp; Hoffart, 2019).</description>
