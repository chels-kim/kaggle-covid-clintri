  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, hospital-acquired weakness is highly prevalent among COVID-19 hospitalized&#xD;
      patients, who often require prolonged bed-rest or paralytics for an extended period of time&#xD;
      in order to maintain oxygenation. Prolonged bed rest has been associated with pronounced loss&#xD;
      of muscle mass that can exceed 10% over the 1st week, which leads to functional impairment&#xD;
      and complications post-hospital discharge. Physical therapy and in-hospital mobility program&#xD;
      may reduce the incident of hospital-acquired weakness, but they are often impractical for&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. In particular, conventional mobility programs are challenging for those&#xD;
      who are being treated in an intensive Care Unit. The purpose of this study is to test&#xD;
      feasibility and proof-of-concept effectiveness of daily use of lower extremity electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (EE) therapy, as a practical solution to retain lower extremity muscle mass, to&#xD;
      address chronic morbid consequences of COVID-19 including hospital-acquired weakness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test feasibility and proof-of-concept effectiveness of lower&#xD;
      extremity electrical stimulation (EE) therapy to address chronic morbid consequences of&#xD;
      COVID-19 including hospital-acquired weakness and neuropathy. This is a proof of concept&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) study. Eligible participants (n=20 anticipated) will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Baylor St. Luke's' Medical Center (Houston, Texas). To be eligible&#xD;
      participants should be hospitalized because of COVID-19 infection and suspected to be at risk&#xD;
      for hospital acquired-weakness based on judgment of clinical intensivist investigators.&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded if they are paralyzed. Other exclusion criteria include blow&#xD;
      the knee amputation, those who have a demand-type cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator&#xD;
      or other implanted electronic device; those with wound infection, and other conditions that&#xD;
      may interfere with outcomes or increase the risk of the use EE based on judgement of&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that implementation of EE as means of regular activation of&#xD;
      lower extremity muscle is feasible and acceptable for the target population and would help to&#xD;
      retain lower extremity muscle mass, lower extremity tissue oxygen saturation and perfusion,&#xD;
      and thus reducing the severity of hospital acquired weakness and potentially improve outcomes&#xD;
      of treatment among COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to intervention (IG) or control group (CG)). The entire&#xD;
      cohort will receive daily EE in lower extremity (e.g. Gastronemius, tibial anterior muscle)&#xD;
      up to 1 hour. EE therapy will be provided using a bio-electric stimulation technology (BEST)&#xD;
      platform (Tennant Biomodulator PROÂ®, AVAZZIA, Inc.). The EE device will be functional for IG&#xD;
      and non-functional for CG. The primary outcomes include between group difference and change&#xD;
      from the baseline in muscle function, muscle strength, lower extremity tissue oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, neuropathy, and muscle atrophy. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, time of&#xD;
      discharge or 4 weeks, whichever came first.&#xD;
