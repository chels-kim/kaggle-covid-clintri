      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform COVID-19 diagnostic and serologic testing on emergency medical personnel in Polk&#xD;
      County to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. COVID-19 prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of convalesced personnel (+antibodies)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rate of asymptomatic carriers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This observational study involves a community wide program offering free COVID-19 testing to&#xD;
      county front line workers, including EMS personnel, board of county commissioners and&#xD;
      sheriffs' office personnel. These personnel will also be asked to fill out a survey that asks&#xD;
      about their medical history and which of any symptoms they have experienced in the prior&#xD;
      three weeks. The survey is voluntary and written informed consent is obtained . EMS personnel&#xD;
      can still get the free testing even if they do not want to fill out the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 antigen and IgM&#xD;
      and IgG markers amongst our county/EMS workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to describe whether the antigen/antibody markers are significantly&#xD;
      correlated to the presence of a set of symptoms in the prior 3 weeks, and/or to the baseline&#xD;
      demographics such as age, sex, and presence of co-morbidities.&#xD;
