  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with acute pulmonary and cardiac injury. To better understand the&#xD;
      degree and severity of cardiopulmonary injury as well as short and long-term sequelae of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, this study will perform longitudinal study in patients who had recent&#xD;
      known diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives for this study include providing structural and function information about&#xD;
      lung and heart using chest imaging, MRI, Echo, Spirometry, and blood markers in order to&#xD;
      assess severity of cardiopulmonary injury and short- and long-term sequelae of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection as well as assess indicators of mental health and quality of life.&#xD;
