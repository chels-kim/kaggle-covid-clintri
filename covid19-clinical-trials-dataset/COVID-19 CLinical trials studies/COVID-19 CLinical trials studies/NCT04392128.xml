  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 2, multicentric, placebo-controlled double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and&#xD;
      azithromycine on the viral load drop at day 5 among patients with COVID-19 and hematological&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycine&#xD;
      versus placebo among 114 patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization in 1:1 ratio, patients will receive either the study treatment or placebo&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients enrolled in the experimental arm will receive hydroxychloroquine (200mgx3&#xD;
           tablets per day during 10 days) and azithromycine (500 mg at day 1 then 250mg per day&#xD;
           during 4 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients enrolled in the control arm will receive a placebo of hydroxychloroquine (3&#xD;
           tablets per day during 10 days) and a placebo of azithromycine (2 capsules at day 1,&#xD;
           then 1 capsule per day during 4 days)&#xD;
