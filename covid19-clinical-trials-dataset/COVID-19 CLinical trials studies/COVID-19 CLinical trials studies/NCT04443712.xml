      The objective of this study is to screen the patients seeking hospitalization in Ain Shams&#xD;
      university hospitals and identify a cost effective tool for continuing screening the patients&#xD;
      all through the epidemic period&#xD;

      Study setting: Ain-Shams University Hospitals. It is a campus including the following main&#xD;
      hospitals: Gynecology and Obstetrics, Oncology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Internal Medicine,&#xD;
      surgical, cardiothoracic and Geriatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients needing admission in Ain-Shams University Hospitals are&#xD;
      eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: There is no incidence data published till now. Only the confirmed detected cases&#xD;
      have been reported. We assumed that the community cases are around 10 times that of detected&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it was estimated to be 1900 patients with 95% confidence level given the frequency of&#xD;
      positive screening 0.05% with precision Â± 0.1%. 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled in the study using consecutive sample till the sample size is&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every enrolled patient will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An interview questionnaire including personal data ( age, gender, residence , contact&#xD;
           details ) , epidemiological data (history of contact to a COVID-19 case, History of&#xD;
           travel), clinical data history ( Fever, Cough, sore throat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Antibody IgM-IgG test for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be validated, cleaned and entered in spreadsheet. SPSS program will be used for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be presented in frequency and related percentage. Quantitative data&#xD;
      with normal distribution will be presented in mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      interquartile for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of positive screening test among the total will be calculated with 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups will be done using relevant suitable parametric or non-parametric&#xD;
      tests. A &quot;P&quot; value of 0.05 is decided to be the level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk ratios will be calculated for estimation of risk with 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost per one positive detected screening test will be calculated (Total cost / total positive&#xD;
      cases). The direct and indirect costs will be calculated by the laboratory department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be submitted for approval by the University Ethical Research Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives and methods of the research will be explained to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent will be obtained from subjects willing to participate in the research and&#xD;
      the subjects are free to withdraw from research anytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of the data will be highly secured. Positive cases will be reported to the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP). The guidelines of isolation and treatment protocol&#xD;
      of MOHP will be followed.&#xD;
