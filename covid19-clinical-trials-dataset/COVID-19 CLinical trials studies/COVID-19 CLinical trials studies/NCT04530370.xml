    <textblock>
      The discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the&#xD;
      outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are causing public health emergencies. A&#xD;
      handful pieces of literature have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas&#xD;
      therapies for COVID-19 are rather limited. To evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma&#xD;
      therapy in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious pulmonary disease caused by a&#xD;
      newly discovered strains of coronavirus family. The clinical pictures could range from a&#xD;
      symptomatic to severe and can lead to hospitalization, breathing difficulties and death.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no vaccine or specific treatment is available so far. 1 There have been&#xD;
      encouraging clinical researches using immunotherapy as a recent treatment modality against&#xD;
      Covid 19 viral infections. Of particular interest, is passive immunotherapy which is the&#xD;
      passive transfer of readymade antibodies (humoral immunity) from recovered individuals to&#xD;
      patients in active illness. 2 Plasma of recovered patients, a classic cell transfer therapy,&#xD;
      has been used successfully to prevent and treat many infectious diseases in the past&#xD;
      including: H1N1 pandemic influenza A, avian influenza A (H5N1), SARS-CoV and, Ebola virus&#xD;
      disease, MERS-CoV respiratory syncytial virus, Zika viruses, human cytomegalovirus and&#xD;
      rabies. Unfortunately, recovered plasma did not show successful results in combating Ebola&#xD;
      outbreak3 Neutralizing antibody from recovered SARS patients could interfere with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      from penetrating through host cells in vitro. 4 Moreover, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from&#xD;
      recovered SARS-CoV patients were highly correlated, peaking at month 4 after the onset of&#xD;
      disease, could be titrated in plasma of 90% of patients for as long as 2 years, decreasing&#xD;
      gradually thereafter.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is a member of β-coronavirus family. It is a single-stranded RNA genome consists&#xD;
      of 30 kb nucleotides, which transcript 4 main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M),&#xD;
      envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The virus characteristic appearance stems from,&#xD;
      the S protein which is club shape glycoprotein radiating in a crown like configuration. 6&#xD;
      Genome researches have shown that interlocking between the receptor-binding domain of S&#xD;
      protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into the&#xD;
      host cells. 7 The similarity of the receptor-binding sites between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV&#xD;
      explains their shared pathogenicity and biological traits. Moreover, both covid-19 and SARS&#xD;
      share common clinical (fever, cough, body aches, and dyspnea) and typical radiological&#xD;
      manifestations (multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and subsegmental areas of&#xD;
      consolidation). 8 Nevertheless, both viruses are highly contagious with incubation period&#xD;
      range from several days to two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection produce different antibodies against different viral&#xD;
      antigenic proteins (epitomes), and some of these antibodies mediate their action by virus&#xD;
      neutralization or by phagocytosis and antibody gated cell toxicity.9 There have been&#xD;
      published studies claiming successful patient outcome after transfusion of recovered plasma.&#xD;
      One study showed improved clinical pictures, higher discharge rate. 10 Another study&#xD;
      demonstrated that viral RNA disappeared in patient serums a week post transfusion. 11 Another&#xD;
      study compared the clinical improvement of recovered plasma transfusion with steroids in SARS&#xD;
      patients with critical condition. They observed that recovered plasma patients had a high&#xD;
      hospital discharge rate, better clinical outcome than the steroid group, with no transfusion&#xD;
      related unwanted effects.12 A large meta-analysis of 1703 influenza pneumonia patients who&#xD;
      had been transfused recovered plasma, showed a marked decrease of viral load and 21% decrease&#xD;
      in mortality. 13 There are fast growing numbers of new COVID-19 cases every day, and&#xD;
      disease-related morbidity and mortality is increasing. The purpose of our study was to test&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of transfusing plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19,&#xD;
      to patients with COVID-19 in severe condition.&#xD;

    <description>Patients' response to recovered Covid 19 plasma (RCP) during 5 days after transfusion, was our primary goal. It was categorized into either satisfactory or unsatisfactory outcomes. We defined satisfactory outcome as two or more of the following 4 conditions/ or otherwise unsatisfactory: 1. respiratory frequency &lt; 30/min, 2. Sustain blood oxygen saturation ≥93% on room air, 3. partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &gt; 300 mmHg, 4. Regression of pulmonary infiltrates occupying less than 50% of both lungs.</description>
