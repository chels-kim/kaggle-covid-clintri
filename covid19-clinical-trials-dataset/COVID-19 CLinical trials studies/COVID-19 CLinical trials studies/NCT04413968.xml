    <textblock>
      According to epidemiological models, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in&#xD;
      Île-de-France as of 11 May was between 10 and 15%. Preliminary data on the number of&#xD;
      professionals evicted from nurseries on suspicion of COVID-19 (on clinical grounds) seem to&#xD;
      be of the same order of magnitude, but need to be confirmed by a biological technique.&#xD;
      Children would be susceptible to infection but often asymptomatic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2, an emerging respiratory virus of the coronavirus family, is responsible for a&#xD;
      global pandemic of which Europe has become the epicentre. Infection with the virus causes a&#xD;
      disease called COVID-19, whose expression most often includes cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia,&#xD;
      anosmia, ageusia and gastrointestinal symptoms, and which can be complicated by severe&#xD;
      pneumonia requiring resuscitation and which can lead to death. Morbidity and mortality are&#xD;
      clearly age-related and while illness and hospitalisations occur in all age groups, deaths&#xD;
      occur mostly in the older age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of curative treatment and vaccination, the only real measures capable of&#xD;
      slowing the progression of the disease are large-scale social distancing measures. In analogy&#xD;
      to community-based viral epidemics such as seasonal influenza, children were initially&#xD;
      considered a potential vector of transmission, which led to the preventive measure of school&#xD;
      closures. In France, this closure came into force on 14 March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are considered to be little affected by the coronavirus-19 epidemic because even if&#xD;
      screening strategies differ, they represent less than 3% of the cases confirmed in the&#xD;
      various studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a period of confinement and reduction in the number of children cared for, in a crèche for&#xD;
      children of healthcare workers, in a context of proximity and high risk of cross&#xD;
      transmission, the frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of SARS-Cov-2 in children&#xD;
      and staff would be comparable to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize a susceptibility to infection in children but low transmission, which should&#xD;
      lead to a cumulative prevalence of infection among daycare staff comparable to that obtained&#xD;
      in a sample of professionals who do not come into contact with children in their work (here&#xD;
      hospital laboratory and administrative staff).&#xD;
