      An open two stage non-randomized Phase 1 study with the participation of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      This clinical trial is an open study of safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the drug&#xD;
      &quot;Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo&quot;, lyophilisate for the preparation of a solution for intramuscular&#xD;
      administration, with the participation of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A safety and tolerability assessment of the drug &quot;Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo&quot;, lyophilisate for&#xD;
           the preparation of a solution for intramuscular administration, using single dose of&#xD;
           each component (Stage 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A safety and tolerability assessment of the drug &quot;Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo&quot;, lyophilisate for&#xD;
           the preparation of a solution for intramuscular administration, using prime-boost&#xD;
           immunization according to the proposed scheme (Stage 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Stage 1 the First group, 9 volunteers, will receive the drug, a solution for&#xD;
      intramuscular administration, in the mode of single immunization with component 1 in a full&#xD;
      therapeutic dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the Second group, 9 volunteers, will receive the drug, a solution for intramuscular&#xD;
      administration, in the mode of single immunization with component 2 in the full therapeutic&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied drugs will be administered to a total of 18 volunteers in a hospital setting and&#xD;
      after administration, the drug's safety will be continuously monitored for 5 days. Based on&#xD;
      the results of the safety assessment, the Chief investigator decides to proceed to the second&#xD;
      stage of the study on the 5th day after the introduction of the studied drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage The second stage will include 20 volunteers and three understudies. Volunteers&#xD;
      of the second stage will be vaccinated no earlier than 5 days after vaccination of&#xD;
      participants of the first stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers participating in the second stage of the study (a total of 20 people) will receive&#xD;
      the study drug according to the booster scheme: the introduction of component 1 will be&#xD;
      carried out on day 1, and component 2-on the 21st day of the study. Follow-up will be carried&#xD;
      out during 4 visits: on 7, 14, 28, 42 days after administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the inpatient observation and the follow-up period (180 days) of visits during the&#xD;
      entire study, safety information will be collected&#xD;
