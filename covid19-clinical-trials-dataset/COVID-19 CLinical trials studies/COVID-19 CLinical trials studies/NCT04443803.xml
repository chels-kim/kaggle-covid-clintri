  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a case-series analysis, 9 patients undergoing elective or urgent/emergent surgery that are&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive will be approached for patient consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR PathTrac (RDB Bioinformatics, Omaha, NE 68154) collection kits will be utilized for&#xD;
      sampling of 48 sampled time/locations per patient. Patient sampling locations will include&#xD;
      the nasopharynx and oropharynx. Operating room environmental locations will include areas in&#xD;
      the patient care arena such as the anesthesia machine. Samples of each location will be&#xD;
      obtained before and after treatment with UV-C (Helios, Surfacide), germicidal, ultraviolet&#xD;
      light and other infection control practices that are currently in place, such as utilization&#xD;
      of preoperative chlorhexidine wipes, nasal iodine, improved hand hygiene, and improved&#xD;
      vascular care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UV-C light for environmental cleaning is not regulated by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be processed by RT-PCR for presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Positive samples&#xD;
      will be sent to Dr. Stanley Perlman's lab to assess viability. Samples will also be assessed&#xD;
      for S. aureus as a process control. We will characterize the epidemiology of perioperative&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 spread as a quality improvement initiative to improve our current perioperative&#xD;
      infection control bundle and to serve as the platform for national dissemination of a&#xD;
      perioperative COVID-19 defense strategy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The operating room schedule will be reviewed each day by a research assistant for COVID-19&#xD;
      positive patients. Additionally, the research assistant will receive a page for every&#xD;
      emergency surgery that takes place in the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR PathTrac collection kits will be utilized for sampling of 48 specific locations/times&#xD;
      throughout each case. These samples include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  11 samples that have been routinely used for S. aureus including nasopharyngeal.&#xD;
           Normally there are 13, but 2 samples are included in the subsequent environmental&#xD;
           locations: the adjustable pressure-limiting valve and agent dial at baseline and case&#xD;
           end.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 sample from the endotracheal tube tip at case end, as positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 environmental locations at case end including anesthesia machine and each of the air&#xD;
           vents,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 environmental locations matched after environmental cleaning, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 environmental locations matched after Surfacide Helios UV-C cleaning. The Surfacide&#xD;
           Helios UV-C cleaning robots will be used after all normal environmental cleaning of the&#xD;
           room has taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transmission event will be defined as 2 samples with detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR,&#xD;
      with samples obtained from 2 distinct, epidemiologically-related reservoirs within a&#xD;
      surveillance unit. The OR PathTrac software platform will process transmission dynamics in&#xD;
      order to continually summarize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV transmission, with results&#xD;
      updated daily as case-pair data is continually entered into the program. This information&#xD;
      will be continually displayed to identify the most common reservoir of origin, the most&#xD;
      common transmission locations (vectors), and involvement of key portals of entry (stopcocks).&#xD;
      These will become improvement targets with feedback provided via automated failure mode&#xD;
      analysis reports. The research assistants will use the reports to continually optimize the&#xD;
      interventions during the observational period. The incidence and epidemiology of transmission&#xD;
      will be mapped before and after UV-C treatment and positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 examined&#xD;
      for viability by a UIHC laboratory.&#xD;
