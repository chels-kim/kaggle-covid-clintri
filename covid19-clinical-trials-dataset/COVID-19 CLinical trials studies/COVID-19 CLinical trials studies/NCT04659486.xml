    <textblock>
      This is a protocol aimed at children and adolescents contaminated with COVID, treated at the&#xD;
      Hospital das Clínicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil (HCFMUSP), in the recovery phase. The&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the spectrum of pathogenic lesions of the virus not only in the&#xD;
      respiratory system, but digestive, immunological, neurological and others. Clinical,&#xD;
      evolutionary, laboratory and functional parameters will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      School-age children and adolescents COVID-19 survivors may have persistent inflammation, a&#xD;
      chronic course of COVID-19, with isolated or concomitant aggressions of various organs and&#xD;
      systems, making this disease a potential chronic condition, impacting aspects of quality of&#xD;
      life related to health (HRQoL), physical and mental health. In addition, pediatric COVID-19&#xD;
      can induce autoimmunity (with the possibility of primary hypothyroidism and type I diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus), delayed linear growth and delayed pubertal development, secondary immunodeficiency&#xD;
      and present genetic polymorphisms in brain plasticity impacting rehabilitation. School-aged&#xD;
      children and adolescents with COVID-19 could present muscle weakness, dysautonomy, asthenia&#xD;
      and physical inactivity, so it is essential that safe and effective interventions are&#xD;
      developed to maintain adequate levels of physical activity and that they can be implemented&#xD;
      on a large scale. However, to date, there are no systematic longitudinal studies that have&#xD;
      evaluated all these aspects in a pediatric population that survived COVID-19, particularly&#xD;
      with chronic conditions and who were hospitalized in a tertiary service.&#xD;

Scores ≥60 (for DASS-total) and ≥21 (for the depression subscale) are labeled as &quot;high&quot; or &quot;severe&quot;.</description>
