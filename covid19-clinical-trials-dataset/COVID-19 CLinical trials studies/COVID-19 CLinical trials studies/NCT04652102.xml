             {defined as amenorrhea for ≥12 consecutive months prior to screening (Day 1) without&#xD;
             an alternative medical cause}. A follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be&#xD;
             measured at the discretion of the Investigator to confirm postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential: negative urine pregnancy test (hCG) within 24 hours&#xD;
             prior to each trial vaccination on Day 1 and Day 29.&#xD;

          -  Females of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of birth control&#xD;
             from 2 weeks before the first administration of the trial vaccine until 3 months&#xD;

             considered highly effective when used consistently and correctly:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
                  (oral, injectable or implantable);&#xD;

             preceding the administration of trial vaccine or planned use during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any licensed vaccines within 28 days (for live vaccines) or 14 days (for&#xD;
             inactivated vaccines) prior to administration of the first trial vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of any investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or another coronavirus&#xD;
             (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) vaccine or planned used during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any treatment with immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs (including but&#xD;
             not limited to corticosteroids, biologicals and methotrexate) for &gt; 14 days total&#xD;
             within 6 months preceding the administration of trial vaccine or planned use during&#xD;
             the trial. For corticosteroid use, this means prednisone or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day&#xD;
             for 14 days or more. The use of inhaled, topical, or localized injections of&#xD;
             corticosteroids (e.g., for joint pain/inflammation) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition&#xD;
             based on medical history and physical examination including known infection with human&#xD;

             current diagnosis of or treatment for cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#xD;
             disease, multiple myeloma or generalized malignancy; chronic renal failure or&#xD;
             nephrotic syndrome; and receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic), any anaphylactic reactions or pIMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to any component of CVnCoV.&#xD;

             administration of trial vaccine or planned receipt during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes trial participation (e.g., may increase&#xD;
             the risk of trial participation, render the participant unable to meet the&#xD;
             requirements of the trial, or may interfere with the participant's trial evaluations).&#xD;
             These include severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disease, liver disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disorder, and&#xD;
             neurological and psychiatric illnesses. However, those with controlled and stable&#xD;
             cases can be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with impaired coagulation or any bleeding disorder in whom an&#xD;
             intramuscular injection or a blood draw is contraindicated.&#xD;
