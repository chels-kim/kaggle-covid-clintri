  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, people's lives have changed dramatically. People with lung&#xD;
      cancer who are shielding may have been particularly affected as they may be unable to carry&#xD;
      out many of their normal daily activities, such as grocery shopping and exercise, and are&#xD;
      unable to interact with friends and family. People with lung cancer will also have&#xD;
      experienced some changes to the clinical services available to them at The Christie. Using a&#xD;
      questionnaire and interviews, the investigators want to understand patient experiences of the&#xD;
      changes in their daily lives and the changes to their clinical care. This will help us to see&#xD;
      if people with lung cancer need any additional support services or if there are any changes&#xD;
      the investigators can make to clinical services to improve patient experiences. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be any lung cancer patients receiving current treatment or in active follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020, has&#xD;
      managed to dramatically change all of our lives in just a few short months. Due to the&#xD;
      unprecedented demand to protect the National Health service (NHS), on 23 March 2020 the&#xD;
      United Kingdom (UK) government initiated a lock down, imposing wide-ranging restrictions on&#xD;
      freedom of movement. Cancer services have been being particularly impacted across the&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 48,000 patients are newly diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK each year. Those who&#xD;
      require active treatment may be offered radiotherapy, systemic anticancer therapy including&#xD;
      chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy, or a combination of both. A recent document&#xD;
      published by Public Health England(PHE) has classified lung cancer patients receiving any of&#xD;
      these treatments as 'extremely vulnerable.' Common co-existing comorbidities such as Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) also place patients into this category. Their&#xD;
      vulnerability may be further amplified when considering that 44% of all new lung cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses are in people aged &gt;75 years and a significant proportion is particularly frail.&#xD;
      The advice from PHE for these 'extremely vulnerable' patients was to shield, meaning they&#xD;
      should not leave their homes or attend any social gatherings, even with family or friends.&#xD;
      Shielding unfortunately is not without its own challenges. It may prevent many patients from&#xD;
      carrying out their daily life activities independently, limit their ability to exercise and&#xD;
      impact their mental further. This is particularly relevant for those patients more vulnerable&#xD;
      or frail. It would therefore be expected that these patients are likely to develop some&#xD;
      degree of psychological distress. The act of shielding itself may be implicated in this owing&#xD;
      to increased social isolation, upset to normal routines and general anxiety regarding&#xD;
      COVID-19 related or other issues. In addition any change to routine lung cancer management in&#xD;
      these patients may exacerbate this distress further. Those with underlying mental health&#xD;
      issues are at particular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID-19 pandemic both the lung cancer diagnosis and its subsequent management&#xD;
      have been affected. These rapid changes reflected the shifting risk-benefit ratio for&#xD;
      patients and diminished resources. Beyond modifications in treatment pathways, telephone&#xD;
      consultations have replaced many face to face appointments in an attempt to reduce visits to&#xD;
      hospital. The use of electronic Health tools and telemedicine has therefore suddenly come to&#xD;
      the fore front of clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, all lung cancer patients have been given the&#xD;
      opportunity to regularly complete electronic patient reported outcome measures routinely as&#xD;
      part of their clinical care since December 2018. Patients are sent a text message either on&#xD;
      the day of a new patient appointment or three days before a follow-up appointment. They are&#xD;
      asked to complete the electronic Patient Reported Outcome Measures specifically selected for&#xD;
      each patient's diagnosis and treatment pathway including a list of symptoms based on the&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The EuroQual-5D quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      is also included. This allows clinicians to review patients' symptoms before the&#xD;
      consultation, allowing him/her to focus on the concerning symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
      issues. Moreover, all new lung cancer patients are also screened for frailty within the&#xD;
      Frailty Project through the electronic use of Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale which is&#xD;
      performed by clinicians.&#xD;
