      Screening Period = up to 7 days All screening procedures must be executed within the shortest&#xD;
      possible time frame before the scheduled date for Visit 1 (drug administration). The&#xD;
      laboratory and instrumental examination data obtained within 14 days before the screening&#xD;
      will be recorded as the screening data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include 110 volunteers that will be administered the study drug. Outpatient&#xD;
      observation will be done over the course of 4 visits: on day 10, 28, and 42 following drug&#xD;
      administration Along with that, the study will be continued in accordance with the Protocol,&#xD;
      accompanied by all the prescribed procedures and visits up to 180 days of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit No. 0 (outpatient): screening Visit No. 1 (outpatient): vaccination Visits No. 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      5, and 8: follow-up on days 10, 28, 42, 90, and180 after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 120 and 150, visits 6 and 7 will be accomplished by telephone contact / telemedicine&#xD;
      conference or, if necessary, in the form of an in-person visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any volunteer who received a dose of the study drug will be registered as a trial&#xD;
      participant, and his/her data will be used to help assess the drug's safety and tolerability.&#xD;
