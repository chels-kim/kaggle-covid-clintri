    <textblock>
      FDA-approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target the relapsing&#xD;
      phase of MS but have minimal impact once the progressive phase has begun. It is unclear if,&#xD;
      in the relapsing phase, there is an advantage of early aggressive therapy with respect to&#xD;
      preventing long-term disability. The infectious risks and other complications associated with&#xD;
      higher-efficacy treatments highlight the need to quantify their effectiveness in preventing&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRaditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for MS (TREAT-MS) trial is a pragmatic,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial that has two primary aims: 1) to evaluate, jointly and&#xD;
      independently among patients deemed at higher risk vs. lower risk for disability&#xD;
      accumulation, whether an &quot;early aggressive&quot; therapy approach, versus starting with a&#xD;
      traditional, first-line therapy, influences the intermediate-term risk of disability, and 2)&#xD;
      to evaluate if, among patients deemed at lower risk for disability who start on first-line MS&#xD;
      therapies but experience breakthrough disease, those who switch to a higher-efficacy versus a&#xD;
      new first-line therapy have different intermediate-term risk of disability.&#xD;

      FDA-approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target the relapsing&#xD;
      phase of MS but have minimal impact once the progressive phase has begun. It is unclear if,&#xD;
      in the relapsing phase, there is an advantage of early aggressive therapy with respect to&#xD;
      preventing long-term disability. The infectious risks and other complications associated with&#xD;
      higher-efficacy treatments highlight the need to quantify their effectiveness in preventing&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRaditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for MS (TREAT-MS) trial is a pragmatic,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial that has two primary aims: 1) to evaluate, jointly and&#xD;
      independently among patients deemed at higher risk vs. lower risk for disability&#xD;
      accumulation, whether an &quot;early aggressive&quot; therapy approach, versus starting with a&#xD;
      traditional, first-line therapy, influences the intermediate-term risk of disability, and 2)&#xD;
      to evaluate if, among patients deemed at lower risk for disability who start on first-line MS&#xD;
      therapies but experience breakthrough disease, those who switch to a higher-efficacy versus a&#xD;
      new first-line therapy have different intermediate-term risk of disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses/Objectives: The main hypothesis is that intermediate-term disability will be&#xD;
      reduced by earlier use of higher-efficacy medications. Additional objectives include a)&#xD;
      evaluating the magnitude of the treatment effect in patients deemed to be at higher risk&#xD;
      versus lower risk of longer-term disability (we hypothesize that the effect size will be&#xD;
      greater in the former group) and b) evaluating if, among those without indications of a high&#xD;
      risk of longer-term disability, breakthrough disease can be successfully managed by switching&#xD;
      to a different first-line therapy or if escalation is required at that time (we hypothesize&#xD;
      that switching to a higher-efficacy therapy will be more effective in preventing disability&#xD;
      in this group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a great unmet need to identify the most appropriate treatment strategy for people&#xD;
      with MS, especially early in the disease course when it may be possible to maximize an&#xD;
      individual's chance for preventing long-term disability. There is a paucity of evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines to help clinicians, patients, and payers determine which treatment strategy is&#xD;
      best for an individual with MS. Making treatment decisions is a daunting task, and the&#xD;
      individualized benefit-risk assessment becomes increasingly difficult as new therapies&#xD;
      emerge. Without the availability of direct comparative trials, clinicians and patients are&#xD;
      forced to scrutinize observational studies that only provide basic insights into what may be&#xD;
      the best treatment path moving forward. It is equally challenging to define what constitutes&#xD;
      a suboptimal response to a DMT for an individual patient. Clinicians lack guidance on when to&#xD;
      switch therapies and whether to consider a different first-line or if clinicians should&#xD;
      escalate immediately to higher-efficacy therapies, so further consensus is needed to&#xD;
      determine the optimal time to switch therapies and escalate therapy if an individual is on a&#xD;
      first-line therapy from the start. The TREAT-MS trial will help inform patients and the&#xD;
      broader health care community on whether patients would most benefit from early, possibly&#xD;
      more risky aggressive therapy or if starting with a less aggressive (and, often, less risky)&#xD;
      therapy, followed by a switch if breakthrough disease occurs, is warranted. In addition, this&#xD;
      study may help identify specific patient populations and/or short-term clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical biomarkers that are strongly predictive of long-term disability that can ensue&#xD;
      from MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual of sustained disability is the most feared complication for people with MS, and the&#xD;
      patient's own perception of their well-being or ill-being has a profound impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life. The heterogeneity and unpredictability of MS, along with lack of agreed upon&#xD;
      treatment guidelines, augments this fear, leading to a significant negative impact on quality&#xD;
      of life. Even patients who are deemed to have &quot;mild&quot; MS experience a significant negative&#xD;
      impact on their health-related quality of life that is similar in magnitude to what patients&#xD;
      with other severe chronic conditions (i.e., congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease) report. An extremely important goal for any intervention is to help&#xD;
      improve or maintain a high quality of life; therefore, in addition to classic clinical&#xD;
      endpoints (e.g. slowing disability progression), the TREAT-MS trial will capture several&#xD;
      important and meaningful PROs that will shed light on what treatment strategies may be the&#xD;
      best from a patient-centered perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Related Substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused clinical care&#xD;
      and research disruptions nationwide, including for patients enrolled in the TREAT-MS trial.&#xD;
      Many patients with MS, as well as their clinicians, are fearful that MS or the MS therapy&#xD;
      they are using may increase the risk or severity of COVID-19 infection. Whether a person with&#xD;
      early MS is more likely to experience more severe COVID-19 if treated with a higher-efficacy&#xD;
      therapy is not known. Further, whether COVID-19-induced disruptions in therapy or other&#xD;
      clinical care increase MS disease activity or MS symptoms is not clear but is relevant,&#xD;
      particularly since greater MS activity in the early therapeutic course is associated in&#xD;
      observational studies with worse long-term outcomes. Moreover, it is unclear if pre-pandemic&#xD;
      anxiety and depression, common comorbidities in people with MS, contribute to decisions to&#xD;
      delay care, overall or differently depending on therapeutic strategy (higher-efficacy vs.&#xD;
      traditional). TREAT-MS provides an optimal cohort in which to investigate the effect of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic on MS outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Substudy Aim 1. To evaluate if patients enrolled in TREAT-MS delayed or altered&#xD;
      their disease-modifying therapy schedule or other MS care, and whether such alterations are&#xD;
      associated with a greater degree of breakthrough inflammatory disease activity or the&#xD;
      development of new (or worsening baseline) MS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Substudy Aim 2: To evaluate if patients with MS treated with higher-efficacy, versus&#xD;
      traditional, therapies differ in the risk of severe COVID-19 infection, defined as requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization (with or without intubation) or mortality due to COVID-19.&#xD;
