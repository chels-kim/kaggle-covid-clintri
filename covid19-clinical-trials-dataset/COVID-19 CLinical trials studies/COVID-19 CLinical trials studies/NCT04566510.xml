  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Uganda, the National Malaria Control Division (NMCD) and implementing partners plan to&#xD;
      deliver long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) nationwide in 2020-21, through a mass&#xD;
      distribution campaign supported by generous contributions from international donors. LLINs&#xD;
      will be distributed free-of-charge to all Ugandan households, aiming to achieve universal&#xD;
      coverage. The Against Malaria Foundation has agreed to provide LLINs treated with a&#xD;
      pyrethroid insecticide plus pyriproxyfen (PPF) (Royal Guard, Disease Control Technology) and&#xD;
      LLINs treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) (PermaNet 3.0,&#xD;
      Vestergaard), presenting an opportunity to rigorously evaluate and compare these two LLINs at&#xD;
      scale across Uganda. In collaboration with the MOH, the investigators propose to embed a&#xD;
      cluster-randomised trial to compare the impact of LLINs with PPF to LLINs with PBO into&#xD;
      Uganda's 2020 LLIN distribution campaign. The primary objective of the study is: To evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of LLINs treated with a pyrethroid insecticide plus pyriproxyfen (PPF LLINs), as&#xD;
      compared to LLINs treated with a pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO LLINs), on malaria&#xD;
      incidence in Uganda. The study will test the hypothesis that malaria incidence will be lower&#xD;
      in intervention clusters (randomised to receive PPF LLINs) than in control clusters&#xD;
      (randomised to receive PBO LLINs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This rigorous, cluster-randomised trial will evaluate the impact of long-lasting insecticidal&#xD;
      nets (LLINs) distributed in Uganda through the 2020-21 national universal coverage campaign.&#xD;
      A cluster has been defined as the catchment area of a Malaria Reference Centre (MRC). A total&#xD;
      of 64 clusters have been included in the study, covering 32 high malaria burden districts in&#xD;
      Uganda where IRS is not being implemented. Clusters have been randomised in a 1:1 ratio in&#xD;
      blocks of two by district to receive one of two types of LLINs: (1) pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs&#xD;
      (Royal Guard) [n=32] and (2) piperonyl butoxide (PBO) LLINs (PermaNet 3.0) [n=32].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, including delivery of the LLINs and social and behaviour change&#xD;
      communication (SBCC), will be led by the Ugandan National Malaria Control Division (NMCD) and&#xD;
      other stakeholders. Currently, LLINs are scheduled to be delivered in the study areas from&#xD;
      October 2020 to January 2021. The evaluation will include health facility surveillance at the&#xD;
      MRCs to generate continuous estimates of malaria incidence for each MRC catchment area,&#xD;
      cross-sectional community surveys at baseline (if additional resources are available), and at&#xD;
      12- and 24-months after LLIN distribution to gather information on net survivorship and use,&#xD;
      and parasite prevalence in children 2-10 years of age, entomology surveys, and assessment of&#xD;
      net durability and efficacy. The primary outcome of the trial will be malaria incidence as&#xD;
      estimated using the health facility surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cluster the study will use a 'fried egg' approach for delivering the intervention&#xD;
      ('egg white') and measuring our outcomes ('egg yolk'). The 'white' of the egg will include&#xD;
      one sub-county per cluster, where the MRC is located. PPF LLINs and PBO LLINs will be&#xD;
      distributed to the designated sub-county, as allocated in the randomisation. The 'yolk' of&#xD;
      the egg will be the catchment area directly surrounding each MRC, where care-seeking at the&#xD;
      MRC is expected to be high (i.e. if someone within the catchment area develops malaria, they&#xD;
      are likely to seek care at the MRC). To determine the population of the MRC catchment areas,&#xD;
      and to generate a sampling frame for the community surveys, the investigators will do the&#xD;
      following: (1) define the catchment area of each MRC before the onset of the trial using data&#xD;
      on village of residence from patients attending the MRCs, (2) map and enumerate all&#xD;
      households within the MRC catchment areas before the 12-month community survey, and (3)&#xD;
      conduct a census survey within each MRC catchment area to generate an accurate estimate of&#xD;
      the study population in which study outcomes will be measured concurrently with the 12-month&#xD;
      community survey.&#xD;
