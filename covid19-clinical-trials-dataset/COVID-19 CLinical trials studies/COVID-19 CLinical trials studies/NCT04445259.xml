      The aim is to describe the epidemiology and determine the independent risk factors for&#xD;
      mortality and acute organ injury in AKI and to assess the impact of different treatment&#xD;
      strategies on survival. This will allow the development of prevention strategies and design&#xD;
      of appropriately powered intervention studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China,&#xD;
      over 1 million people have been infected and over 55,000 have died worldwide, and these&#xD;
      numbers continue to rise. Combating this pandemic requires a multidisciplinary approach from&#xD;
      the medical research community, including translational studies to understand the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of disease, randomized controlled trials of novel and re-purposed&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies, and rigorously conducted epidemiologic studies that include granular&#xD;
      patient-level data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge of the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 is mostly limited to&#xD;
      studies from China and Italy. In one of the larger such studies, which consisted of 1099&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in mainland China, only 173 (16%) were classified as having severe&#xD;
      disease, and only 15 (1.4%) died. The study was therefore inadequately powered to determine&#xD;
      independent risk factors for death. A larger study consisting of 72,314 patients was recently&#xD;
      published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This nationwide registry&#xD;
      study identified several important findings, including the striking monotonic relationship&#xD;
      between older age and greater risk of death. Important limitations of the study, however,&#xD;
      were lack of granular patient-level data and relatively few patients (&lt;5% of the cohort) who&#xD;
      were critically ill. Among critically ill patients with COVID-19, acute mortality rates have&#xD;
      been reported to be as high as 49-62%, underscoring the importance of studying this patient&#xD;
      population. Data from the United Kingdom (UK) suggest that &gt;50% of critically ill patients&#xD;
      have a degree of acute kidney injury (AKI) and &gt;20% need renal replacement therapy (RRT).&#xD;
      Mortality is particularly high in those who are mechanically ventilated and need RRT (&gt;75%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information about the risk of AKI, contributing factors and reasons for high&#xD;
      mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients is lacking. To meet this urgent need, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to collect clinical data from &gt;250 critically ill patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Hospital. The investigators&#xD;
      will collaborate with Dr Gupta and Prof Leaf from Harvard Medical School, Boston (US) who are&#xD;
      leading a similar study across &gt;50 sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to describe the epidemiology and determine the independent risk factors for&#xD;
      mortality and acute organ injury in AKI and to assess the impact of different treatment&#xD;
      strategies on survival. This will allow the development of prevention strategies and design&#xD;
      of appropriately powered intervention studies.&#xD;
