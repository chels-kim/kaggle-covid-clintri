  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new coronavirus known as SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus 2)&#xD;
      was first reported in December 2019 and rapidly became a public health emergency. The&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic is now affecting sensitive regions with fragile health care systems, such&#xD;
      as South America and Africa. Caregivers, in the front line of Covid19 patient management, may&#xD;
      accidentally become infected and a source of infection during the incubation phase or in case&#xD;
      of asymptomatic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are thus i) to assess SARS-Cov-2 spread over the hospital&#xD;
      departments of Bamako by carrying out a systematic molecular screening of patients and&#xD;
      caregivers, ii) to evaluate the feasibility of Point-Of-Care molecular assays in Mali and&#xD;
      iii) to estimate the immunity acquired from SARS-Cov-2 among health workers through&#xD;
      serological testing, allowing also the assessment of asymptomatic caregiver rate and absence&#xD;
      of re-infection among the immunized caregivers. Finally, iv) variability of the virus over&#xD;
      time and spread of different variants around the world will be studied by sequencing the&#xD;
      viral genome.&#xD;
