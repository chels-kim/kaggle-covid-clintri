  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itolizumab in&#xD;
      subjects hospitalized with COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will randomize up to 800 subjects in a 1:1 ratio; itolizumab vs. placebo. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive either itolizumab or placebo administered intravenously on Day 1 and Day 8 with&#xD;
      follow-up to Day 90. Two interim analyses of futility are planned. The first will take place&#xD;
      when approximately 20% of the subjects have been evaluated for the primary endpoint, and the&#xD;
      second will take place when approximately 50% of the subjects have been evaluated for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint.&#xD;
