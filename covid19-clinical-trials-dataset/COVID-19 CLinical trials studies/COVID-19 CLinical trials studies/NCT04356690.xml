    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of etoposide in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed with a 3:1 allocation ratio. Treatment will be comprised of etoposide&#xD;
      administered intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection meeting eligibility criteria. Subsequent doses of etoposide will be allowed if the&#xD;
      investigator and treating physician believe the patient had clinical benefit from etoposide&#xD;
      therapy but subsequently has evidence of recurrent clinical deterioration. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to control will receive standard of care treatment. No placebo will be used.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open-label phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of etoposide in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed with a 3:1 allocation ratio. Treatment will be comprised of etoposide&#xD;
      administered intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection meeting eligibility criteria. Subsequent doses of etoposide will be allowed if the&#xD;
      investigator and treating physician believe the patient had clinical benefit from etoposide&#xD;
      therapy but subsequently has evidence of recurrent clinical deterioration. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to control will receive standard of care treatment. No placebo will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the use of etoposide to treat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is the high&#xD;
      mortality associated with the hyperinflammatory response to the virus, which is similar to&#xD;
      that seen in other secondary types of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Autopsy studies of&#xD;
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID patients show a high number of cytolytic&#xD;
      T cells in the lungs of such patients. Early autopsy results of COVID patients at Boston&#xD;
      Medical Center demonstrate significant hemophagocytosis in lymph nodes and spleen. Comparable&#xD;
      studies in the related coronavirus infection severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have&#xD;
      demonstrated hemophagocytosis, a hallmark of HLH.15 By targeting the T cells and monocytes&#xD;
      driving the cytokine storm in patients with the more severe forms of COVID infection, we hope&#xD;
      to alleviate the progression of lung and multi-organ dysfunction characteristic of patients&#xD;
      who die from this illness.&#xD;
