  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageism is common is healthcare workers, and that results in negative outcomes for elderly&#xD;
      patients. This randomized controlled trial is to determine if age bias could be changed by an&#xD;
      online learning activity in undergraduate students in an entry-level nutrition class.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms is to determine the effect of an&#xD;
      online educational intervention developed to reduce ageism in undergraduate students enrolled&#xD;
      in an entry-level Nutrition class. Eligible study participants will be randomized into either&#xD;
      the &quot;Intervention group&quot; (INT) or the &quot;Control group&quot; (CON). The two groups will have&#xD;
      different learning material delivered online via Blackboard (Learning Management System/LMS).&#xD;
      These include a collection of short videos developed by the researchers, as well as relevant&#xD;
      videos available on the web. Participants in the INT group will learn about aging and ageism,&#xD;
      while the CON group will learn about diversity and cultural competence. Sociodemographic&#xD;
      data, percieved risk of COVID-19, preventative behaviors related ot COVID-19 will be&#xD;
      collected using a questionnaire at baseline. Ageism will be assessed using standard&#xD;
      questionnaires. Data collection will be done at three time points: Pre-intervention,&#xD;
      immediate post intervention and 2-weeks post-intervention. Difference between groups for&#xD;
      pre-post intervention changes will be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will go over multiple short videos covering the following content:1). Myths about aging, 2). Ageism and its negative effects, 3). Distorted views about aging among young adults, 4). Ageism during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 5). importance of reducing ageism among healthcare professionals. These will be multiple videos posted on the LMS (Blackboard). At the end of the lesson, they will be asked to briefly write what they learned on Blackboard as an assignment.</description>
