      It was aimed to evaluate the respiratory functions of patients who were hospitalized in&#xD;
      intensive care due to Covid-19 and given respiratory rehabilitation, in-bed positioning, and&#xD;
      early mobilization, and the time of leaving the intensive care unit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the clinical classification of the World Health Organization, COVID-19; It&#xD;
      manifests itself in a wide spectrum, ranging from mild illness, Pneumonia, Severe pneumonia,&#xD;
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to Sepsis and septic shock, resulting in death.&#xD;
      In the presence of acute respiratory failure, a decrease in lung compliance leads to&#xD;
      increased respiratory work, impaired blood oxygenation, and rapid and superficial breathing&#xD;
      patterns. In this case, minimizing inspiratory effort and maximizing the mechanical&#xD;
      efficiency of breathing is the most important approach of treatment. In these clinical&#xD;
      conditions, the strength of the respiratory muscles may also be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge of COVID-19 requires a multidisciplinary approach. Rehabilitative intervention&#xD;
      should be a part of the treatment pathway from the early stages of the disease. There is an&#xD;
      urgent need to build information based on the most effective non-pharmacological measures to&#xD;
      ensure the earliest discharge and best recovery after complex COVID-19 infection. Multimodal&#xD;
      rehabilitation at all stages of the disease should be part of a holistic medical approach,&#xD;
      but there is still no consensus on the timing and type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early physiotherapy in early-onset acute respiratory distress syndrome in the ICU is a&#xD;
      critical therapeutic tool to reduce the complications of immobilization in critical diseases&#xD;
      such as myopathy, neuropathy and ventilator dependence. Benefits include improved residual&#xD;
      respiration, musculoskeletal system, neurological and psychological function; It prevents&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations in the medium and long term, improves health status and improves the&#xD;
      perceived quality of life after discharge. In an acute setting, interventions can also&#xD;
      motivate active recipients to participate in rehabilitation pathways and improve adherence to&#xD;
      treatment after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious cases of COVID-19 are associated with the consequences of respiratory support and&#xD;
      rehabilitation needs related to prolonged immobility and bed rest. These can include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired lung function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical impairment and muscle weakness; Delirium and other cognitive disorders;&#xD;
           Impaired swallowing and communication; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental health disorders and psychosocial support needs. Based on this information, we&#xD;
           aimed to investigate whether respiratory rehabilitation, positioning, normal joint&#xD;
           movement exercises and early mobilization are effective in the treatment of Covid-19.&#xD;

    <description>The Scale was described in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan Jennett (Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness. A practical scale. Lancet 1974; 2:81-4.) as a way to communicate about the level of consciousness of patients with an acute brain injury.</description>

    <measure>APACHE II</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline mMRC Dyspnea Scale at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>APACHE II (&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II&quot;) is a severity-of-disease classification system (Knaus et al., 1985),[1] one of several ICU scoring systems. It is applied within 24 hours of admission of a patient to an intensive care unit (ICU): an integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death.</description>

    <measure>mMRC Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline mMRC Dyspnea Scale at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC Dyspnea Scale quantifies disability attributable to breathlessness, and is useful for characterizing baseline dyspnea in patients with respiratory diseases. Describes baseline dyspnea, but does not accurately quantify response to treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</description>
