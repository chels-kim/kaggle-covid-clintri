      The aim of this study is to investigate the levels of parental stress 3 months after (T2) the&#xD;
      strict physical distancing government initiated physical distancing protocols related to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic (T1). The study also aims to investigate how predictors measured during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic are associated with parental stress 3 months after when the majority of the&#xD;
      protocols are lifted.&#xD;

      Hypothesis/Research Questions H1: There will be a significant decrease in parental stress&#xD;
      from T1 to T2. Exploratory: Investigate the difference in level of parental stress across&#xD;
      different demographic subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Higher level in angry at child, relationship quality and anxiety/depression and less&#xD;
      reduction from T1 to T2 in angry at child and anxiety/depression will be associated with less&#xD;
      reduction in parental stress from T1 to T2, above and beyond gender, age and number of&#xD;
      children in household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a 'The Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence project&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated surveys like the present one typically have a lot of drop out and missing data.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will use mixed models instead of paired t-tests, repeated measures ANOVAs, and&#xD;
      ordinary linear regression to analyze the data. Mixed models use maximum likelihood&#xD;
      estimation, which is the state of the art approach to handle missing data (Schafer &amp; Graham,&#xD;
      2002). Especially if data are missing at random, which is likely in our survey, mixed models&#xD;
      give more unbiased results than the other analytic methods (O'Connel et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary analyses, and for the dependent variables (parental stress) the combination of&#xD;
      random effects and covariance structure of residuals that gives the best fit for the &quot;empty&quot;&#xD;
      model (the model without fixed predictors except the intercept) will be chosen. Akaike's&#xD;
      Information Criterion (AIC) will used to compare the fit of different models. Models that&#xD;
      give a reduction in AIC greater than 2 will be considered better (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2004).&#xD;
      The program SPSS 25.0 will be used (IBM Corp, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, H1 about decrease in parental stress will be tested by using parental stress as&#xD;
      dependent variable in a model using time (T1 period = 0, T2 period = 1) as a predictor.&#xD;
      Second, demographic group variables will be added as predictors. Third, the initial (T1)&#xD;
      levels of angry at child and anxiety/depression will be added, together with the interactions&#xD;
      of these constant covariates with time. Relationship quality during the whole pandemic&#xD;
      period, measured at T2, is considered a constant and is thus included as predictor. These&#xD;
      interactions represent tests of H2 about the covariates predicting change in parental stress.&#xD;
      Finally, the T2 angry at child and anxiety/depression as constant covariates will be added,&#xD;
      together with the interactions of these constant covariates with time. These interactions&#xD;
      represent tests of H2 about the change in the covariates from T1 to T2 predicting change in&#xD;
      parental stress from T1 to T2s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship quality were assessed with three items: 1) From the beginning of the pandemic&#xD;
      have you been more or less satisfied with your relationship? 2) I have had several problems&#xD;
      in the relationship with my spouse, 3) I have developed a closer relationships to my spouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)3. This measure is routinely used to assess symptoms&#xD;
      of depression in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for major depression disorder and&#xD;
      consists of nine items where each is scored on a four-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) was used to obtain symptoms of anxiety and worry,&#xD;
      encompassing seven items scored on a four-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angry at child was measured with a single item Demographics include gender, age, psychiatric&#xD;
      diagnosis and number of children in household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible transformations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be assessed in their original and validated format as is recommended&#xD;
      practice, as long as this is possible with regards to statistical assumptions underlying the&#xD;
      pre-defined analyses (i.e., multiple regression). However, if this is not possible with&#xD;
      regards to the statistical assumptions behind the analyses, transformation (e.g., square root&#xD;
      or log-transformations) may be needed to apply interval-based methods, alternatively the use&#xD;
      of non-parametric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria Given the large sample size in this study, the investigators pre-define&#xD;
      their significance level: p &lt; 0.01 to determine significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size at T1 included 2880 participants. For the present study at T2, all&#xD;
      participants will be invited to participate in accordance with the study plan. The data&#xD;
      collection period will continue for up to three weeks until as many of the participants at&#xD;
      baseline have responded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Questions addressed in the future paper which is not pre-specified will be defined as&#xD;
      exploratory.&#xD;

    <description>The Danish Parental Stress Scale is developed as a short measure of parental stress consisting of nine items. Three items from this scale were chosen by a panel of clinical experts, with the aim of avoiding topological overlap: 1) I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a parent, 2) The major source of stress in my life is my child(ren), and 3) It is difficult to balance different responsibilities because of my child(ren).</description>
