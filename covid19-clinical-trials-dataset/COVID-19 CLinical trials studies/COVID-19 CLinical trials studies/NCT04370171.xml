  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the end of February 2020, Covid-19 infection has spread widely in France, particularly&#xD;
      in the East region, with on March 25th, 2020, 5,479 infected patients and 407 deceased&#xD;
      patients, including 256 in Alsace. Among the hospitalized patients reported in the initial&#xD;
      Chinese studies, 48% had co-morbidity, particularly diabetes or cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Covid-19 infection does not appear to be more common in diabetic patients, but infected&#xD;
      diabetics have more severe forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of diabetes is high in Alsace affecting 6.5% of the population against 4.6% in&#xD;
      France. Du to health containment measures, asymptomatic diabetic patients can no longer come&#xD;
      to the clinic in Hospital for their consultation. However, in the current epidemiological&#xD;
      context, maintaining optimal glycemic control is fundamental since some of diabetic patients&#xD;
      will have Covid-19 infections. Furthermore, the sedentary lifestyle and snacking linked to&#xD;
      the confinement period will contribute to a glycemic imbalance in some patients.&#xD;
      Telemedicine, and in particular teleconsultation, which until now has been very uncommon in&#xD;
      the management of diabetic patients, represents a very interesting alternative for monitoring&#xD;
      these patients and maintaining satisfactory metabolic control during the current period of&#xD;
      confinement and Covid-19 epidemic.&#xD;

    <time_frame>HbA1C measured at 3 months post-telemedicine consultation group / post-cancellation of the face-to-face consultation group (variation versus basal)</time_frame>
    <description>In the Covid 19 epidemic context, the face-to-face consultation of diabetic patients with the hospital's physician or their diabetologist is / will be replaced by a teleconsultation ( phone or computer consultation) followed at 6 months of a face-to-face consultation. Patients will be monitored in accordance with routine practice.&#xD;
The Teleconsultation (TC) group will be composed of patients for whom the consultation initially scheduled in the presence of the diabetologist has been replaced by a teleconsultation due to the availability of diabetologists whose activity is focused on the management of Covid-19 negative patients.&#xD;
The Face-to-Face group will be composed of patients for whom the consultation initially scheduled in the presence of the diabetologist was postponed by 6 months due to the activity of some diabetologists entirely redirected towards the management of Covid-19 positive patients.</description>
