      The 2019-20 coronavirus disease, caused by COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic.So far, no&#xD;
      specific treatment has proven efficacy. Recent case series reported the use of Hyperbaric&#xD;
      Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) on 5 severe COVID-19 patients who developed respiratory insufficiency.&#xD;
      HBOT mechanisms of tissue oxygenation and anti-inflammatory effect may explain these&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

      The purpose of the current study is the evaluate the efficacy of HBOT in moderate-severe&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2019-20 coronavirus disease, caused by COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic. The outbreak&#xD;
      started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Up to Apr 9. 2020 there are more than 2&#xD;
      million confirmed cases, and over 140,000 deaths. In Israel, COVID-19 was confirmed in more&#xD;
      12,000 cases and took the life of 140 victims. There are 323 mild admitted cases, 170&#xD;
      moderate admitted cases and 170 severe admitted cases (16.04.2020) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the general mortality rate is low (0.2-7%, country based), patients who develop&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have a significantly higher mortality rate, up to&#xD;
      61-90%. COVID-19 ARDS is different, causing a rapidly progressive disease including&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism behind isn't clear yet, but&#xD;
      evidence points to the direction of an acute cytokines storm which include: IL-2, IL-7, GCSF,&#xD;
      InterferonGamma, TNF-alpha, Macrophage chemoattractant protein . Poor prognosis include high&#xD;
      levels of IL-6 and Ferritin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 160 clinical trials have been registered, but as of April 2020, there is no proven&#xD;
      effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes breathing 100% oxygen in pressures&#xD;
      higher than 1 absolute atmospheres (ATA), increasing the amount of oxygen dissolved in the&#xD;
      plasma and the different tissues. In the last month, Chen et al. reported a case series of 5&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 patients treated with 3-8 HBOT sessions in addition to the standard therapy.&#xD;
      In all cases, they reported an increase in oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen content,lactate&#xD;
      levels reduction,fibrinogen levels decrease and increase in lymphocytes number.In addition,&#xD;
      the patients chest CT showed improved signs. Symptomatic relief started following the 2nd&#xD;
      session. No significant adverse events were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings may be explained by the known physiological effects of HBOT, related to the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus pathogenesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increased competitive binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin molecule - it has been&#xD;
           postulated recently the SARS-CoV-2 bind to the heme component in the hemoglobin molecule&#xD;
           and reduces the oxygen affinity to hemoglobin. During HBOT, the increased amount of&#xD;
           available oxygen molecules increases the binding to the hemoglobin molecules. This has&#xD;
           shown significant beneficial effects in cases of another competitive molecule such as&#xD;
           carbon monoxide intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tissue oxygenation - The oxygen content in the different tissues is multiplied by 25-30&#xD;
           times. This effect has two therapeutic aspects: First, overcoming pulmonary hypoxia&#xD;
           (either shunt or VQ mismatch) by increasing the FiO2 significantly. By increasing the&#xD;
           pulmonary oxygen gradient, oxygen diffusion increases and can overcome the inflammation&#xD;
           in the alveoli and the thickened fibrosis caused by ARDS. Second, during HBOT, the&#xD;
           amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma becomes significant and enables tissue&#xD;
           oxygenation without the need of red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anti inflammatory - HBOT reduces the following inflammatory cytokines both in the&#xD;
           protein level and genes expression (mRNA): IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta. The&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory effect has been shown in chronic diseases as well as models of acute&#xD;
           infection and massive hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is the evaluate the efficacy of HBOT in moderate-severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients in a randomized controlled manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the national IRB requirements the protocol includes 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase includes 5 patients who following signing an informed consent will be treated&#xD;
      with 8 sessions of HBOT , 2 sessions per day, in 4 consecutive days. During the sessions, the&#xD;
      symptoms and vitals will be monitored. 1 day following the last session, revaluation will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase will include 24 patients, who following signing an informed consent, will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 to hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and standard of care control group.&#xD;
      Following the randomization the patients will undergo baseline evaluation including symptoms,&#xD;
      vitals, pulmonary function and blood tests The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure&#xD;
      (PaO2 in mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen at 5 days after enrollment was determined as the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the study. However, the ability to draw arterial blood gases with full&#xD;
      COVID-19 protection gear was found to be challenging, more than usual inconvenient to the&#xD;
      patients and many of the patients asked to avoid it (especially the draw of second arterial&#xD;
      blood gas). Therefore, this endpoint was not completed and changed from the original&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The HBOT group patients will undergo 8 sessions of either hyperbaric oxygen therapy, 2&#xD;
      sessions per day, in 4 consecutive days. During the sessions, the symptoms and vitals will be&#xD;
      monitored. 1 day following the last session, revaluation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will continue standard of care and undergo similar vitals and symptoms&#xD;
      monitoring. 5 days after baseline evaluation, revaluation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long 30 days outcomes of both groups will be collected.&#xD;
