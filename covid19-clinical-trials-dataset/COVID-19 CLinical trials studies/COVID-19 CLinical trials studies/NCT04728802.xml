  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a&#xD;
      significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42%&#xD;
      vs 58%). Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be&#xD;
      extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including&#xD;
      cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in&#xD;
      severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and&#xD;
      COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant&#xD;
      variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters&#xD;
      pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral&#xD;
      spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro.Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of&#xD;
      influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the&#xD;
      only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen&#xD;
      receptor. Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is&#xD;
      affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the investigators have reported the results from two retrospective cohort&#xD;
      analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARi) for men&#xD;
      with COVID-19. In a study of 77 men hospitalized with COVID-19 the investigators found among&#xD;
      men taking 5ARis, 8% were admitted to the ICU compared to 58% of men not taking 5ARis (P =&#xD;
      0.0015). In the cohort, 5ARis were associated with reduced risk for ICU admissions RR 0.14&#xD;
      (95% CI: 0.02-0.94).Similarly, the investigators have demonstrated that the frequency of&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptoms was drastically reduced for men using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. A&#xD;
      statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) reduction in the frequency of 20 of the 29 clinical&#xD;
      symptoms was observed in AGA men using 5ARis compared to AGA men not using 5ARis. For&#xD;
      example, 38% and 2% of men presented with low-grade fever, 60% and 6% with dry cough, and 88%&#xD;
      and 15% reported anosmia in the non-5ARi and 5ARi groups, respectively.18&#xD;
&#xD;
      One limitation of 5ARis is the time course required to achieve systemic DHT reductions. As&#xD;
      such, the investigators explored the use of a novel second generation androgen receptor&#xD;
      antagonist Proxalutamide as a means for rapid reduction in AR activity. Proxalutamide&#xD;
      (GT0918) demonstrates a dual mechanism of action. It is highly effective in inhibiting AR as&#xD;
      well as exhibiting pharmacological effects of inducing the down-regulation of AR expression;&#xD;
      the mechanism that is not present in bicalutamide and enzalutamide. Because of the dual&#xD;
      mechanism of action, it is expected to be a more effective and less toxic second-generation&#xD;
      anti-androgen drug therapy. Clinical evidence has demonstrated that Proxalutamide lowers AR&#xD;
      expression and activity. Additionally, it has been reported that Proxalutamide lowers the&#xD;
      expression of ACE2. Both would be beneficial for preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells.&#xD;
      In addition, none of the 5ARis currently approved by the US FDA have been tested in phase I&#xD;
      studies in women. As such, thet are not recommended for women. Phase I studies for&#xD;
      Proxalutamide have been successfully completed in both men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2020, the investigators completed a double-blinded, randomized, prospective,&#xD;
      investigational study of Proxalutamide Treatment for Non-Hospitalized COVID-19 Male Patients&#xD;
      (NCT04446429). The length of the study was 30 days. Proxalutamide was administered 200mg q.d.&#xD;
      for 15 days. Men enrolled in the study were 50 years and older. Two hundred and sixty two men&#xD;
      completed the study. 134 men were assigned to the Proxalutamide group and 128 men were&#xD;
      assigned to the control group. Thirty five subjects were hospitalized in the control group&#xD;
      compared to zero in the Proxalutamide group. The proportion of COVID-19 patients hospitalized&#xD;
      was significantly different between the Proxalutamide and control arms; χ2 (1) = 42.051,&#xD;
      p&lt;.0001. The difference in proportions was 27.30% with a 95%CI: [19.79%, 35.59%]. No subject&#xD;
      receiving Proxalutamide died compared to 2 (1.56%) in the control group. There were no&#xD;
      treatment related adverse event reported during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the Proxalutamide Treatment for Non-Hospitalized COVID-19 Male&#xD;
      Patients study (NCT04446429), the purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Proxalutamide as a treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 male and female patients.&#xD;

                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment ;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable for a minimum&#xD;
                  of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women are considered post-menopausal&#xD;
                  and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
                  (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
                  ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the&#xD;
                  woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment, is she considered&#xD;
                  not of child bearing potential;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and&#xD;
             for 3 months after stopping GT0918 treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject likely to transfer to another hospital within the next 28 days&#xD;
