      This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observer-blind study in healthy&#xD;
      Japanese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      vaccine candidate against COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As 2 doses, separated by 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At a single dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In adults 20 to 85 years of age&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, vaccination&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy participants who are determined by medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
             clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving personal signed informed consent.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the study intervention(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of medications intended to prevent COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised individuals with known or suspected immunodeficiency, as determined&#xD;
             by history and/or laboratory/physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding that would, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, contraindicate intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination with any coronavirus vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who receive treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic&#xD;
             agents or systemic corticosteroids, eg, for cancer or an autoimmune disease, or&#xD;
             planned receipt throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulin, from 60 days before study&#xD;
             intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other studies involving study intervention within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry and/or during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in other studies involving study intervention containing lipid&#xD;
             nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subset only: Any screening hematology and/or blood chemistry laboratory value that&#xD;
             meets the definition of a ≥ Grade 1 abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator site staff or Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the&#xD;
             study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective&#xD;
