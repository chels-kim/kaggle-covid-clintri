      Sample Size: n=570&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Ceiling: n=627&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients age 18 to 100 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Period: January 1 2021 to December 5, 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Start Date: January 1, 2021 End Date: December 5, 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration includes 12 months to recruit patients and 12 months of total follow-up&#xD;
      time counted from the first day of COVID-19 symptoms or date of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate the short- and&#xD;
      long-term end-organ complications of COVID-19 and to establish a COVID-19 biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who had previous asymptomatic COVID-19 (n=40)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who had previous mild COVID-19 (mild=never required supplemental oxygen during&#xD;
           the acute phase of the infection) (n=90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who had previous moderate/severe COVID-19 (moderate=required supplemental&#xD;
           oxygen by nasal cannula during the acute phase of the infection; severe=required&#xD;
           supplemental oxygen by either high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive positive pressure&#xD;
           ventilation or intubation [n=120])&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who have not had COVID-19 (i.e. household contacts of COVID-19 cases [n=30])&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the short- and long-term end-organ complications post-COVID-19 in relation to&#xD;
           the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish a post-COVID-19 biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Develop a model based that may predict the development of end-organ complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of any end-organ complication that can plausibly be related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any change in cardiac ejection fraction (EF) post-COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detection of any new abnormality on pulmonary function testing (PFT) or any change in&#xD;
           PFT compared to a pre- or post-COVID-19 baseline PFT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any increase (beyond the upper limit of normal) in serum creatinine that is not&#xD;
           secondary to a urinary tract infection, or a pre- or post-renal process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An increase in liver enzymes &gt; 3X upper limit of normal that occurs post-COVID-19 and is&#xD;
           not associated to any other process (e.g. cholestasis, drug toxicity, alcohol abuse,&#xD;
           hepatitis A, B, C, D, E).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Any change in pre-COVID-19 weight, waist circumference or % fat mass that is not due to&#xD;
           a change in diet or activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any change in blood glucose, glucose tolerance testing, continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
           (CGM), HgA1C, lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3/T4, cortisol from&#xD;
           pre-COVID that persists during the mid- and/or late recovery phase or that occurs post&#xD;
           COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A positive fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin measurement during any of the COVID-19&#xD;
           recovery phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Any significant change in renal parameters (micro-albuminuria, creatinine, glomerular&#xD;
           filtration rate [GFR]) in any of the COVID-19 recovery phases compared to pre-COVID-19&#xD;
           or between 2 different recovery phase evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Any change in food habits (nutritional quantity and quality) as measured by the Food&#xD;
           Frequency Questionnaire, in physical activity as measured by pedometer reading, and/or&#xD;
           well-being as measured by our Well-Being Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (for more than 28 days) will have 3 to 4 medical visits&#xD;
      depending on the time since diagnosis (1 year post-diagnosis). Control patients will have 3&#xD;
      medical visits. The data will be collected for clinical monitoring and banking purposes&#xD;
      (biobank). Medical visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool collection (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasopharyngeal swab and nasal curettage (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Well-being questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food frequency questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interval clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam (if indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight and height measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impedance / evaluation of body mass composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pedometer reading (worn for 7 days continuously)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous glucose monitoring (monitor worn for 14 days continuously; FreeStyle Libre&#xD;
           Pro, Abbott)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary function test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography and electrocardiogram&#xD;
