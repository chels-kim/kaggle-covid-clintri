    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of zotatifin administered IV to adults with mild or moderate COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive zotatifin or placebo in 3 cohorts of 12 patients each.&#xD;
      Cohorts will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher zotatifin dose levels. Study&#xD;
      drug will not be administered to patients who are hospitalized. The second dose of study drug&#xD;
      will not be administered should a patient progress from mild or moderate COVID-19 to severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 prior to or on Day 8. Patients will assess and record their symptoms daily through&#xD;
      Day 22 and at follow up (30 days after last infusion) (or at the early termination visit [if&#xD;
      conducted]) in a paper patient diary using the WHO 9-point ordinal scale for clinical&#xD;
      improvement. Other safety and efficacy measures will be assessed according to the Schedule of&#xD;
      Procedures on Days 1, 4, 8, 10, 15 (end of treatment visit), and 22, and at follow up (30&#xD;
      days after last infusion). On non-dosing days, study visits will be conducted as home health&#xD;
      visits, except for the follow-up visit, which will be conducted as a telephone visit.&#xD;
