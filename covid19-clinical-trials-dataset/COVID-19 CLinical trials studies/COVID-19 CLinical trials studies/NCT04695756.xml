  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic together with the strategies that are applied to control it are&#xD;
      generating high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its impact on health systems is worrisome,&#xD;
      affecting all the population, even those who are not infected or at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the access to the medical care of patients on&#xD;
      the waiting list for organ transplantation might be multifactorial, including the need to&#xD;
      relocate health-related resources (medical personnel, supplies, critical care unit beds,&#xD;
      etc), the risk of COVID-19 transmission among donors or patients on the waiting list, and&#xD;
      also after transplantation. Additionally, the pandemic reduces significantly the donor pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consider that it is important to assess the impact that the pandemic has in particular&#xD;
      individual populations, such as in patients requiring a liver transplant. Along with the&#xD;
      lockdown, the rate of organ donation has dropped, and liver transplant programs across the&#xD;
      world have reduced or suspended their activity. Unfortunately, this is invariably associated&#xD;
      with an increase in mortality on the waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the impact of the pandemic on patients who require a liver transplant will provide&#xD;
      tools to understand and plan the health resources related to the care of these patients, not&#xD;
      only at present but also in the following years.&#xD;

      only at present but also in the following years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      To Compare the following outcomes in patients requiring liver transplantation during the&#xD;
      epidemiological weeks of COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina and the same weeks of 2019 according&#xD;
      to national data registry of procurement and transplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of patients registered on the liver transplant waiting list&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of deaths on the liver transplant waiting list&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of liver transplants&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we will carry out a time series analyses using the national data registry&#xD;
      of procurement and transplantation database. The effect of both periods will be analysed as&#xD;
      time interrupted series, which is a quasi-experimental design. The following two periods will&#xD;
      be compared as segments of the interrupted time series:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline period (Period not exposed to the pandemic represented by the same&#xD;
           epidemiological weeks of 2019 )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pandemic period COVID-19. (Period between the epidemiological weeks of 2020 affected by&#xD;
           the pandemic declared by the WHO from 11/March/2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of analysis will be the epidemiological weeks, and the study population will be all&#xD;
      Argentinian over 17 years of age. Regarding patients who require liver transplantation, those&#xD;
      who registered for isolated liver transplantation in the National Procurement and Transplant&#xD;
      Institute will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Poisson regression model will be used to assess the association between the period and the&#xD;
      incidence of the events of interest. ARIMA models will be used following the 4 steps proposed&#xD;
      by Box and Jenkings&#xD;
