  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-centre study where hospitalized subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) in addition to standard of care&#xD;
      or standard of care only for 28 days following confirmation of a COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this randomized study will be to evaluate the effect of Isoquercetin&#xD;
      (IQC-950AN) treatment on disease progression (defined as ≥ 6 on the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) clinical progression scale) when given to subjects with confirmed COVID-19 in addition&#xD;
      to standard of care. The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) treatment on the reduction of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) viral titers in these subjects and their recovery. In addition, certain&#xD;
      parameters which may help elucidate the mechanism of action (sLDLR, PCSK9, sACE2, D-dimers&#xD;
      and CRP) will be followed. The safety of Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) will be evaluated at each&#xD;
      visit. Subjects will be randomized to receive treatment for 28 days and then will return 30&#xD;
      days following the discontinuation of treatment for a final safety visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be used to design an adequately powered randomized controlled&#xD;
      pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) in all or a&#xD;
      subset of subjects with confirmed COVID-19.&#xD;
