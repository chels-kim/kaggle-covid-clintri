  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric condition. On the nutritional level, one of the&#xD;
      objectives recommended by the High Authority of Health is to &quot;achieve and maintain an&#xD;
      appropriate weight and nutritional status&quot;. It is recommended that, in the event of&#xD;
      hospitalisation, this should be &quot;as long as necessary&quot; and be based on a weight contract as a&#xD;
      condition for discharge. Within the Pôle Universitaire de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de&#xD;
      l'Adolescent of the Centre Psychothérapique de Nancy, an inpatient unit takes care of&#xD;
      children and adolescents with a specific valence in the management of patients suffering from&#xD;
      eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first quarter of 2020, France has been progressively affected by the pandemic of&#xD;
      the coronavirus 2019, Covid-19. This pandemic has led to unprecedented containment measures&#xD;
      in France and around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the announcement of the implementation of containment, the investigators&#xD;
      proposed to the parents of patients hospitalized in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&#xD;
      Department of the Nancy Psychotherapy Center who were approaching their discharge weight to&#xD;
      be able to end their hospitalization prematurely. As a follow-up to this hospitalisation,&#xD;
      intensive outpatient care was offered to the families, in accordance with State&#xD;
      recommendations in connection with the pandemic. In this hospitalized unit, weekly outpatient&#xD;
      consultations were maintained and coupled with telephone interviews, teleconsultation&#xD;
      interviews and a telephone hotline for the healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to explore, in a qualitative way, the experiences of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in the child psychiatry department for anorexia nervosa at the time of the&#xD;
      coronavirus epidemic in France and those of their parents, in relation to the reorganization&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;

      Interviews will be recorded, made anonymous and transcribed verbatim. The resulting text will&#xD;
      be subjected to an inductive thematic analysis. The investigators will analyse the interviews&#xD;
      to identify themes. Then, based on the preliminary results, higher key themes will be&#xD;
      proposed, i.e. the themes most present and salient in the material. They will look for a&#xD;
      concordance between the different members of each family. Several profiles may be proposed&#xD;
      based on the patient's and parents' experiences and will be presented in the form of a&#xD;
      thematic tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be proposed to all eligible patients in order to obtain as much material as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;

        The source population represents six patients, aged 9 to 17 years in March 2020 and their&#xD;
        parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Four of the six patients went home on the day the lockdown measures were announced, one&#xD;
        patient went home three days later so that her parents would be available, and one patient&#xD;
        remained in hospital because of a physical condition incompatible with a return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The population is therefore made up of 18 people: patients (6) and their parents (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        It will be possible to interview the parent(s) without interviewing the child if the child&#xD;
        refuses to participate in the study.&#xD;
