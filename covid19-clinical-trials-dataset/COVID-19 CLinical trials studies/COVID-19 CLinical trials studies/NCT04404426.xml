  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory involvement of SARS-CoV2 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and&#xD;
      significant immunosuppression (lymphopenia) exposing patients to long ventilation duration&#xD;
      and late mortality linked to the acquisition of nosocomial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphopenia characteristic of severe forms of ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection may be&#xD;
      linked to expansion of MDSCs and arginine depletion of lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonitis are marked by persistent ARDS with acquisition of&#xD;
      nosocomial infections as well as by prolonged lymphocytic dysfunction associated with the&#xD;
      emergence of MDSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found in intensive care patients hypoargininaemia, associated with the&#xD;
      persistence of organ dysfunction (evaluated by the SOFA score), the occurrence of nosocomial&#xD;
      infections and mortality. Also, it has been demonstrated that in these patients, the enteral&#xD;
      administration of ARG was not deleterious and increased the synthesis of ornithine,&#xD;
      suggesting a preferential use of ARG by the arginase route, without significant increase in&#xD;
      argininaemia nor effect on immune functions. L-citrulline (CIT), an endogenous precursor of&#xD;
      ARG, is an interesting alternative to increase the availability of ARG. Recent data&#xD;
      demonstrate that the administration of CIT in intensive care is not deleterious and that it&#xD;
      very significantly reduces mortality in an animal model of sepsis, corrects hypoargininemia,&#xD;
      with convincing data on immunological parameters such as lymphopenia, which is associated&#xD;
      with mortality, organ dysfunction and the occurrence of nosocomial infections. The&#xD;
      availability of ARG directly impacts the mitochondrial metabolism of T lymphocytes and their&#xD;
      function. The hypothesis is therefore that CIT supplementation is more effective than the&#xD;
      administration of ARG to correct hypoargininaemia, decrease lymphocyte dysfunction, correct&#xD;
      immunosuppression and organ dysfunction in septic patients admitted to intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to show that, in patients hospitalized in intensive care for ARDS&#xD;
      secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia, the group of patients receiving L-citrulline for 7 days,&#xD;
      compared to the group receiving placebo, has a score of organ failure decreased on D7&#xD;
      (evaluated by the SOFA score) or by the last known SOFA score if the patient has died or been&#xD;
      resuscitated.&#xD;
