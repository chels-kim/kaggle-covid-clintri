  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and clinical efficacy of low-dose naltrexone in reducing the proportion of&#xD;
      higher risk patients who progress from mild COVID-19 to a more severe disease category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female participants with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test at&#xD;
      screening, who are symptomatic with mild COVID-19 (as measured by WHO clinical progression&#xD;
      scale, WHOb 2020) and are at high risk for COVID-19 progression will be enrolled. High risk&#xD;
      is based on presence of one or more criteria which could include age ≥65 years, increased BMI&#xD;
      ≥33 kg/m2, or the presence of certain comorbidities (refer to Section 4 for complete&#xD;
      eligibility criteria).&#xD;
