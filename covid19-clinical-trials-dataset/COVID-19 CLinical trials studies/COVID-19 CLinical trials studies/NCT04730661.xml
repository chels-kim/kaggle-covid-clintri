  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, the hospital care&#xD;
      system is facing a major strain. Patients with SARS-Cov2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 ) infection can worsen very quickly, possibly presenting, within hours, severe&#xD;
      respiratory failure requiring urgent specialized care. Therefore, it is essential to develop&#xD;
      emergency assessment tools to assess relevant criteria to decide which patients must be kept&#xD;
      under hospital monitoring and which patients can be treated on outpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of STST in the decision to hospitalize&#xD;
      patients consulting emergency department for a SARS-Cov2 infection. The investigators wish to&#xD;
      show that the addition of this test to the usual hospitalization criteria reduces the&#xD;
      proportion of patients hospitalized 48 hours after their first visit to the emergency&#xD;
      department.&#xD;

    <description>The sit to stand test (or STST) is a test consisting of performing as many sit-to-stand tests as possible in one minute, from a chair without armrests.&#xD;
We note before and during this test, the SpO2 (pulsed oxygen saturation) (rest value and minimum value during exercise), heart rate (HR), dyspnea on the modified Borg scale as well as the number of chair lifts performed. completely and minimum SpO2 during the recovery phase.&#xD;
The possible results from this one-minute test are as follows:&#xD;
If SpO2 &lt;90% or appearance of signs of respiratory distress: Immediate stop of the test and hospitalization&#xD;
SpO2 &lt;90% or decrease in SpO2 ≥ 4% during the test or during the recovery period: Hospitalization&#xD;
SpO2 ≥90% and no decrease in SpO2 ≥ 4% during the test or during the recovery period which will be 3 minutes maximum: discharge.</description>
