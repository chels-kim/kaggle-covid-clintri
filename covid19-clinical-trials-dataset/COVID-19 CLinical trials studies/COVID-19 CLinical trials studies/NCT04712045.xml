  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve the personal protective equipment (PPE) used while treating&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19, to protect staff and avoid cross-infection of patients. Protecting&#xD;
      staff from infection during the Covid pandemic is critical to maintaining health services.&#xD;
      Mistakes in using protective equipment (PPE) are the commonest avoidable factor in staff&#xD;
      becoming infected at work. Recently, intensive care doctors have also reported an increase in&#xD;
      the spread of dangerous multi-resistant bacteria between patients, which appears likely to be&#xD;
      transmitted between patients by Level 2 PPE worn by staff (specifically gown sleeves). This&#xD;
      study therefore seeks to develop and test a new protocol to decrease cross-infection risks&#xD;
      whilst using Level 2 PPE.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the proportion of participants and simulated patients who were contaminated with fluorescent powder as examined under a UV light, using a response of &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;, when participants wore new (experimental) Level 2 PPE in comparison to the standard (control) Level 2 PPE</description>

    <description>We will measure the participants' perception of personal comfort and safety and the safety of the patient when wearing experimental versus control Level 2 PPE, during simulation tasks, using a 10 point Likert scale response to a structured questionnaire</description>

    <description>We will measure changes in participants perception of their personal comfort and safety and the safety of patients when wearing each type of PPE using a semi-structured interview (a) before the PPE training, (b) after the PPE training, and (c) after the simulation training exercises.</description>

    <description>we will perform a quantitative analysis of the area of contamination of participants and simulated patients and assess the difference between when participants wore new (experimental) Level 2 PPE and the standard (control) Level 2 PPE, using pre-coded functions with python script.</description>
