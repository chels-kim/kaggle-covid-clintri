    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this pilot study protocol are to assess safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      using the geko™ device in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding safety to patients, we will measure the rate of adverse events, primarily local&#xD;
      site irritation or discomfort. Feasibility will be measured on the basis of recruitment;&#xD;
      ability to enroll sufficient number of patients meeting criteria. Protocol adherence will be&#xD;
      observed as the ability to deliver the study intervention to the patients randomized to the&#xD;
      treatment arm within the prescribed timeline and ability to complete the course of treatment.&#xD;
      Additionally, we plan to measure patient outcomes such as ICU admission and death. The&#xD;
      findings of this study have the potential to decrease the complications seen in COVID-19&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On March 11, 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization. A novel&#xD;
      coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as&#xD;
      the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly become one of the&#xD;
      fastest growing and deadliest diseases to surface due to its high death rate and ability to&#xD;
      replicate and spread readily from people without symptoms. Recent evidence indicates that&#xD;
      critically ill patients with COVID-19 experience a high risk of blood clots. Deep leg vein&#xD;
      blood clots can travel to the lungs and cause severe lung failure and death. The geko™ device&#xD;
      is a simple device that increases the return of blood flow from the lower legs and&#xD;
      potentially decrease the risk of lung blood clots. Investigators believe the geko™ device may&#xD;
      have an important benefit in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the risk of lung clots and&#xD;
      decrease the risk of respiratory failure which is often the cause of death in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. In this study, Investigators plan to study the effect of using the geko™ device in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients and measure patient outcomes such as ICU admission and death. The findings&#xD;
      of this study have the potential to decrease the complications seen in COVID-19 infections.&#xD;
