    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to develop expert consensus statements on infection control management&#xD;
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has grown exponentially in last few months with numerous patients&#xD;
      requiring respiratory support and ICU admissions. The rapidly increasing number of infectious&#xD;
      patients in ICU requires robust infection control management in order to prevent&#xD;
      cross-transmission of virus to other patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). The understanding&#xD;
      on epidemiology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) is still evolving and evidence on transmission of SARS-COV-2 in controlled&#xD;
      healthcare-setting is either absent or conflicting. The main mode of transmission for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is through droplets or fomite. The respiratory support interventions for these&#xD;
      patients in ICU like non-invasive ventilation, high flow nasal oxygen, or tracheal intubation&#xD;
      are aerosol generating procedures and may lead to airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The&#xD;
      viral shedding from serious and critical patients of COVID-19 is also known to be longer than&#xD;
      mild and moderate illness. In absence of robust evidence, there is either conflicting or no&#xD;
      recommendations available from international regulatory agencies on infection control&#xD;
      management of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to use a modified Delphi based methodology involving global&#xD;
      participating experts on infectious disease, intensive care and infection control. The&#xD;
      objective is to achieve consensus statements on the infection control management of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole process of this study will be done in the form of three-four rounds of Google&#xD;
      Forms-based Delphi surveys. The survey questionnaire, will be prepared by the investigators&#xD;
      after systematic search of available literature and concern areas in the infection control of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in ICU. The survey questionnaire will be divided into five sections: 1. Design and&#xD;
      engineering 2. Health-care workers 3. Personal protective equipment 4. Aerosol generating&#xD;
      procedures 5. Disinfection and sterilisation. The majority of these questionnaire statements&#xD;
      are to be rated on Likert scale and others have multiple choices. The participating experts&#xD;
      comments and feedback will be collected through comment section after each question in round&#xD;
      one. All the subsequent surveys will be iterative and the experts can give their opinion in&#xD;
      each round using either open text or directly to steering group of investigators.&#xD;
