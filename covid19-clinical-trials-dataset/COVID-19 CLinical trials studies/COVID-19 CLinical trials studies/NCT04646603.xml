      The Study is Designed as A Combined Phase I Double-Blind Randomized Placebo controlled Study&#xD;
      in Healthy Subjects /Phase IIa, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Multi-center&#xD;
      Study in Subjects Infected with SARS CoV-2 to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy of MRG-001&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To determine the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) profiles of MRG-001 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: To determine the safety and efficacy profile of MRG-001 in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe COVID-19. A total of 138 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive MRG-001 or placebo. All subjects will be treated with the best available&#xD;
      treatment. The follow-up period is up to 28 days.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MRG-001 is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug, administered as a single subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injection. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of these 2 APIs in&#xD;
      mobilizing and recruiting stem cells/immunoregulatory cells and promoting tissue regeneration&#xD;
      in a wide variety of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRG-001 is likely to target multiple aspects of the COVID-19. MRG-001 exhibits&#xD;
      immunoregulatory and regenerative properties in preclinical studies with a wide variety of&#xD;
      diseases. Repairing damaged tissues in the lung and other organs, restoring the anti-virus&#xD;
      immune system and modulating the inflammation are obvious therapeutic targets for COVID-19.&#xD;
      The combined phase I/IIa trial will involve 138 patients randomized into blinded placebo and&#xD;
      MRG-001 arms, to determine the safety and efficacy profile of MRG-001 as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
