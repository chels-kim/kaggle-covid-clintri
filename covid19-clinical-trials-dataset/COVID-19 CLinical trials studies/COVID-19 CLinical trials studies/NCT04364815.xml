  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This COVID-19 pandemic warrants urgent strategies to protect people at high risk of&#xD;
      infection, particularly the healthcare workers. Secondary prevention through post-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PEP) and early treatment of infection are needed to prevent severe cases and cut&#xD;
      secondary transmission. Hydroxycholoroquine (HCQ) is an inexpensive anti-malarial drug with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects that are currently used as an off-label treatment for symptomatic&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. In vitro studies have shown that it can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection and has potential as a post-exposure prophylaxis drug.&#xD;

      To compare the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine with an oral loading dose of 400 mg&#xD;
      two times a day on D1 followed by 400mg/day from Day 2-10 plus standard preventive measures&#xD;
      and standard preventive measures alone as post-exposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers in&#xD;
