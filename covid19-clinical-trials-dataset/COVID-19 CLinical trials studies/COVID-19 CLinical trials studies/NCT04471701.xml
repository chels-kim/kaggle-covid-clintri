  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that started in&#xD;
      late December 2019 in the Hubei province of China caused millions of cases worldwide in just&#xD;
      a few months, and evolved into a real pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only approximately 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients required intensive on&#xD;
      sub-intensice medical care and the remained experience mild or subclinical form of the&#xD;
      disease that did not require hospital admission and a relatively high percentage (40 to 45%)&#xD;
      remained asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-like infectious in a large non-hospitalized&#xD;
      population, when the epidemic peak was occurring in Italy, is of paramount importance but&#xD;
      data are scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research project is to estimate the number of suspected cases of COVID-19&#xD;
      and to investigate the role of the potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in&#xD;
      a large Italian sample of respondents living in Italy during the lockdown (started in Italy&#xD;
      on 9 March 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPICOVID19 is an Italian countrywide self-administered cross-sectional web-based survey on&#xD;
      adult volunteers launched on April 13, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-line questionnaire has been developed starting from the available literature and&#xD;
      implemented using an open source platform focusing on beahvioural and clinical features of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat worldwide, which have been&#xD;
      experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the epidemic peak, epidemiological surveillance strategies were mainly based on the&#xD;
      testing of symptomatic patients with serious diseases requiring hospitalization and intensive&#xD;
      or sub-intensive medical care. This has underestimated the real spread of the infection in&#xD;
      the mild symptomatic (paucisymptomatic) or asymptomatic individuals or in specific group of&#xD;
      persons with limited access to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPICOVID19 was developed and launched to accomplish the following objectives: i) to estimate&#xD;
      the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 in the general population, and ii) to investigate&#xD;
      the role of the potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult volunteers&#xD;
      living in Italy during the lockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPICOVID19 is a national Italian anonymous self-administered internet-based survey that was&#xD;
      carried out using a cross-sectional research design in a convenience sample of adult&#xD;
      volunteers (18+ years old) living in Italy during the lockdown. The survey was launched on 13&#xD;
      April 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to enrol as many subjects as possible, the link to the electronic survey was&#xD;
      uploaded, shared and disseminated via several channels: e-mails, social media platforms&#xD;
      (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp), press releases, internet pages, local radio and TV&#xD;
      stations, and institutional websites that called upon volunteers to contact the study website&#xD;
      https://epicovid19.itb.cnr.it/.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EPICOVID19 study was established as a collaboration of a working work including&#xD;
      epidemiologists, clinicians, biostatisticians, and public health professionals to improve&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-related knowledge. The steering group tested the survey for a period of 2 weeks&#xD;
      before starting to share the public link to the general population on April 13, 2020. The&#xD;
      participants are asked to complete the self-administered 38-item questionnaire, which&#xD;
      contained mainly mandatory and closed questions that is divided into six sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPICOVID19 was designed by the steering group after a literature review of existing research&#xD;
      into COVID-19. To guarantee the maximal comparability to other large epidemiological studies,&#xD;
      several questions was chosen based on standardized and validated questionnaires. The survey&#xD;
      was adapted to the national context and implemented using the European Commission's&#xD;
      open-source official EUSurvey management tool (https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey includes an introductory page briefly describing the rational and the aims of the&#xD;
      study, the consortium, and the option to provide or not the consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first section of the questionnaire investigates the socio-demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      the respondents: sex at birth, birth year, ethnicity, user's postal code and municipality of&#xD;
      residence, educational level, employment status, and current (or last) occupation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second section of the questionnaire investigates the clinical features: SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection-like symptoms and the month of onset of the first symptoms, pre-existing diseases,&#xD;
      other conditions to refer, vaccines, past and current use of medication and supplements, and,&#xD;
      for females only, use of contraception or hormone replacement therapy at menopause, and&#xD;
      number of completed pregnancies, when applicable. Data about close contact with confirmed or&#xD;
      suspected cases, contacts with general practitioner and/or national emergency numbers,&#xD;
      molecular tests and results (if available), hospitalization for confirmed or suspected&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-like infection, and other possible risk conditions to refer, are also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third section of the questionnaire is focused on the personal characteristics and health&#xD;
      status of respondents: questions about self-perceived health status and risk perception .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth section investigates the housing conditions: population density in the area of&#xD;
      residence, self-reported traffic intensity in the area of residence, number of rooms, number&#xD;
      of co-habitants, and presence of at-risk co-habitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fifth section focuses on lifestyles: daily mean number of contacts, smoking habit, and&#xD;
      frequency of weekly physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sixth section investigates the behaviours following the lockdown: job conditions, number&#xD;
      of times of going out per week, and use of public transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ethics Committee of the Istituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive I.R.C.C.S. Lazzaro&#xD;
      Spallanzani (Protocol No. 70, 12/4/2020) approved the EPICOVID19 study protocol. When they&#xD;
      first accessed the on-line platform, the participants were informed of the purpose of the&#xD;
      study, the data to be collected, and the method of storage. The data were handled and stored&#xD;
      in accordance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) 2016/679&#xD;
      (http://gdpr-info.eu/), and data transfer was safeguarded by means of encrypting/decrypting&#xD;
      and password protection. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
