  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to improve our knowledge of the epidemiology of patients consulting in the&#xD;
      COvid-19 Possible REspiratory Units (RECOP unit). Indeed, the epidemic linked to COVID-19&#xD;
      affects France and impacts its health system. The reception of all intermediate patients will&#xD;
      be on the Emergency Structures (SU). Indeed, the French healthcare system centralizes&#xD;
      unscheduled urgent care on the ER. The aspecific respiratory symptomatology in &quot;intermediate&quot;&#xD;
      patients indicates them all the more at an admission to SU or the diagnostic approach to&#xD;
      respiratory difficulty may be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central issue of this diagnostic strategy will be to be rapid, since the diagnosis will&#xD;
      have to be made in the context of significant flows, with a need to quickly refer patients to&#xD;
      the most suitable downstream service, while limiting the risk contamination of caregivers and&#xD;
      vulnerable patients if a COVID-19 + patient is admitted to an unsuitable service. However,&#xD;
      virological tests do not currently allow rapid results for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research project of investigatory aims to develop a predictive model of the risk of being&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive for patients admitted to the emergency room for acute dyspnea.&#xD;
