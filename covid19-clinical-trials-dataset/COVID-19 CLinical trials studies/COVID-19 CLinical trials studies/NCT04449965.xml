  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if Povidone iodine (PVP-I) rinses and throat gargles or&#xD;
      a PVP-I gel forming nasal spray compared to a placebo (a treatment that has no physical&#xD;
      effect to a person) is an effective treatment for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. These&#xD;
      patients have been diagnosed with mild/moderate COVID-19 symptoms and sent home for&#xD;
      self-isolation. Patients will be instructed to take either of the two treatments or placebo&#xD;
      twice daily for two weeks and have follow up visits 2 and 4 weeks after. The participants&#xD;
      will also complete study related procedures such as saliva sample collection, and two&#xD;
      questionnaires throughout the study period. The investigators hypothesize that COVID 19&#xD;
      positive participants who use either of the Povidone - Iodine treatment will have a reduction&#xD;
      in their viral load, develop a negative oral mucosa sample and improve their clinical&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective randomized double blinded placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      6-weeks in duration. Patients who have tested positive and diagnosed with COVID-19 within the&#xD;
      previous 72 h and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be involving non-hospitalized patients who are recovering at home. One arm&#xD;
      will use betadine sinonasal rinses and a betadine mouth gargle while another arm will act as&#xD;
      a control receiving a placebo (a food coloring agent). A third arm will use a 0.6% PVP-I gel&#xD;
      forming nasal spray twice daily. A baseline saliva sample will be collected to assure a&#xD;
      positive COVID-19 test and to quantify viral load. Repeat saliva samples will be collected&#xD;
      every 2 days for 2 weeks, then at 4 weeks and 6 weeks to quantify test status and quantify&#xD;
      viral load reduction. WURSS-44 questionnaires will be completed daily for 2 weeks and then&#xD;
      again at 4 weeks and 6 weeks. SNOT-22 questionnaires will be completed at baseline and then&#xD;
      again at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks. The investigators will also monitor for worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms and the need for hospitalization for the entire 6 week duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolment in the study after obtaining positive results for COVID-19, demographic data&#xD;
      and clinical data will be obtained by the investigators. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the study arms delineated above by permuted block randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical samples that detect COVID-19 are obtained by collecting a saliva sample prior to&#xD;
      rinsing. This will avoid confounding by artificially lowering the viral particles sampled and&#xD;
      will minimize any potentially inhibitory effects of the intervention compounds on lab&#xD;
      detection. The sample will be put into a sterile collection container and stored in the&#xD;
      fridge until it is transported to the laboratory for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the quick turnover and the rapid doubling time in the number of positive cases&#xD;
      and the unprecedented nature of this study's design and treatment, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      recruit 20 patients in each study arm as a pilot study around this subject matter. To account&#xD;
      for a drop-out rate of 25% the investigators plan to recruit 27 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to a negative/undetectable RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 saliva sample amongst patients rinsing&#xD;
           and gargling with 0.23% PVP-I compared to a placebo group measured during the study&#xD;
           treatment daily for 2 weeks and at the 4-week and 6-week mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. A Kaplan-Meier curve and log rank test will be used to compare the time to a&#xD;
           negative saliva test from the start of the study between patients receiving PVP-I to&#xD;
           those receiving the placebo. A hazard ratio of &gt;1 will favor treatment with PVP-I,&#xD;
           calculated with a 95% confidence interval by Cox proportional hazards model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. The median time to negative swab in the PVP-I group versus the control will be&#xD;
           statistically compared using the unpaired Mann-Whitney U test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. The proportion of patients with a negative sample will be compared between the&#xD;
           PVP-I group and control group at all times points using the Chi-squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. A subsequent risk factor analysis will be conducted using the cox proportional&#xD;
           hazards model, investigating the independent influence of various host and disease&#xD;
           factors on the time to a negative sample during the study period. The following relevant&#xD;
           factors included in the multivariable regression were identified a priori upon&#xD;
           consultation with experienced clinicians at our center: gender, age, smoking status&#xD;
           (yes/no), baseline viral load, known baseline lung comorbidity (yes/no) , duration of&#xD;
           symptoms before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SARS-CoV-2 viral load changes in the saliva amongst patients rinsing and gargling with&#xD;
           0.23% PVP-I compared to a placebo group measured during the study treatment daily for 2&#xD;
           weeks and at the 4-week and 6-week mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Logarithmic viral load levels in the saliva samples will be graphed and compared&#xD;
           between the PVP-I and placebo group at all time points using the unpaired Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
           test. For complete statistical analysis, a value of 1 log base 10 copies/mL will be&#xD;
           assigned to samples with undetectable viral levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time to a negative/undetectable SARS-CoV-2 saliva sample as well as SARS-CoV-2 viral&#xD;
           load changes amongst patients rinsing and gargling with 0.23% PVP-I compared to the 0.6%&#xD;
           PVP-I gel forming nasal spray for 2 weeks and at the 4-week and 6-week mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Similar analysis as per 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 2.1 above in primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in symptom scores between the PVP-I group and placebo group as assessed by the&#xD;
           SNOT-22 scores collected at baseline and at the 2-week, 4-week and 6-week mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. SNOT-22 scores will be graphed and compared between baseline and each time point&#xD;
           for each group separately using the ANOVA with repeated measures test and Bonferroni&#xD;
           post hoc test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. The change in SNOT-22 scores between baseline and each time point will be compared&#xD;
           between groups using the unpaired Mann-Whitney U test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in symptom scores between the PVP-I group and placebo group as assessed by the&#xD;
           WURSS-44 scores collected daily from baseline for 2 weeks and at the 4-week and 6-week&#xD;
           mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. WURSS-44 scores will be graphed and compared between baseline, the 2 week, 4-week&#xD;
           and 6-week marks for each group separately using the ANOVA with repeated measures test&#xD;
           and Bonferroni post hoc test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. WURSS-44 scores will be graphed and compared between baseline and at all time&#xD;
           points using the unpaired Mann-Whitney U test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The need for hospitalization between the PVP-I group and placebo group. 3.1. The&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier technique will also be used to compare the need for hospitalization from&#xD;
           the start of the study between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The change in SNOT-22 scores, WURSS-44 scores and the need for hospitalization between&#xD;
           patients rinsing and gargling with 0.23% PVP-I compared to the 0.6% PVP-I gel forming&#xD;
           nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1. Similar analysis as per 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 above in secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD) will be used to describe demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients. Results will be considered statistically significant with p&#xD;
      values &lt; 0.05. All statistical analyzes will be performed using RStudio version 3.4.1&#xD;
      (RStudio, Boston, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience signs and symptoms of iodine reaction will be noted and the code will&#xD;
      be broken so that a discussion can occur between the research supervisor and the patient&#xD;
      regarding the use of the topical iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can contact the office anytime if they notice any of the signs or symptoms of iodine&#xD;
      reaction and will be seen by the research supervisor (or designate) within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All expected and unexpected adverse events will be recorded and graded by the research&#xD;
      supervisor. Stable chronic conditions, which are present prior to the clinical trial entry&#xD;
      and do not worsen, are not considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the&#xD;
      patient's medical history.&#xD;
