  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LIINC is a study of volunteers who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (also known as&#xD;
      novel coronavirus or COVID-19) who have recovered from acute infection. The study is designed&#xD;
      to provide a specimen bank of samples with carefully characterized clinical data. LIINC&#xD;
      specimens will be used to examine multiple questions involving the virologic, immunologic,&#xD;
      and host factors involved in COVID-19, with a focus on understanding variability in the&#xD;
      long-term immune response between individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LIINC is an observational, prospective study of individuals previously infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 who have recovered from acute illness. The overall objective of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include the&#xD;
      pre-existence and development of medical conditions, measures of immune activation and&#xD;
      inflammation, changes in immunologic function, and variability in host responses. There will&#xD;
      be a specific focus on demographic differences including age, gender, and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled volunteers are seen at San Francisco General Hospital at baseline, monthly for 3&#xD;
      months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Visits include a detailed interview, saliva&#xD;
      collection, and a blood draw. Baseline visits take approximately 90 minutes, and follow up&#xD;
      visits take approximately 20-40 minutes. No personal identifiers are used for specimen bank&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt;/= 18 years, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Available laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity on a nucleic acid&#xD;
                  amplification test or by serologic testing when this becomes available, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Reference by the participant to a laboratory test performed on respiratory tract&#xD;
                  secretions or blood, fingerstick, or saliva test that was reported to the&#xD;
                  participant to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 infection,&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. And a period of 21 days or more has elapsed since the first positive test or symptoms&#xD;
             preceding the first positive test, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Self-reported or documented chronic anemia with hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL. Anemia during a&#xD;
             preceding acute illness will not be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the site investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with the ability to adhere to study requirements or to give informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements or to give informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
