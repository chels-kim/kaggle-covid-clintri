    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether malaria or malaria treatment affects COVID-19 severity, immune&#xD;
      responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus, or viral loads and/or duration of shedding and therewith the&#xD;
      onwards spread of SARS-COV-2. An observational cohort study will be conducted in 708 newly&#xD;
      diagnosed COVID-19 patient of all ages in western Kenya and Burkina-Faso. They will be&#xD;
      enrolled in hospitals with COVID-19 testing facilities from a source population screened for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (N~4,720). Approximately 142 of the 708 COVID-19 patients are expected to be&#xD;
      co-infected with malaria. They will be enrolled in the nested malaria treatment trial and&#xD;
      randomized to receive 3-days of artemether-lumefantrine (the current standard of care) or&#xD;
      pyronaridine-artesunate, a highly effective antimalarial with known antiviral properties&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro, that is newly registered and being rolled out in Africa. Disease&#xD;
      progression will be assessed and nasal swabs and blood samples will be taken during&#xD;
      home/clinic visits on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42. Patients self-isolating will be&#xD;
      phoned daily in between scheduled visits for the first 14 days to assess signs and symptoms.&#xD;
      Hospitalisation, self-isolation and home-based care will follow national guidelines. The WHO&#xD;
      clinical progression scale and FLU-PRO plus scales will be used to compare disease&#xD;
      progression between COVID-19 patients with and without malaria, and by malaria. Other&#xD;
      endpoints include seroconversion/reversion rates, chemokine/cytokine responses, T and B cell&#xD;
      responses, viral load and duration of viral carriage. Infection prevention and control (IPC),&#xD;
      including the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), and measures for patient transport&#xD;
      will follow national guidelines in each country. Written informed consent/assent will be&#xD;
      sought. The study is anticipated to start in January 2021 and last for approximately 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Africa, COVID-19 has the potential to cripple the continent's fragile&#xD;
      healthcare systems and be devastating economically. It is unknown whether malaria infection&#xD;
      worsens COVID-19, affects the acquisition of protective antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      virus, or contributes to its onwards spread by resulting in higher viral loads and/or longer&#xD;
      duration of viral shedding. It is also unknown if the effective clearance of malaria&#xD;
      parasites and/or the choice of antimalarials affects any of these potential associations. His&#xD;
      study will determine if the antimalarial pyronaridine, in the fixed-dose combination of&#xD;
      pyronaridine-artesunate, has a positive, negative or negligible effect on COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      progression or duration of viral carriage and the seroconversion rate to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A malaria treatment trial will be conducted nested within a larger observational&#xD;
      COVID-19 cohort study in highly malaria-endemic areas in western Kenya and Burkina-Faso. The&#xD;
      COVID-19 cohort study consists of approximately 708 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patient of all&#xD;
      ages. They will be enrolled from a source population of approximately 4,720 individuals of&#xD;
      all ages screened for SARS-CoV-2. It is anticipated that approximately 142 of the 708 cohort&#xD;
      participants will be co-infected with malaria. These co-infected participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the nested malaria treatment trial if they have uncomplicated malaria and are&#xD;
      able to take oral medication. They will be randomized to receive either a standard 3-day&#xD;
      treatment course of artemether-lumefantrine (the current first-line treatment) or&#xD;
      pyronaridine-artesunate, a new highly effective antimalarial combination that is being rolled&#xD;
      out as first or second-line treatment in western Kenya and Burkina Faso. All 142 patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 42 days and nasal swabs and blood samples taken on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and&#xD;
      28. Malaria smears will be taken on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance by day-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, strict adherence to infection prevention and control&#xD;
      (IPC) guidelines, including use of personal protection equipment (PPE), and measures for&#xD;
      patient transport will be followed as per national guidelines in each country. Written&#xD;
      informed consent/assent will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partners: This 18-months study is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is part&#xD;
      of a collaboration between the Kenyan Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Kenya; the US&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine&#xD;
      (LSTM); the Ministry of Health, Kenya; the Groupe de Recherche Action en Sant√© (GRAS),&#xD;
      Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; the Ministry of Health in Burkina Faso, and the London School of&#xD;
      Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). LSTM and LSHTM will act as sponsors for the studies in&#xD;
      Kenya and Burkina Faso, respectively.&#xD;
