  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy&#xD;
      of BGE-175 in participants ≥ 60 years of age hospitalized with documented COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind study of&#xD;
      BGE-175 administered PO or NG in participants ≥ 60 years of age and hospitalized with&#xD;
      documented COVID-19 who are not yet in respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, participants will be screened upon presentation at the&#xD;
      hospital. Screening will include full physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation, oxygen saturation, pre-diagnostics to measure prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) status, and&#xD;
      baseline assessment of World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for COVID-19. If&#xD;
      confirmed that the participant qualifies for this protocol according to listed inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, participants will receive the first dose of study medication, PO. The&#xD;
      participant will then receive study medication PO or NG (if intubated or unable to swallow&#xD;
      medication) once daily, at approximately the same time each day for up to 13 additional days.&#xD;
      Study medication will be administered in addition to standard of care deemed appropriate by&#xD;
      the treating physician(s). Participants will be randomized to receive BGE-175 or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored daily for all relevant efficacy outcomes, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      and adverse events. Blood will be drawn periodically for safety laboratory measurements,&#xD;
      plasma kinetics, lymphocyte subsets, C-reactive protein, and cytokines. Nasopharyngeal swabs&#xD;
      will be collected to measure viral load. Participants will be monitored for 14 days after&#xD;
      administration of the last dose (Day 28) and followed through Day 57.&#xD;
