  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine whether a novel and innovative provider&#xD;
      communication strategy is effective in improving vaccine acceptance among vaccine-hesitant&#xD;
      parents (VHPs) and visit experience among VHPs and their health care providers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this covariate constrained, cluster randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative provider communication strategy (PIVOT-MI)&#xD;
      intervention in improving provider-parent vaccine discussions and increasing vaccine&#xD;
      acceptance. Providers at intervention clinics will be trained to use the PIVOT-MI strategy in&#xD;
      which a presumptive format is used to initiate the childhood vaccine recommendation with all&#xD;
      parents, followed by use of motivational interviewing (MI) with parents who voice resistance&#xD;
      to that recommendation. Providers at control clinics will deliver care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are to evaluate the impact of PIVOT-MI, relative to control, on (1) child's&#xD;
      immunization status; (2) parent-rated visit experience with their child's provider; and (3)&#xD;
      change in provider experience of the vaccine discussion with vaccine-hesitant parents.&#xD;

    <description>To assess parent visit experience, we will administer surveys to all vaccine hesitant parents within 24-48 hours after the completion of their health supervision visit. (Update: Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we have extended the time frame to within 1 week after their health supervision visit)</description>
