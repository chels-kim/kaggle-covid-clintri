  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and early parenthood are life changing periods characterized by intense emotions&#xD;
      and a high vulnerability to emotional problems. Overall 10 - 20 % of pregnant women and women&#xD;
      in early postpartum period suffer from mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first months of 2020 , pregnant and breastfeeding women have also needed to face the&#xD;
      COVID19 pandemic including the exceptional quarantine measures that have disturbed private&#xD;
      and professional life . In addition to the fear of infection , these measures might have&#xD;
      negatively impacted the emotional wellbeing of women . As depressive symptoms and anxiety in&#xD;
      the pre and peripartum period have been associated with adverse maternal , neonatal and&#xD;
      infant outcomes , the psychological impact of COVID19 , and its associated quarantine&#xD;
      measures , on pregnant women and new mothers is cause for concern&#xD;
