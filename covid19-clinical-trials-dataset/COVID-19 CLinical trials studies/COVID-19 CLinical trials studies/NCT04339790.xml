      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 outbreak has caused many changes to people s normal social patterns. The&#xD;
      respiratory illness has been the major focus of public health efforts. But most experts also&#xD;
      agree that government and public health mandates to slow the spread of the illness, such as&#xD;
      social distancing, have a significant effect on people s mental health. Environmental&#xD;
      stressors, such as constraints on activities, social contact, and access to resources, take a&#xD;
      toll. Researchers want to learn how stressors related to COVID-19 affect mental health over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To learn the relationship between stressors related to COVID-19 and self-rated&#xD;
      measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a range of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give their first and last name and email address. They will indicate if&#xD;
      they have ever been in an NIH research study. They will get a username and password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks for up to 6 months, participants will complete online study surveys. They will&#xD;
      get email reminders. Some surveys will be repeated. At the end of the study, they will&#xD;
      complete a set of end-of-study surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surveys will ask about the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, sex, race, and other sociodemographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental and medical illness history and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility, self-care, and life activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behaviors related to alcohol and substance use disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental illness symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get links to mental health resources, such as hotlines. They will also get&#xD;
      guidance on steps to take to seek care or support.&#xD;

      Study Description: This protocol leverages existing NIMH studies and participants to&#xD;
      accomplish time-sensitive research on the mental health impact of environmental stressors&#xD;
      imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will describe the relationship between stressors&#xD;
      related to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a&#xD;
      range of participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      utilization of a study website to consent and survey participants online is an efficient and&#xD;
      timely way to collect research data during this unique public health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the relationship between stressors related&#xD;
      to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a range of&#xD;
      participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine whether existing mental health concerns moderates this&#xD;
      relationship and to identify risk and resilience factors among study participants regarding&#xD;
      the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: The primary endpoints are descriptive data on stressors experienced as a result of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic, and emotional, behavioral, and clinical symptoms. These endpoints will&#xD;
      be measured repeatedly using an online platform for up to 6 months. These repeated measures&#xD;
      will be combined with previously collected phenotype data on NIMH participants as allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The sample size will be up to 10,000 and will include participants 18 years&#xD;
      and older of both sexes, any gender, and health status. They must be English-speaking. The&#xD;
      study population will include patient and volunteer participants who have consented for a&#xD;
      NIMH study in the past as well as new participants from the general population who respond to&#xD;
      advertisements for the NIMH COVID study but who have not previously been a NIMH study&#xD;
      participant. The NIMH COVID study participants may or may not be local to the Metropolitan&#xD;
      Washington DC area but since the study will be conducted entirely online, this is not&#xD;
      relevant.&#xD;
