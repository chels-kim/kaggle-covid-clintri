      This is a non-randomized prospective open-label cohort study in patients with COVID-19 who&#xD;
      require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The active treatment group will consist of&#xD;
      patients who are treated OLE therapy while on mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from subjects in the active treatment group will be compared to retrospectively&#xD;
      collected results from patients treated with standard care with no OLE therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the control group will be identified from the population of patients previously&#xD;
      admitted to the two study sites with COVID-19 infection who required invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation but were not treated with OLE therapy. Subject data will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from the medical record.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention device use in this study is The MetaNeb® System (Hill-Rom; St. Paul, MN). It is an FDA 510k cleared device (k124032), powered by compressed gas, that delivers oscillation and lung expansion (OLE) therapy using both continuous high-frequency oscillation (CHFO) and continuous positive expiratory pressure (CPEP). The device also provides supplemental oxygen when used with compressed oxygen and can deliver aerosol therapy during CPEP and/or CHFO. The therapy is indicated for mobilization of secretions, lung expansion therapy and the treatment and prevention of pulmonary atelectasis. The device also provides supplemental oxygen when used with compressed oxygen.</description>
