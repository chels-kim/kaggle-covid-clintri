      Phase 2/3 randomized, parallel group, 2-arm study (treatment vs. control), investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of anakinra, an interleukin 1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist ( IL-1), added to standard treatment, compared to standard treatment alone, to&#xD;
      reduce hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

      This protocol has been prepared by the Systemic Autoimmune Diseases Group (GEAS) steering&#xD;
      committee from the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine (SEMI) in response to the current&#xD;
      urgent situation that are living in Spain because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The GEAS member&#xD;
      are experts in the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases and the use of biologic drugs in&#xD;
      general, and anakinra in particular. importantly, in Spain, internal medicine physicians are&#xD;
      currently involved in the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate new possibilities to reduce the number of&#xD;
      patients requiring mechanical ventilation. This is intended to address the most urgent need&#xD;
      to preserve the access to intense care unit support to the lower possible number of patients&#xD;
      and may potentially reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2019, a respiratory condition caused by what was later identified as a new&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in Wuhan Province, China. In these four months, the&#xD;
      virus has spread throughout the world's population, in more than 100 countries and affecting&#xD;
      thousands of people. The WHO declared in March that we were facing a pandemic because of this&#xD;
      virus, in which Europe could now be considered the epicenter. The strict containment measures&#xD;
      implemented in China, the mass detection of the virus with subsequent isolation of cases and&#xD;
      contacts that has been carried out in countries such as Singapore, Taiwan or South Korea seem&#xD;
      to have been useful in limiting the virus´ spread. Consequently, in our country, and given&#xD;
      the extension of the infection, a state of alarm has been decreed, at least for four weeks.&#xD;
      Despite the containment measures, numerous cases are still being diagnosed every day, with an&#xD;
      approximate lethality of 3.7%, especially in those considered at risk such as patients over&#xD;
      60 years of age and with comorbidities (Report nº 17. COVID-19 situation in Spain on 27 March&#xD;
      2020. COVID-19 team. SiViES. CNE. CNM. ISCIII).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract, it causes the disease called COVID-19. From&#xD;
      the point of view of the natural evolution of the disease, this can be a mild respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome, which will occur in approximately 80% of cases, or a more serious disease, with the&#xD;
      appearance of pulmonary infiltrates and in some patients a respiratory distress with rapidly&#xD;
      progressive worsening. This second phase, which is only reached by a subgroup of patients, is&#xD;
      usually seen in the interval between day 7 and day 10 of the infection from the onset of&#xD;
      symptoms. So far, there is no proven explanation for this great variability in its clinical&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment used in our country so far is based on the combination of hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
      azithromycin and antiretrovirals (protease inhibitors, lopinavir), based on previous&#xD;
      experiences. Several clinical trials are currently underway in Spain: PanCOVID-19&#xD;
      (Azithromycin + Hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir), GS-US-540-5774 (Remdesivir),&#xD;
      EFC16844 (Sarilumab) and WA42380 (Tocilizumab) as well as international projects such as&#xD;
      Discovery (NCT04315948), Solidarity and REMAP-CAP which include other treatment alternatives&#xD;
      such as interferon-beta-1B or Anakinra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent data from the Chinese cohorts, a subgroup of patients with COVID-19 shows&#xD;
      a very marked increase in inflammatory test data, such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL6 (&gt; 40 pg / mL) and D-dimer&#xD;
      (&gt; 0.28 μg / L), the latter two being predictive of the development of severe pneumonia&#xD;
      (sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 96.4%). Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). In this group of&#xD;
      patients in which this &quot;inflammatory profile&quot; is detected, the damage observed is not a&#xD;
      direct consequence of the viral infection (viral necrotizing pneumonia) but rather a&#xD;
      secondary hyperimmune response, mainly related to the monocyte/macrophage activation, which&#xD;
      has also been observed in autopsy studies and previously in other infections by other types&#xD;
      of coronavirus. This CSS is superimoosable to that observed in patients with secondary&#xD;
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), often triggered by viral infections or macrophage&#xD;
      activation syndrome (MAS), secondary to systemic and autoinflammatory autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group of patients there is a significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      including interleukin (IL) -1β and IL-6. Of these, IL-1β has a greater pathogenic relevance,&#xD;
      given that it promotes the inflammatory cascade and also induces the synthesis of several&#xD;
      inflammatory genes such as IL-6 itself, IL-8, MCP-1, COX-2, IκBα, IL-1α, IL-1β and MKP-1.&#xD;
      Numerous case reports and case series have been published supporting the use of IL-1β&#xD;
      blockade in the MAS. At this time, there is some experience in the treatment of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      the subgroup of patients in the inflammatory phase with Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker),&#xD;
      but no controlled studies have been completed as yet. However, IL-6 is not a key molecule in&#xD;
      the cytokine storm that triggers MAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anakinra (IL-1Ra) is a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist with a very short half-life of&#xD;
      4-6 hours, requiring a daily subcutaneous injection of a 100 mg dose. It has also been shown&#xD;
      to reduce levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6 and IL-18) and acute&#xD;
      phase reactants such as PCR and ferritin. Therefore, it has been used in the control of&#xD;
      autoinflammatory syndromes and in patients with MAS. In addition, data have been reported&#xD;
      from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial of IL-1 blockade with anakinra in sepsis with&#xD;
      characteristics of MAS, which showed a significant improvement in the 28-day survival rate&#xD;
      (65.4% anakinra vs. 35.3% placebo), with HR for death 0.28 (0.11-0.71, p = 0.0071), with no&#xD;
      increased adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown by the data available in the most recent literature generated from the Chinese&#xD;
      experience, and by the most recent data made available by the different Spanish hospitals&#xD;
      responsible for the management of these patients, hyper- inflammation, caused by a cytokine&#xD;
      storm resulting from an exaggerated response of the immune system to the presence of the&#xD;
      virus (CSS-like pneumonia), is considered to represent one of the most important negative&#xD;
      prognostic factor in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The inclusion criteria for COVID-19&#xD;
      used in this protocol is based on the analysis of routine blood chemistry data obtained from&#xD;
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This criterion has been designed with high sensitivity&#xD;
      (&gt;90%) for patients who require ICU admission. This constitute the rationale for testing&#xD;
      drugs specifically targeted to reduce the cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has been prepared for the purpose of addressing the current medical emergency,&#xD;
      given the severity of the disease and the extremely high number of individuals affected. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate anakinra to reduce the number of patients requiring&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. This is intended to address the most urgent need to preserve the&#xD;
      access to intense care unit support to the lower possible number of patients and may&#xD;
      potentially reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential applicability of the results of this clinical trial, in an extraordinary health&#xD;
      emergency such as COVID-19, is obvious. Positive results could help to define the standard&#xD;
      treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and have a dramatic impact on both local and global&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Negative results would constitute very useful scientific evidence&#xD;
      for abandoning unfounded empirical approaches and would help redirect resources and efforts&#xD;
      in another more promising direction. The expected length of time needed for recruitment is&#xD;
      3-4 weeks, depending on the epidemiological progression of the pandemic in our centers, so&#xD;
      results could be available in early May 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anakinra is a recombinant form of the human IL-Ra, r-metHuIL-1Ra, which is produced by&#xD;
      recombinant DNA technology in an E. coli expression system. Therapeutically, anakinra&#xD;
      neutralizes the biological activity of IL-1 (IL-1α and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its&#xD;
      binding to the IL-1RI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kineret (anakinra) was first approved for treatment of RA in the US in 2001 and subsequently&#xD;
      in the EU/EEA in 2002. In 2012, an sBLA on anakinra for treatment of NOMID was approved in&#xD;
      the US. Kineret is also approved for treatment of CAPS (in EU/EEA, Israel and Australia),&#xD;
      Still's disease, including SJIA and AOSD (in EU/EEA) and SJIA (in Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial IND for anakinra was granted in 1991. The estimated cumulative exposure to&#xD;
      anakinra in completed company sponsored clinical studies up to 1 May 2018 is 6404 subject-&#xD;
      years, in 8518 subjects with various indications. Anakinra is administered s.c. at doses of&#xD;
      100 mg/day (RA) or in weight-based doses of up to 8 mg/kg/day (NOMID). In clinical studies in&#xD;
      sepsis, doses up to 2 mg/kg/hour i.v. over 72 hours were administered to &gt;500 patients and&#xD;
      were well tolerated.&#xD;
