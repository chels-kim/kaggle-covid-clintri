  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national&#xD;
      sero-epidemiological survey in England in individuals aged 0-24 years, focusing on assessing&#xD;
      humoral immunity against diphtheria, Group C invasive meningococcus and SARS-CoV-2. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 2800 to 3500 individuals, divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group one (N= 2300):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will include all age groups (0-24years), with recruitment restricted by postcodes&#xD;
      provided by Public Health England (PHE) to recruit a representative population for the region&#xD;
      as assessed by the IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group two (N= up to 1200):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group has been added following additional funding to enhance the sample size in response&#xD;
      to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will recruit 0-19 year olds and will not be restricted by post&#xD;
      code sampling. Instead recruitment will be by public promotion within the normal recruiting&#xD;
      regions for each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group three (N= up to 300):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition of Group 3 which is enhanced surveillance in participants from Black, Asian or&#xD;
      minority ethnic groups (BAME). Since the start of recruitment we have noted that only 11% of&#xD;
      participants are from BAME population, despite recruiting in ethnically diverse regions.&#xD;
      Given the increased risk of COVID-19 disease in the BAME community, this is a potential&#xD;
      limitation of the study as it stands, not only because it may not reflect the diversity of&#xD;
      the UK population, but because it does not allow assessment of whether the differing disease&#xD;
      rates and seropositivity in adults are reflected in differences in seropositivity rates in&#xD;
      children. Similarly to Group 2, this will recruit 0-19 year olds and will not be restricted&#xD;
      by post code sampling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Public Health England has an ongoing sero-prevalence programme to assess how well the&#xD;
      population is protected from vaccine preventable diseases. The current way to check this is&#xD;
      by testing left over blood samples from participating healthcare laboratories around the&#xD;
      country. However, these samples may not be representative of the general population,&#xD;
      particularly in younger age groups who are often most at risk from vaccine preventable&#xD;
      diseases. In the Netherlands, they use a different system to assess how well the population&#xD;
      is protected from vaccine preventable diseases, actively collecting blood samples from a&#xD;
      representative cross section of society. This type of approach would address the limitations&#xD;
      of using residual serum samples and allows the collection of additional relevant history e.g.&#xD;
      number of family members and previous vaccines received. The investigators are therefore&#xD;
      proposing a pilot study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national sero-&#xD;
      epidemiological survey in England in individuals aged 0 - 24 years. The investigators will be&#xD;
      focusing initially on diphtheria and group C invasive meningococcal disease, both of which&#xD;
      are vaccine preventable. This will involve enrolling 2300 participants in the study from&#xD;
      different geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds across our test sites and taking a blood&#xD;
      sample. This blood will be analysed to look at the level of immunity to vaccine preventable&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original protocol has been amended to include the testing of antibodies against other&#xD;
      infectious diseases, specifically COVID-19. A second group has been added to recruit an&#xD;
      additional 500 to 1200 participants between the ages of 0-19 years. The additional funding&#xD;
      has been used to open two more sites to recruit to group two across regions on England that&#xD;
      are currently not represented by this study. Having a large number of blood samples from a&#xD;
      range of age groups is useful when gathering information about an emerging disease such as&#xD;
      the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19). These samples can help provide answers regarding&#xD;
      the true number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19 disease) in&#xD;
      this population. Group 2 can be enhanced by the samples received from other ethically&#xD;
      approved research projects where participants have consented for their samples being used&#xD;
      outside of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional funding has been granted for the addition of 300 participants from the BAME&#xD;
      community, who will form Group 3. Data from Group 3 would be invaluable in understanding&#xD;
      whether higher rates of disease in the BAME community are a result of greater exposure to&#xD;
      COVID-19 contact, a higher likelihood of being infected once exposed or a greater risk of&#xD;
      disease once infection occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to increasing the sample size and the number of regions in the UK that are being&#xD;
      sampled, a longitudinal sampling cohort has been introduced. A subset of participants equally&#xD;
      distributed over the age bands will be enrolled into the longitudinal aspect of the study&#xD;
      where repeat blood and saliva samples are taken to look for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A&#xD;
      questionnaire to ascertain whether the participant or any household contacts have had any&#xD;
      symptoms of or been tested positive for COVID-19 will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proportion of participants from this group from selected sites will also provide up to a&#xD;
      maximum of three blood samples for separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&#xD;
      to evaluate T cell responses. These participants can be either seronegative or seropositive&#xD;
      at their Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the latter addition of four more sites, all NHS regions are now represented in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Group 1 will be focusing on COVID-19, diphtheria and group C invasive meningococcal disease. The investigators are aiming to recruit around 2300 individuals and the investigators are aiming to ensure that sample is broadly representative of the region according to IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores). PHE have generated a list of all postcodes in recruiting regions and determining the quintiles of IMD within that region. Participants interested in taking part in the study will contact sites to arrange a visits. Basic demographic characteristics will be collected by questionnaire and/ or case report form (CRF) and will include: DOB, gender, GP details, Ethnic group, association with communities of special interest, household income and vaccination history.The questionnaire will gather information regarding potential COVID-19 symptoms both in the participant and the participant's household.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group 2</arm_group_label>
    <description>Group two will focus on 0-19 year olds only. They will not be restricted to the post code sampling. Instead this will include standard recruitment methods such as social media advertisements within the normal recruiting regions for each site. The questionnaire will gather information regarding potential COVID-19 symptoms both in the participant and the participant's household.&#xD;
A proportion of participants from this group from selected sites will also provide up to a maximum of three blood samples for separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to evaluate T cell responses. These participants can be either seronegative or seropositive at their Visit 1.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group 3</arm_group_label>
    <description>Group three will consist of up to 300 participants aged 0-19 from the Black, Asian and Minority ethnic population aged 0-19 years. They will not be restricted to the post code sampling and will be recruited at a sub-set of sites depending on capacity and the demographic profile of the local population. Recruitment will be by multiple approaches, including mail outs and advertising in community (e.g. community centres, religious establishments) or GP practices where we have ethics approval for them to act as PICs. These can vary according to each site's experience and their contacts within their local community on how is best to approach the BAME community.</description>

      Blood samples will be centrifuged, separated and frozen at local sites at -80°C. Ideally this&#xD;
      will happen within 24h with a window of up to 72h. Up to two 2ml aliquots per participant&#xD;
      will be shipped to PHE in batches of up to 500 on dry ice. Residual sera beyond this volume&#xD;
      will be shipped to the Oxford Vaccine Group(OVG) for storage. For participants where consent&#xD;
      is obtained for DNA extraction and storage in the Oxford Vaccine Centre biobank residual&#xD;
      blood clots will be shipped to the OVG for this purpose. Participant or their parents will&#xD;
      take the oral fluid swab on the day of the visit. Once received by the study team it will be&#xD;
      kept in a cool bag until the samples arrive in the lab. They will then be frozen to -80°&#xD;
      before being shipped to PHE. Blood samples collected for T cell testing will be shipped to&#xD;
      the OVG lab for same-day processing for separation of PBMCs. Saliva samples with be processed&#xD;
      in line with local SOPs&#xD;
