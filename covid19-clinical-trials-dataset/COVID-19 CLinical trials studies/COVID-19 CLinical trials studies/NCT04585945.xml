  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known regarding the effect of antenatal COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine of COVID-19 alters histopathology and gene expression of the&#xD;
      placenta, as evidenced by analysis at time of delivery. The analysis will aim to identify&#xD;
      whether resulting abnormal placental pathology or altered metabolism is associated with&#xD;
      severity of symptoms (specifically pneumonia, or need for admission), gestational age at&#xD;
      onset, and/or placenta efficiency. Histological and gene expression analysis of the placental&#xD;
      post-delivery will determine if COVID-19 alters overall placental structure, vascularization,&#xD;
      and/or the transcriptome.&#xD;

        The target population for the present study includes all women delivering at Greenville&#xD;
        Memorial Hospital. The opportunity for enrollment may be extended to women that deliver at&#xD;
        Greenville Memorial even if they conducted prenatal care outside of the Prisma OB/GYN&#xD;
        Center if they meet the eligibility. We aim to recruit 40 patients for analysis.&#xD;
        Additionally, 60 samples will be recruited from women delivering at NorthShore Health&#xD;
        System who test positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy.&#xD;
