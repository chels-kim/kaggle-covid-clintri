  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in 2019. Some people who&#xD;
      get sick with COVID-19 become ill requiring hospitalization. There are some medicines that&#xD;
      may help with recovery. Researchers want to see if a drug called fostamatinib may help people&#xD;
      who are hospitalized with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if fostamatinib is safe in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and gain&#xD;
      earlier insight into whether it improves outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who are hospitalized with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, including vital signs and weight. They&#xD;
      will have a blood test and chest x-ray. They will have a COVID-19 test as a swab of either&#xD;
      the back of the throat or the back of the nose. They will take a pregnancy test if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned, to take either fostamatinib pills or a placebo twice&#xD;
      daily for up to 14 days in addition to standard of care for COVID-19. If they can swallow,&#xD;
      they will take the pills by mouth with water. If they cannot swallow or are on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, the pills will be crushed, mixed with water, and given through a tube placed&#xD;
      through the nostril, or placed in the mouth, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken daily. Participants will return to the Clinical Center for safety&#xD;
      follow-up visits. At these visits, they will have a physical exam and blood tests. If they&#xD;
      cannot visit the Clinical Center, they will be contacted by phone or have a telehealth visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about two months&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the upper and lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a subset of&#xD;
      patients with a known high mortality rate. Additionally, some patients develop other organ&#xD;
      dysfunction including myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, shock along with endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and subsequently micro and macrovascular thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the underlying pathology of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be secondary to a dysregulated&#xD;
      immune response and more recently a hypercoagulable state leading to immunothrombosis.&#xD;
      Currently, two therapies have shown efficacy in large multicenter trials for the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19, one of which is an antiviral (remdesivir) and the other is an immunosuppressant&#xD;
      corticosteroid meant to dampen the immune response (dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in the intracellular&#xD;
      signaling pathways of many different immune cells. In this pilot study we propose to use&#xD;
      fostamatinib (an SYK inhibitor) as a targeted therapy for the immunological complications of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The biological mechanisms by which SYK inhibition may&#xD;
      improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 include the inhibition of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines by monocytes and macrophages, decreased production of neutrophil extracellular&#xD;
      traps (NETs) by neutrophils, and inhibition of platelet aggregation; three pathways that are&#xD;
      mediated through Fc receptors (FcR) recognition of antigen-antibody complexes or activation&#xD;
      of c-type lectin receptors (CLEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fostamatinib for the&#xD;
      treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomly assign fostamatinib or matched placebo (1:1) to approximately 60 eligible&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients who are a 5 to 7 on the 8-point scale (requiring supplemental oxygen via&#xD;
      nasal canula or noninvasive ventilation, requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation).&#xD;
