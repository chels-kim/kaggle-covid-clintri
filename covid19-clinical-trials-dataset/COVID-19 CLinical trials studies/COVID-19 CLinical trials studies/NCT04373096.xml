  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare the effectiveness of two different levels of PPE in protecting&#xD;
      front-line health care workers from self-contamination with droplets and aerosolized&#xD;
      particles during a simulated endotracheal intubation, an aerosol-generating medical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital acquired infection and death of healthcare workers is an alarming problem during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Avoiding transmission of COVID-19 to front-line health care workers in&#xD;
      Ontario with optimal Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) is a public health priority to&#xD;
      prevent attrition of the health care work force at a time when it is most needed to care for&#xD;
      the needs of Ontarians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care workers performing Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMPs) (e.g.&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy and tracheostomies) are at particularly high risk of&#xD;
      infection. During AGMPs, medical personnel are contaminated with virus-loaded micro-droplets&#xD;
      that may be suspended in the air for up to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of effective PPE is paramount in protecting health care workers during these high-risk&#xD;
      procedures. Limited world-wide supplies of PPE and disruption of supply chains is a current&#xD;
      concern. Having local sources of PPE production could help secure supply and protect&#xD;
      Ontario's health care work force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard PPE equipment used during high-risk procedures in Ontario includes a&#xD;
      fit-tested N95 mask, an open face shield, a procedure gown and double extended-cuff gloves.&#xD;
      This level of PPE leaves certain areas of the head and neck exposed to contamination with&#xD;
      viral aerosol and droplets, and could be a source for self-contamination despite meticulous&#xD;
      donning and doffing. In fact, extensive contamination of the front surfaces, the neck,&#xD;
      forearms, wrists and hands has been previously identified during simulation of medical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contamination of the upper body, especially the head and neck, hands and wrists poses the&#xD;
      highest risk of potential infection as viral contaminants in these parts of the body are most&#xD;
      likely to reach the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose and eyes, which are the recognized&#xD;
      entry points of viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to design and test a protective hood to be used in place of the&#xD;
      open shield to provide enhanced coverage of the upper body during high risk procedures. This&#xD;
      hood would be used along an N95 mask, procedure gown and double extended-cuff gloves,&#xD;
      allowing for effective barrier protection against SARS-CoV-2 rich droplets and microdroplets&#xD;
      by providing the physician with a barrier that covers his/her upper torso from contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with 2 Ontario companies (MVF &amp; Associates and Piedmont Plastics), the&#xD;
      investigatorshave designed a hood to cover the entire upper body from the head down to the&#xD;
      elbows. The hood is made of polypropylene spunbond nonwoven fabric, a waterproof, air&#xD;
      permeable material and a polycarbonate visor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a hood could positively impact the safety of airway management and other AGMPs&#xD;
      during the pandemic by reducing contamination of the upper body. The proposed study is&#xD;
      important because it is the first one to evaluate the potential impact of a hood to enhance&#xD;
      PPE. Ultimately, decreased levels of contamination by droplets may effectively reduce the&#xD;
      risk of health care worker infection by SARS CoV2 virus after an AGMP such as endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
