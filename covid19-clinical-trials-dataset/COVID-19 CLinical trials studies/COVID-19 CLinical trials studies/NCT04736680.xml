    <textblock>
      In this study we will describe the factors associated with missed virtual visit appointments&#xD;
      in an academic children´s hospital during the covid-19 pandemic and we will develop a&#xD;
      predictive model that serves as the basis for improving the Telehealth Program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric visits are a fundamental axis of health policies because actions to promote and&#xD;
      protect health have a maximum effect on children. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic a marked&#xD;
      decrease in pediatric visits was observed in scheduled and on-call visits. This fact can be&#xD;
      explained by the restriction on people's circulation necessary to contain COVID-19&#xD;
      dissemination. In this context, the population that attends the Hospital General de Niños&#xD;
      Pedro de Elizalde was especially affected, since 91% of the patients attending the&#xD;
      institution live in another district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to overcome this barrier in access to care, we decided to implement a Telehealth&#xD;
      Program that uses virtual visits as a tool for access to care. Little is known about the&#xD;
      effects that these programs can have on patients with exclusive public health coverage.&#xD;
      Although virtual visits could be a solution for access to care in an oversaturated system,&#xD;
      there is the possibility that virtual visits could not be carried out and that a significant&#xD;
      proportion will be lost, increasing inequity and difficulties in access to health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the relevance of the topic and the little information available, we propose in this&#xD;
      study to estimate the proportion of virtual visits appointments lost. On the other hand,&#xD;
      considering the possibility of avoiding the loss of virtual visits appointments, we propose&#xD;
      to describe the factors associated with missed appointments and develop a predictive model&#xD;
      that serves as the basis for improving the Telehealth Program.&#xD;

        All scheduled virtual visit appointments between August 1 2020 and 31 december 2020 will be&#xD;
        included. The sample will be randomized to allocate a generation cohort (two-thirds of the&#xD;
        sample) and a validation cohort (one third of the sample).&#xD;
