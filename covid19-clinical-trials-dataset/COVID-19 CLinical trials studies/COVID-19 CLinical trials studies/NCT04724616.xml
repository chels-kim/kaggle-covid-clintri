      Our study aims to investigate whether our CoronAviRus educaTional prOgram fOr children&#xD;
      (CARTOON) facilitates the adherence to hygiene measures and is feasible to dispel fear in&#xD;
      preschool children (3-6 years old) during the pandemic.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed at four kindergartens in&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria. About 60 children between three and six years of age attending kindergarten&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Prior inclusion in the study eligible adults have to sign a&#xD;
      parental consent form. We will randomly assign 30 children to the intervention group (n=30)&#xD;
      and 30 children to the control group (n=30). Depending on the randomization (intervention&#xD;
      group vs. control group), children either receive our CARTOON (intervention group) or no&#xD;
      educational training (control group).&#xD;

    <description>For the assessment of emotional wellbeing, fear, and burden during the pandemic we will use the emotional scale which measure feelings including emotional wellbeing, fear, and burden.&#xD;
Since it is often hard for children to describe their own feelings with words, we will use the emotional scales of Gräßler and colleagues. These scales use child-friendly illustrated pictures and can be used to support the children in naming their feelings including emotional wellbeing, fear, and burden.</description>
