      A- Methodology adopted in the retrospective study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      500 case presented from November 2019- February 2020 will be included in explore study from&#xD;
      Ain shams university Hospitals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) for hospitalized SARI patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians in the internal medicine, chest, and pediatric hospitals will be responsible for&#xD;
      obtaining oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs for laboratory testing from all hospitalized&#xD;
      patients who meet the WHO standard SARI case definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal swabbing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dry sterile tip flocked with nylon fiber swab applicator should be used to swab the&#xD;
      posterior pharynx. The swab should be placed in a 15 ML centrifuge tube labeled with the&#xD;
      patient unique ID and containing 2mL viral transport media (VTM). The applicator stick is&#xD;
      then cut off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swabbing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flexible, sterile tip flocked with nylon fiber swab applicator is inserted into the nostril&#xD;
      and back to the nasopharynx and left in place for a few seconds. It is then slowly withdrawn&#xD;
      with a rotating motion. For SARI patients, the swab is put into the same centrifuge tube as&#xD;
      the oropharyngeal swab labeled with the patient's unique ID and the shaft is cut. The 15 ml&#xD;
      tube containing the swab/s should be carefully transported to the hospital laboratory as soon&#xD;
      as possible in cold chain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The received swabs inside the 15 ml tube should be agitated vigorously for 10 seconds using a&#xD;
      vortex mixer to free cells from the swab tip, and then both swabs should be removed from the&#xD;
      tube and discarded using a forceps. The VTM should be split into 2 pre-labeled, sterile&#xD;
      cryovials with the correct patient ID. One cryovial should be immediately placed in a freezer&#xD;
      (-70°C), while the other cryovial will be used the molecular testing by real time PCR at&#xD;
      MASRI-molecular laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be tested by real time multiplex PCR using FTD- respiratory 33 kit for the&#xD;
      presence of a wide panel of respiratory pathogens that include: influenza A and subtypes&#xD;
      influenza A Pdm(H1N1) and seasonal H3, influenza B, influenza C, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2,&#xD;
      3 and 4; coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1; human metapneumoviruses A and B;&#xD;
      rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial viruses A and B ; adenovirus; enterovirus; parechovirus;&#xD;
      Boca virus; Pneumocystis jirovecii; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Chlamydia pneumoniae;&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae; Haemophilus influenza type B (HIB assay also detects Haemophilus&#xD;
      parahaemolyticus which is associated with pharyngitis); Staphylococcus aureus; Moraxella&#xD;
      catarrhalis; Bordetella spp. (except Bordetella parapertussis), Klebsiella pneumoniae;&#xD;
      Legionella species and Salmonella species. Cases suspected with MERS-CoV or HPAI H5N1&#xD;
      according to their history of contact with birds or camels or with reference to the WHO&#xD;
      suspected cases of MERS-CoV or avian influenza will be tested using the CDC protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aliquot of the samples will be stored in freezers (-70°C) at MASRI MOLECULAR&#xD;
      laboratory for External Quality Assurance (EQA) by on site testing through random selection&#xD;
      of samples with different results and retest them by other NAMRU-3 laboratory expertise in&#xD;
      MASRI molecular labs; the samples can also be used for further testing by NGS or virus&#xD;
      isolation in MASRI molecular laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Transfer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be kept in Faculty of Medicine Ain Shams Research Institute- Molecular Unit&#xD;
      laboratories and will not be transferred to other laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Explore study testing for COVID-19 using ready to use RT-real time test assays - VIRAL RNA&#xD;
      ISOLATION: Using commercially available kits supplied by thermofisher or other recommended&#xD;
      companies. Work will be done in Biosafety level 2 cabinets under complete sterile conditions.&#xD;
      -&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 DETECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR the test can be done&#xD;
      on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum&#xD;
      sample. Results are generally available within a few hours. Molecular methods leverage&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) along with nucleic acid tests, and other advanced analytical&#xD;
      techniques, to detect the genetic material of the virus using real-time reverse transcription&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction for diagnostic purposes. Commercially available kits supplied by&#xD;
      hvd, thermofisher and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C- Genome sequencing (NGS) for possible positive covid-19 samples Ion Torrent targeted&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables a streamlined research workflow for complete genome&#xD;
      sequencing and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus responsible for&#xD;
      COVID-19). Through the use of a set of highly specific, universal coronavirus primers in&#xD;
      combination with a high-fidelity master mix, all genomic segments are amplified and the DNA&#xD;
      amplicons are sequenced on any Ion Torrent system to deliver highly accurate coronavirus&#xD;
      typing in under a day. The Ion ArnpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel consists of 2 pools with&#xD;
      arnplicons ranging from 125275 bp iri length for complete viral genome sequencing&#xD;
