  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to conduct a cross-sectional survey to investigate how&#xD;
      people's lifestyle decisions and social distancing choices are affected by the medical&#xD;
      information they receive. The hypothesis is that a positive COVID-19 test result will lead to&#xD;
      study participants having the greatest self-isolation intentions compared to those who are&#xD;
      only clinically diagnosed for COVID-19 without a confirmatory diagnostic test result or those&#xD;
      who receive a negative COVID-19 test result.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When people make choices about how to socially distance, they may make different choices when&#xD;
      they have information from a doctor or other medical provider versus when they have&#xD;
      information from a test result. Are people's lifestyle decisions and choices to socially&#xD;
      distance or isolate affected by how information about their health status is communicated?&#xD;
      Does the presence of testing change the lifestyle decisions people make? We study and attempt&#xD;
      to answer these questions through a cross-sectional, online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two pilot studies will be run prior to the launching the main survey. The preliminary results&#xD;
      from these two surveys will be analyzed through EFA (exploratory factor analysis) and power&#xD;
      analysis in order to determine subscales, effect size, and appropriate sample size for the&#xD;
      main study. Additionally, a focus group consisting of approximately 15 college-educated&#xD;
      individuals will be asked to take the main survey in order to evaluate a reasonable time of&#xD;
      completion for the survey. The lower bound of this study completion duration will then be&#xD;
      utilized to establish reasonable survey completion time and thus create an exclusion&#xD;
      criterion based on time to survey completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be first invited to complete a 9 question, pre-test survey on&#xD;
      Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Respondents who pass the 4 attention check questions within the&#xD;
      pre-test will then be invited to complete the main survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 1400 participants will be recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to complete&#xD;
      the main survey. Of those, we anticipate 1194 participants to meet all inclusion criteria who&#xD;
      will then be included in the main study analysis. Participants will be included in the main&#xD;
      survey analysis if they read and agree to the English language consent form, are U.S.&#xD;
      residents (based on zip code data), correctly answer the attention check questions in both&#xD;
      the pre-test and main survey, and complete the main survey within a reasonable amount of time&#xD;
      (deemed to be 120 seconds or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be first invited to complete a 9 question, pre-test survey on Amazon's&#xD;
      Mechanical Turk. Respondents who pass the 4 attention check questions within the pre-test&#xD;
      will then be invited to complete the main survey. After consenting to participate,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to take one of three surveys each describing a different&#xD;
      scenario: one where they likely have COVID-19 but testing is not available, one where they&#xD;
      likely have COVID-19 and testing results show a positive result, and one where they likely&#xD;
      have COVID-19 and testing results show a negative result. Then, participants will be asked&#xD;
      questions about their activity and behavior intentions (e.g., stay in a specific room in my&#xD;
      home and stay away from all other people and pets, visit a friend or family member in&#xD;
      person). Participants will also be asked construct questions based off of Theory of Planned&#xD;
      Behavior/Reason Action Approach (located in the pre-test survey), along with a set of&#xD;
      demographic questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey responses will be summarized for the full sample, as well as stratified by testing&#xD;
      scenario. Quantitative responses will be summarized using means, standard deviations and&#xD;
      quartiles, and categorical and ordinal responses will be summarized using frequency&#xD;
      distributions. Comparisons between scenarios will be performed using one-way analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) for quantitative variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests for ordinal variables, and&#xD;
      chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a difference in the behavioral sum score constructed using 11 items,&#xD;
      composed of two subscales. Secondary outcomes include the 'personal decisions' and 'social&#xD;
      expectations' subscales respectively. The 'personal decisions' subscale will consist of the&#xD;
      items pertaining to masking, self-isolation, visiting friends, purchasing supplies,&#xD;
      undertaking physical activity, eating at a restaurant and having dinner at home with friends.&#xD;
      The 'social expectations' subscale will consist of the items pertaining to getting a haircut,&#xD;
      attending weddings, funerals, and birthday parties. Other secondary outcomes including&#xD;
      likelihood of voting, protesting/political gathering, and public transportation 1-item&#xD;
      questions will also be analyzed in a similar fashion across the three different arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that there will be a statistically significant difference in&#xD;
      willingness to engage in risky behavior based on COVID test results. This will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a linear regression model of the total 11-item score. The primary model term will be&#xD;
      scenario, and covariates will include age, sex, race/ethnicity, political affiliation,&#xD;
      education level, location, and type of residence. We will perform pairwise comparisons of the&#xD;
      3 scenarios, and use an 0.017 significance level (3-fold Bonferroni correction for an overall&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05). Secondary analyses will evaluate the subscales separately using a similar&#xD;
      approach. We will also perform exploratory analyses evaluating individual item responses&#xD;
      using ordinal logistic regression models with similar specifications. A 5% significance level&#xD;
      will be used for all secondary and exploratory hypothesis tests. All analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using R v. 3.6.2 (http://www.r-project.org).&#xD;
