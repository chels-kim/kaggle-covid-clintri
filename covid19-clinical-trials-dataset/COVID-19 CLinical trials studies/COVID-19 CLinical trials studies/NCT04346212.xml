  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a common complication in/post ICU patients that&#xD;
      have been with intubation/mechanical ventilation or with tracheotomies or NG tubes, in&#xD;
      patients with acute respiratory infection/pneumonia/respiratory insufficiency with a severe&#xD;
      disease needing high concentration of oxygen or noninvasive mechanical ventilation and also&#xD;
      in patients discharged from acute hospitals to rehabilitation centers, nursing homes or other&#xD;
      facilities. All these situations are common for COVID-19 patients that are currently filling&#xD;
      our hospitals due to the pandemic expansion of SARS-CoV-2. OD is associated to prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, dehydration and severe nutritional and respiratory complications -aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia-, hospital readmissions and mortality. Aim: to assess the prevalence of OD and&#xD;
      nutritional risk in these patients and to know their needs of compensatory treatment&#xD;
      following the application of an early intervention, and to assess whether OD and malnutrition&#xD;
      are indicators of poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. Methods: prospective study in which&#xD;
      we will use the volume-viscosity swallowing test (V-VST) to assess the prevalence of OD, and&#xD;
      NRS2002 to assess the nutritional risk in admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the&#xD;
      Consorci Sanitari del Maresme, Catalonia, Spain. We will register also results of the EAT-10,&#xD;
      nutritional status, the needs of compensatory treatments of these patients following an early&#xD;
      intervention with fluid and nutritional adaptation and use of nutritional supplements. We&#xD;
      will also collect other clinical variables from medical history of the patient related to&#xD;
      hospitalization and we will follow the clinical complications and nutritional status at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months follow up.&#xD;

      Design: prospective study in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to the CSdM more than 48h&#xD;
      with 2 follow-up points at 3/6 months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the prevalence of OD, nutritional risk, the needs of compensatory treatment&#xD;
           and complications at 3/6 month follow up of patients admitted by COVID-19 in Hospital de&#xD;
           Mataró, Hospital St. Jaume and the medicalized Atenea Hotel, Mataró (Barcelona), Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate an early intervention including fluid thickening and nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, we would like to know if those patients with OD and those with OD and MN&#xD;
           have worse prognosis than those without these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion criteria: Infected patients (COVID-19 + PCR or according to physician's&#xD;
                criteria at discharge medical report) admitted to the CSdM &gt;48h; patients able to&#xD;
                be explored regarding OD and nutritional status according to their physician's&#xD;
                criteria (fully awake patients in a stable respiratory situation and optimal&#xD;
                PaO2/FiO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exclusion criteria: uncontrolled risk of infection for healthcare professionals&#xD;
                (HCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      All COVID-19 patients admitted to the CSdM more than 48h from April to the end of the&#xD;
      pandemic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ICU. Patients in/post ICU with OD associated with intubation/mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
           OD associated with tracheotomies or NG tubes (semi-critical patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wards. Patients with respiratory infection/pneumonia/respiratory insufficiency, some of&#xD;
           them with a severe disease needing high concentration of oxygen or noninvasive&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation (acute patients with some complexity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-acute COVID-19 patients discharged from acute hospitals to rehabilitation centers,&#xD;
           nursing homes or medicalized facilities (sub-acute patients, convalescents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Taking into account the main study variable and that we will do an&#xD;
      opportunistic recruitment (admitted patients), a sample size of 315 subjects randomly&#xD;
      selected will suffice to estimate with a 95% confidence and a precision +/-5.5 percent units,&#xD;
      a population percentage considered to be around 55.0% (estimated OD prevalence). It has been&#xD;
      anticipated a replacement rate of 0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main variable: prevalence of OD and risk of malnutrition among COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary variables: needs of nutritional supplementation, texture-modified diets, use&#xD;
           of thickeners and patient's adherence to compensatory measures, functional capacity,&#xD;
           comorbidities, nutritional analytical parameters, weight, clinical severity (including&#xD;
           pneumonia severity), neurological symptoms, pharmacological treatment, ICU admission,&#xD;
           and hospital readmissions, visits to emergency department, respiratory infections and&#xD;
           mortality at 3 and 6 months follow-up. Clinical prognosis in those patients with OD&#xD;
           and/or MN compared to those without these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits/evaluations/management 4 evaluation points: 1) admission; 2) discharge; and 3-4)&#xD;
      follow up at 3 months and 6 months. According to the first evaluation, an interventional plan&#xD;
      (management) will be prescribed in order to improve patient's swallowing, feeding and&#xD;
      nutritional status during admission. All the evaluations and interventional plans are&#xD;
      currently being performed as standard clinical practice and will be obtained from patient's&#xD;
      medical history record. Study variables will be grouped in 3 different assessments: a)&#xD;
      clinical assessment; b) swallowing assessment; and c) nutritional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Admission*: there will be 2 admission evaluation points, the first one 24-48h after&#xD;
           admission (pre-admission data) and the second one during admission (admission data).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.Clinical evaluation: patient origin (community, nursing home, socio-health center),&#xD;
           functional status before, during admission and at discharge (Barthel index),&#xD;
           comorbidities (Charlson index), clinical symptoms before and during admission,&#xD;
           neurological symptoms, ICU admission and length of stay, respiratory infection, its&#xD;
           symptoms, severity and length from the week before admission, prescribed pharmacological&#xD;
           treatment, hospitalization days and mortality during admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.Swallowing evaluation: anamnesis, EAT-10 questionnaire (screening), clinical&#xD;
           swallowing assessment with volume-viscosity swallowing test (V-VST) at admission and&#xD;
           tolerance and adherence with the recommendations (volume and viscosity) during&#xD;
           admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.Nutritional evaluation: anthropometrical measurements and nutrition-related&#xD;
           questions pre and post-admission, analytical parameters at admission and during&#xD;
           admission (albumin, pre-albumin, cholesterol, total proteins, lymphocytes, ferritin and&#xD;
           C-reactive protein), NRS2002 at admission and at discharge and nutritional&#xD;
           recommendations during admission (ONS, type of diet and intake) and patient's adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.Codification at discharge: SARS-CoV2 pneumonia, OD, respiratory infection,&#xD;
           aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.Recommendations at discharge: fluid and nutritional recommendations at discharge&#xD;
           (volume and viscosity, oral nutritional supplementation and type of diet).&#xD;
&#xD;
           *After evaluations, healthcare professionals will give to the patients clinical&#xD;
           recommendations on the use of thickeners, texture-modified diets and nutritional&#xD;
           supplementation if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow up (3/6 months): we will collect clinical data, information about swallowing and&#xD;
           nutritional status and needs through the electronical medical history of the patients&#xD;
           and by telephone call. Patients will receive new recommendations on fluid and&#xD;
           nutritional adaptation and nutritional supplementation if required. The follow-up&#xD;
           evaluations will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.Clinical evaluation: mortality (date), patient residence (community, nursing home,&#xD;
      socio-health center), functional status (Barthel index), and hospital resources&#xD;
      consumption/clinical outcomes (hospital readmissions, visits to the emergency department, and&#xD;
      respiratory infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.Swallowing evaluation: anamnesis, EAT-10 (swallowing screening); if positive, virtual&#xD;
      clinical swallowing assessment with the V-VST, and fluid adaptation recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.Nutritional evaluation: anthropometrical measurements (current weight), ONS intake (time&#xD;
      taken from discharge), textural diet adaptation if needed and compliance with the previous&#xD;
      recommendations, NRS2002, and analytical parameters (albumin, cholesterol, ferritin,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein) if the patient had a blood analysis during the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of patients with COVID-19, OD and MN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission in our health care centers, COVID-19 patients will be screened by a speech&#xD;
      and language pathologist (SLP) for OD with specific questions and the V-VST, and nutritional&#xD;
      status with the NRS2002. In addition, clinical data of patients will be recorded during&#xD;
      admission. Those patients with a NRS2002 ≥ 3 points, will require ONS, that will be given in&#xD;
      two formats (liquid or viscosity-adapted) depending on the swallowing status. Those patients&#xD;
      with less than 70 years will receive 2 instead of 1/day. According to patient's masticatory&#xD;
      and swallowing hability they will receive texture-modified diets in 3 different formats: 1)&#xD;
      normal, 2) easy mastication diet, and 3) puree. Normal diet is composed by 1750Kcal/70g&#xD;
      protein; if the patient is at nutritional risk or malnourished (NRS2002≥3) he/she will also&#xD;
      receive a high caloric-proteic diet with 2000Kcal/90g protein. Finally there will be a fluid&#xD;
      adaptation according to the results of the V-VST with 3 different viscosities: 1)liquid,&#xD;
      2)250mPa•s, and 3)800mPa•s. During admission patients will be managed by the SLPs and the&#xD;
      nutritionist team of the healthcare centers. Just before discharge, patients will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated and swallowing and nutritional recommendations will be given adapted to the new&#xD;
      status of the patient by using the same criteria. On a nutritional level, just before&#xD;
      discharge, patients will be re-evaluated by the team of dietitians to detect those patients&#xD;
      who have not yet improved their nutritional status and therefore will need to continue taking&#xD;
      ONS after discharge. The criteria for maintaining or not maintaining the prescription at&#xD;
      discharge will be those corresponding to a normal dietary assessment, such as: anorexia, not&#xD;
      having recovered weight or insufficient intake due to vomiting, nausea or other causes not&#xD;
      related to hospital food. Other criteria may be included at the discretion of the clinical&#xD;
      professional. This group will be dispensed ONS for at least 1 month after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect also data on patient's destination, functional capacity, weight loss,&#xD;
      admission to the ICU and clinical data at discharge. Finally, patients will be followed-up at&#xD;
      3/6 months for clinical complications through their electronic medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study procedures and variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EAT-10: is a simple 10-item questionnaire to screen for the risk of dysphagia (score&gt;2,&#xD;
           risk of OD) (Belafsky P 2008, Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol; Rofes L 2014, Neurogastroenterol&#xD;
           Motil).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V-VST: is a validated clinical test to explore safety and efficacy of swallow and select&#xD;
           the optimal bolus volume and viscosity for each patient with/at risk of OD. It uses&#xD;
           different volumes (5, 10 and 20mL) and viscosities (250mPa•s, liquid and 800mPa•s)&#xD;
           (thickener Nutilis Clear) to evaluate clinical signs of impaired efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           swallow. We will apply a simplified V-VST with only 1 volume (10mL) and the 3 usual&#xD;
           viscosities in order to reduce the hospital burden and stress for the patient (Clavé P&#xD;
           2008, Clin Nutr). Recommendations on fluid adaptation given to the patient according to&#xD;
           the results of the test will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional status: a nutritional evaluation is done to COVID-19 patients according to&#xD;
           their phenotype. We will use the nutritional risk screening (NRS 2002), a validated&#xD;
           nutritional screening tool for hospitalized adult patients and has been recommended by a&#xD;
           recent guideline for COVID-19 admitted patients (Ying-Hui Jin, 2020, Mil Med Res). If&#xD;
           the patient scores 3 or more points is considered to be in nutritional risk and a more&#xD;
           comprehensive nutritional evaluation should be performed and nutritional supplementation&#xD;
           applied. Recommendations on nutritional adaptation given to the patient (adaptation of&#xD;
           texture/calories/proteins and nutritional supplementation) according to the results of&#xD;
           the tests will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other study variables collected from patient's medical history: patient origin and&#xD;
           destination at discharge, hospitalization days, admission to the ICU, myopathy post-ICU&#xD;
           and length of stay in the ICU, symptomatology before and during admission (fever, cough,&#xD;
           dyspnea, diarrhea, vomiting, ageusia, anosmia, headache, polymyalgia), neurological&#xD;
           symptoms during admission (seizures, encephalitis, delirium, headache, dyskinesia,&#xD;
           stroke, parenthesis, ataxia, encephalitis), functionality with the Barthel index&#xD;
           (pre-admission, admission and discharge), comorbidities with the Charlson score,&#xD;
           respiratory infections during admission and its severity and type, use of oxygen&#xD;
           therapy, pronation, prescribed treatment, anthropometric measurements (weight at&#xD;
           discharge, weight loss), use and tolerability of oral nutritional supplements,&#xD;
           nutritional intake, use of enteral or parenteral nutrition, biochemical parameters at&#xD;
           admission and discharge (pre-albumin, albumin, cholesterol, total proteins, lymphocytes,&#xD;
           ferritin and C-reactive protein), diagnostics at discharge (SARS-CoV2 pneumonia, OD,&#xD;
           respiratory infection, aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition or others), and intra-hospital&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up (3 and 6 months): we will collect data of clinical complications from the&#xD;
           medical history of the patient and by telephone call: swallowing, nutritional status and&#xD;
           needs (including analytical parameters), hospital readmissions, visits to the emergency&#xD;
           department, incidence of respiratory infections (including pneumonia, COPD&#xD;
           exacerbations) and mortality.&#xD;
