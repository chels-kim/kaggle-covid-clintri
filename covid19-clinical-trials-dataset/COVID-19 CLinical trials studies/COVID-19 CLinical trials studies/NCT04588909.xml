    <textblock>
      Due to COVID 19 (Corona virus disease)pandemic, majority of surgeries, including surgery for&#xD;
      cancer patients got delayed across the globe. Surgeries were limited to emergency set up&#xD;
      only. At our institute we tried to perform colorectal cancer surgeries through out the&#xD;
      pandemic, albeit in less numbers, as we thought cancer in itself is an emergency setting. we&#xD;
      are planning to analyse the prospectively managed database of this particular group of&#xD;
      patients over a period of last six 6 months and look out at 30 day post operative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Besides we will try to analyse the implications of our decision to carry on&#xD;
      with cancer surgeries in terms of number of health care workers who got infected while being&#xD;
      involved in primary care of these patients.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Health systems all across the globe have been under tremendous stress due to&#xD;
      COVID 19 pandemic. Based on information suggesting that India was faring better compared to&#xD;
      the west [1] and that oncology patients were likely to get deferred care with significant&#xD;
      implications [2], the department of general surgery (colorectal division) took a conscious&#xD;
      decision to continue offering elective cancer surgeries albeit in less numbers.in this study&#xD;
      we will try to collect 30 day post operative outcome data of elective colorectal cancer&#xD;
      resections at our department and discuss the implications of our decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such reports are still sparsely reported from Covid hotspots around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze the prospective database of the department of colorectal surgery at Sheri&#xD;
      Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, a tertiary referral centre and a high volume&#xD;
      centre for colorectal cancer surgeries ( with more than 300 colorectal cancer surgeries&#xD;
      performed every year) in North India wef 23rd March to 22nd September 2020 (6 months).and&#xD;
      report outcomes of all elective colorectal cancer surgeries. Each patient will be followed up&#xD;
      for 30 days, thereby last follow up will end on 22nd October 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All colorectal cancer patients subjected to elective and emergency surgeries during COVID 19&#xD;
      pandemic will be included. Patients who were positive for SARS CoV2 (Severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2) infection and underwent surgery for colorectal cancer will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be statistically analysed using Statistical Product and Statistical&#xD;
      Solutions(SPSS) sotware v 23. All categorical variables will be shown in the form of&#xD;
      frequency and percentage. Continuous variables will further be analysed by independent t test&#xD;
      and using multivariate analysis.&#xD;
