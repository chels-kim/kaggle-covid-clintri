      This is a 6-month, 100% remote study that will collect a broad range of data that may provide&#xD;
      insight into the COVID-19 global pandemic. Data collected will include participant medical&#xD;
      histories, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and exposure to known cases. On an ongoing&#xD;
      basis data will be collected on new contacts with known cases, the presence of COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms, including severity and outcome, and information on the immune system response to&#xD;

      This is a 6-month, 100% remote study that will collect a broad range of data that may provide&#xD;
      insight into the COVID-19 global pandemic. All data will be collected by participant entry&#xD;
      into a mobile app designed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, participants will be asked a series of questions about their prior&#xD;
      exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus including reporting prior test results, and identification&#xD;
      and description of contact with known or cases or other high risk encounters. Participants&#xD;
      will also provide a detailed medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On on ongoing basis, participants will be asked to report any symptoms associated with&#xD;
      COVID-19 that they develop, and any new contacts they experience with known cases. Some&#xD;
      participants will be sent an at-home SARS-CoV-2 antibody test and asked to report the&#xD;
      results. In addition, participants will be asked to report the result of any other test they&#xD;
      receive for COVID-19 outside of the study.&#xD;
