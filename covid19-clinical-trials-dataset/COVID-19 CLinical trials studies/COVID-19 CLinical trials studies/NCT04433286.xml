    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional survey which will be distributed online between surgeons. The&#xD;
      survey was proposed by a consensus of consultants of surgery and revised by an improvement&#xD;
      consultant. It consists of a semi-structured questionnaire that is provided in English&#xD;
      language. The survey will be conducted online through an online survey development&#xD;
      cloud-based software (SurveyMonkey®; San Mateo, CA, USA). Participants will be aware of the&#xD;
      nature of the survey and informed that they will be listed as co-authors. Collected data will&#xD;
      be confidential and anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first sector of the questionnaire includes trainee demographics and baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. Then the questionnaire aims to compare the trainee experience before and&#xD;
      after the pandemic with focus on research activities, clinical, and surgical practice.&#xD;

      after the pandemic with focus on research activities, clinical, and surgical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS v. 20. Data distribution will be tested for&#xD;
      normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be expressed as group percentages and will be compared for independent samples using the&#xD;
      Chi-square test. Continuous data of the survey will be presented as medians with ranges or&#xD;
      means and standard deviations. A comparison of continuous data will be compared for&#xD;
      independent samples using the T-test or Mann-Whitney test according to the data distribution.&#xD;
      Spearman correlation coefficient will be used for further assessment of the strength of the&#xD;
      association between variables. The statistical significance level will be set at &lt;0.05.&#xD;
