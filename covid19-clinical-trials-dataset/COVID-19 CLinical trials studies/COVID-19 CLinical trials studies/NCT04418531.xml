  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which&#xD;
      originated in Wuhan, China, has become a major concern all over the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the&#xD;
      survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite&#xD;
      treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital&#xD;
      stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not&#xD;
      treated with convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who&#xD;
      have recovered from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with&#xD;
      active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over&#xD;
      the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied.&#xD;
      Moreover, plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid With&#xD;
      either albumin or fresh frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in&#xD;
      the plasma donor and in the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient&#xD;
      with COVID 19 pneumonia. The use of plasma as a substitution fluid further increases&#xD;
      treatment costs and is associated with risk of infections, allergic reactions and&#xD;
      citrate-induced hypocalcemia. Albumin is better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges&#xD;
      using albumin solutions increase the risk of bleeding because of progressive coagulation&#xD;
      factor depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be in part overcome by using selective&#xD;
      apheresis methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP)3. During DFPP, plasma is&#xD;
      separated from cellular components by a plasma filter, and is then allowed to pass through a&#xD;
      fractionator filter. Depending on the membrane cut-off, the fractionator filter retains&#xD;
      larger molecules and returns fluid along with smaller molecules to the circulation. Thus, the&#xD;
      selection of a membrane with an appropriate sieving coefficient for IgG allows to efficiently&#xD;
      clear autoantibodies in patients with antibody-mediated diseases (e.g., macroglobulinemia,&#xD;
      myasthenia gravis and rheumatoid arthritis) with negligible fluid losses and limited removal&#xD;
      of albumin and coagulation factors1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with severe membranous nephropathy and high titer of autoreactive, nephritogenic&#xD;
      antibodies against the podocyte-expressed M type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), DFPP&#xD;
      accelerated anti PLA2R depletion4. Measurement of the antibody titer in treated patient and&#xD;
      recovered fluid showed that antibody removal was extremely effective and that large part of&#xD;
      antibodies was removed during the first DFPP procedure. This therapeutic regimen was safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated and easy to apply4. In an ongoing pilot study we found that the same&#xD;
      methodological approach can be used to remove circulating antibodies from patients who&#xD;
      recovered from COVID 19 and to infuse these antibodies in patients with active viral&#xD;
      infection. Treatment was well tolerated and preliminary findings are encouraging. Thus, in&#xD;
      this novel pilot study we aim to explore whether the infusion of antibodies obtained with one&#xD;
      single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent donors could offer an effective and safe&#xD;
      therapeutic option for patients with earlier stages of coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia&#xD;
      requiring oxygen supply without mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
