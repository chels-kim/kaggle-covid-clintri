  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of HFB30132A when it is&#xD;
      given by intravenously to healthy participants. Blood tests will be done to check how much&#xD;
      HFB30132A is in the bloodstream and how long the body takes to eliminate it. Participation&#xD;
      may include up to ten visits to the study center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first time in human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and&#xD;
      dose escalation study in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Screening Period of up to 30 days (Day -30 through Day -1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Treatment Period during which participants will be resident at the Observation Unit&#xD;
           from Day -1, 1 day before Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration (on Day&#xD;
           1) until at least 24 hours after IMP administration, will be discharged on Day 2 after&#xD;
           all safety and/or pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations have been completed, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Follow up Period lasting 180 days after the IMP dose. The study will be conducted at a&#xD;
           single study center in Cincinnati.&#xD;

             examination, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body&#xD;
             temperature measurement, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests prior&#xD;

             final Follow-up Visit on Day 270. Note: complete abstinence from sexual intercourse is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to abstain from sperm donation from initial study drug&#xD;
             administration through 3 months after the last Follow-up Visit on Day 180.&#xD;
