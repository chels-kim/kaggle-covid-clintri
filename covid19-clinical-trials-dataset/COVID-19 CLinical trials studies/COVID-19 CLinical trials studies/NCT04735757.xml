  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19-infection has a large impact on the respiratory system and possibly on the&#xD;
      diaphragm, the main respiratory muscle. In ICU-patients, diaphragm weakness is associated&#xD;
      with prolonged ICU-stay, difficult weaning and increased mortality. Our research group&#xD;
      recently found evidence for fibrosis and expression of genes involved in fibrosis as well as&#xD;
      viral infiltration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in diaphragm biopsies from COVID-19 ICU patients.&#xD;
      This finding suggests a unique manifestation of diaphragm injury in COVID-19 patients after&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. However, it remains unclear what the exact nature and location of&#xD;
      diaphragm injury is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, it is largely unknown whether this injury affects the movement of the&#xD;
      diaphragm, but this might have important clinical implications. Therefore, we aim at&#xD;
      visualizing the tissue characteristics and movement of the diaphragm in COVID-19 patients who&#xD;
      recently received long-term mechanical ventilation, other ICU patients and healthy controls,&#xD;
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI of the diaphragm was already shown feasible in&#xD;
      previous research from our group (article currently under review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New insights in the characteristics of diaphragm weakness and injury in COVID-19 patients and&#xD;
      control ICU-patients will contribute to strategies to prevent it and monitor the diaphragm of&#xD;
      patients under mechanical ventilation, which can contribute to better patient outcomes.&#xD;
