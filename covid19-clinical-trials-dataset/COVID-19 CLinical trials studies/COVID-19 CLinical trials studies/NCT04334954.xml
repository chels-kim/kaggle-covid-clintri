      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory virus outbreaks and pandemics, such as SARS, MERS, and the new SARS-COV2 virus,&#xD;
      have major impacts worldwide. Researchers must act quickly to learn about the exposures and&#xD;
      immunity in the general population. This can be done by studying people s blood serum to find&#xD;
      those with antibodies to the virus. This knowledge can help in current and future pandemics.&#xD;
      In this study, researchers want to find people who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies but no&#xD;
      known exposure or illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the number of people with detectable antibodies to SARS-COV2 from a sampling of&#xD;
      adults who have no known exposure or clinical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older without a confirmed COVID19 infection or current symptoms consistent&#xD;
      with COVID19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enroll and give consent over the phone. They will be screened over the&#xD;
      phone with a health assessment questionnaire. They will be screened for COVID19 using the NIH&#xD;
      COVID19 screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood sample. They can go to the NIH Clinical Center or do home&#xD;
      blood sampling. In-person collection at NIH is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants go to NIH, 2 tubes of blood will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants do home sampling, they will be sent a home sampling kit. The kit contains&#xD;
      gauze, an alcohol pad, a lancet, collection devices, and shipping materials. It also contains&#xD;
      detailed instructions. They will collect 80ul of blood and mail it to the NIH lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may enroll in the study up to 4 times. They cannot enroll within 30 days of&#xD;
      previous enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that respiratory virus outbreaks and pandemics, such as influenza,&#xD;
      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-COV2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.&#xD;
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and&#xD;
      immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through&#xD;
      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the&#xD;
      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to&#xD;
      current and future pandemics. In this natural history study, we will collect blood from&#xD;
      individuals to identify those who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies present despite no confirmed&#xD;
      disease or known exposures.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. &gt;= 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Willing and able to complete a verbal telephone consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Willing to undergo one blood draw or home blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Willing to have blood samples stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Have previously participated in Phase 1 of this study (inclusion for Phase II&#xD;
                  only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-enrollment Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants may be co-enrolled in other research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Confirmed history of COVID19 infection or exposure (exclusion for Phase I only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current symptoms consistent with COVID19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition or event that, in the PI s opinion, may substantially increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or compromise the study's scientific objectives.&#xD;
             Conditions that exclude a subject are considered to be unlikely, but an example would&#xD;
             include having a blood clotting disorder that would make it unsafe to obtain blood&#xD;
             samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not willing to have blood samples stored for future research.&#xD;
