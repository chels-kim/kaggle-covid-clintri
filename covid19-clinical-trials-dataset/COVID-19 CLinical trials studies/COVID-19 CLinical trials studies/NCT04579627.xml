  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational cross sectional questionnaire study looking into facial hair of hospital&#xD;
      doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how personal protective equipment guidance has&#xD;
      affected this.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus which has caused a global pandemic. There have been&#xD;
      significant health consequences for healthcare workers, which may be related to the provision&#xD;
      of personal protective equipment (PPE). Following PPE guidance is a significant health and&#xD;
      safety concern, under which facial hair guidance for tight fitting masks falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has implications as FFP3 masks are not the only form of PPE for the face, and this study&#xD;
      may highlight a need for employers to diversify which PPE they supply to their employees,&#xD;
      such as full hoods if staff need to maintain facial hair for cultural or religious reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, facial hair has potential implications for patient safety, but also these have to be&#xD;
      balanced with personal or religious reasons for maintaining facial hair. Our study aimed to&#xD;
      determine the facial hair styles of hospital doctors, and reasons for maintaining them during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. We also looked at whether these styles adhered to the PPE guidance set&#xD;
      about by Public Health England (PHE)&#xD;
