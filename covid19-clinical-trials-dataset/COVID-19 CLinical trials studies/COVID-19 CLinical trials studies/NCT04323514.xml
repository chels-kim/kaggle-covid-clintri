  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different studies showed that ascorbic acid (vitaminC) positively affects the development and&#xD;
      maturation of T-lymphocytes, in particular NK (natural Killer) cells involved in the immune&#xD;
      response to viral agents. It also contributes to the inhibition of ROS production and to the&#xD;
      remodulation of the cytokine network typical of systemic inflammatory syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of vitamin C administration in terms&#xD;
      of reducing mortality, in patients with sepsis hospitalized in intensive care wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this background, in the light of the current COVID-19 emergency, since the&#xD;
      investigators cannot carry out a randomized controlled trial, it is their intention to&#xD;
      conduct a study in the cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia, administering&#xD;
      10 gr of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sars-COV-2, has spread all over the world, in two months after its discovery in China.&#xD;
      Outbreaks have been reported in more than 50 countries with more than 118,223 confirmed cases&#xD;
      and 4,291 deaths worldwide. In Italy, the scenario is progressively worsening with 8514&#xD;
      confirmed cases and 631 deaths at 10/3/2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the spread of this new virus there has been an increase in the number of pneumonia&#xD;
      identified with the term novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which are&#xD;
      characterized by fever, asthenia, dry cough, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time,&#xD;
      elevated lactic dehydrogenase, and a tomographic imaging indicative of interstitial pneumonia&#xD;
      (ground glass and patchy shadows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown the efficacy of vitamin C and thiamine administration in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for sepsis in the setting of intensive wards in terms of mortality reduction.&#xD;
      The use of intravenously vitamin C arises from the experimental evidence of its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Vitamin C causes a greater proliferation of&#xD;
      natural killers without affecting their functionality. Moreover, the vitamin C reduces the&#xD;
      production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that contribute to the activation of the&#xD;
      inflammosomi and, in particular, the NLRP3 that affetcs the maturation and secretion of&#xD;
      cytokines such as IL1beta and IL-18 that are involved in the inflammatory systemic syndrome&#xD;
      that characterized sepsis. Vitamin C blocks the expression of ICAM-1 and activation of&#xD;
      NFKappaB that are involved in inflammatory, neoplastic, and apoptotic processes by the&#xD;
      inhibition of TNFalfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the use of vitamin C could be effective in terms of mortality and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes in the cohort of patients with covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the emergency of SARS-VOC-2 and the impossibility of carrying out a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study, it is their intention to conduct an intervention protocol (administration&#xD;
      of 10 grams of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy) involving the&#xD;
      cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An uncontrolled longitudinal study will be conducted at the Arnas Civico-di&#xD;
      Cristina-Benfratelli National Relevance Hospital in Palermo. This study will include all&#xD;
      patients consecutively hospitalized with positive swab test of SARS-CoV-2 and interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonia or with interstitial pneumonia with indication of intubation. At the admission,&#xD;
      data will be collected: personal and anamnestic information, clinical and laboratory findings&#xD;
      such as Gender, Age, Ethnicity, Comorbidities, Drugs, blood urea nitrogen, Creatinine,&#xD;
      Electrolytes, Blood cell count, Clearance of the lactates, PCR, PCT, SOFA score, liver&#xD;
      function, Coagulation, Blood gas analysis, Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, Sp02,&#xD;
      Glycaemia, Body Mass Index (BMI). Length of hospital stay will be recorded. After written&#xD;
      informed consent, 10 grams of vitamin C in 250 ml of saline to infuse at a rate of 60 drops /&#xD;
      minute will be administered. In-hospital mortality, reduction of PCR levels &gt; 50% in&#xD;
      comparison with PCR levels at the admission within 72 hours after the administration, lactate&#xD;
      clearance, length of hospital stay, resolution of symptoms, duration of positive swab (days).&#xD;
      Resolution of the CT imaging will be analysed. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.1.&#xD;
      College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) was used for database management and analysis.&#xD;
