  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung ultrasound (LUS) has also been shown to be more accurate than chest x-ray in identifying&#xD;
      pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema, both of which are found in patients with COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize implementation of LUS by hospitalists in the management of&#xD;
      suspected or diagnosed patients with COVID-19 will reduce the need for Chest CT and chest&#xD;
      x-ray, thereby conserving PPE, reducing risk of transmission to technicians and conserving&#xD;
      the resources of radiology services that would otherwise be overwhelmed by patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 in need of chest imaging. Using the methods of implementation science, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to respond to the urgent need for rapid implementation of LUS by&#xD;
      hospitalists in management of adult patients hospitalized for COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: Using a rapid-cycle weekly Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle and Rapid Iterative RE-AIM, to&#xD;
      optimize the implementation of LUS by adult hospitalists in the management of COVID-19&#xD;
      patients in a pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Evaluate this pilot implementation of LUS by adult hospitalists using the Reach,&#xD;
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.&#xD;

      Study overview:. The investigators will begin LUS implementation using strategies that target&#xD;
      barriers already identified by hospitalists in prior qualitative work. The investigators will&#xD;
      then proceed to conduct weekly rapid Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles informed by Rapid Iterative&#xD;
      RE-AIM, in order to ensure timely identification of implementation barriers. Rapid Iterative&#xD;
      RE- AIM is an innovative application of the RE-AIM framework in which screening assessments&#xD;
      of RE-AIM outcomes (e.g. level of reach, adoption, implementation) which is performed at&#xD;
      regular intervals during implementation and has been shown to be a feasible means of&#xD;
      assessing interval implementation. For outcomes not meeting target implementation at our&#xD;
      interval assessments, we will perform rapid qualitative interviews of key stakeholders to&#xD;
      identify current barriers. Using the contextual domains of PRISM and rapid qualitative data&#xD;
      from stakeholders we will select new or adapt existing implementation strategies,&#xD;
      facilitating robust implementation. Study outcomes will be measured using the RE-AIM outcomes&#xD;
      from PRISM including Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: University of Colorado Hospital is a 620 beds academic tertiary care center in&#xD;
      Denver, Colorado.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment: Hospitalist participants will be recruited from among the faculty of&#xD;
      University of Colorado Hospital Division of hospital medicine which has over 100 physician&#xD;
      and advanced practice clinicians (APPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hospitalist physicians and APPs will be offered training in LUS. The training module to&#xD;
      be used has been shown to be effective at training providers to competency. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate acceptability and feasibility of the training module using rapid qualitative&#xD;
      techniques and questionnaires of both completers and non-completers. Once a provider has&#xD;
      completed training, she may begin performing LUS on COVID patients. The images will be&#xD;
      wirelessly uploaded into PACS. The provider's LUS interpretation will be documented in the&#xD;
      EMR. Rapid Iterative RE-AIM will be performed on a weekly basis as a means of iteratively&#xD;
      screening for implementation barriers. The implementation outcomes of both fidelity and&#xD;
      adaptation will be prioritized although all aspects of implementation will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Interval Reach will be screened for using EMR data. For RE-AIM domains with poor&#xD;
      implementation, the investigators will use rapid qualitative methods to obtain stakeholder&#xD;
      perspectives of barriers and suggestions for adaptations to existing strategies or new&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures/Data Collection Study Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reach: The investigators will measure the percentage of patients hospitalized with a positive&#xD;
      COVID test result who received a LUS during the hospitalization. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the demographics and characteristics of the eligible patients who received a LUS&#xD;
      versus those that did not in order to identify disparities in implementation that can be&#xD;
      addressed by adapting our implementation strategies. The investigators will explore the&#xD;
      underlying reasons for disparities in Reach using rapid qualitative interviews of providers&#xD;
      and other stakeholders as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness: Using a quasi-experimental interrupted time series design, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the number of chest x-rays and CTs performed, PPE use and inpatient mortality in&#xD;
      patient hospitalized with COVID before implementation of LUS versus after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoption by clinicians will be measured by calculating the percentage of clinicians who&#xD;
      completed the LUS training module within the UCH hospitalist group. The investigators will&#xD;
      also measure the percentage of clinicians who performed at least 1 LUS exam. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate for differences between providers who did and did not complete&#xD;
      training. The investigators will interview hospitalists who did not complete training or did&#xD;
      not perform LUS to understand why LUS was not adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will focus on collecting implementation outcomes that are particularly&#xD;
      relevant to the evaluation of diagnostic tests. Fidelity will be measured using data&#xD;
      available through the EMR and through qualitative interviews of providers regarding their&#xD;
      clinical decision-making. EMR data will be gathered by random selection of at least 10% of&#xD;
      LUS exams within the EMR over the prior 30 days using the following 3 components to evaluate&#xD;
      fidelity. 1. Image quality: Through the EMR, the investigators will assess whether image&#xD;
      acquisition was adequate using a checklist of image requirements. 2. Image interpretation:&#xD;
      the investigators will review interpretation of POCUS by assessing ultrasound reports in the&#xD;
      EMR using a checklist 3. Clinical Decision-making using the LUS result: Assess appropriate&#xD;
      integration of POCUS findings into the clinical decision-making by review of the LUS report&#xD;
      in the EMR and daily clinician progress notes well as through qualitative interviews of&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility/Acceptability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure feasibility and acceptability of the 1) LUS training module 2)&#xD;
      use of LUS for evaluation of patients with COVID using a questionnaire as well as rapid&#xD;
      qualitative interviews of hospitalists and other stakeholders&#xD;
