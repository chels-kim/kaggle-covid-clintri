  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of telemedicine in musculoskeletal assessment has been historically low. The current&#xD;
      COVID 19 global pandemic has forced a paradigm shift with many centers rapidly adopting&#xD;
      virtual visits to conduct care resulting in rapid expansion of use of telemedicine amongst&#xD;
      practices. Mayoclinic has published The Telemedicine Musculoskeletal Examination for adults.&#xD;
      Paediatric Musculoskeletal Matters (PMM) has put video Pediatric Gait, Arms, Legs and Spine&#xD;
      (V-pGALS) assessment sheet on their website. However, there is a lack of the acceptability&#xD;
      and reliability of these tools. The aim of this study is to investigate acceptability and&#xD;
      reliability of real-time virtual video Pediatric Gait, Arms, Legs and Spine (V-pGALS)&#xD;
      assessment for musculoskeletal assessment of children for telemedicine visits.&#xD;

      The use of telemedicine in musculoskeletal assessment has been historically low. The current&#xD;
      COVID 19 global pandemic has forced a paradigm shift with many centers rapidly adopting&#xD;
      virtual visits to conduct care resulting in rapid expansion of the use of telemedicine&#xD;
      amongst practices. Mayoclinic has published The Telemedicine Musculoskeletal Examination for&#xD;
      adults. 'Paediatric Musculoskeletal Matters' (PMM- www.pmmonline.org, is a free,&#xD;
      evidence-based, and peer-reviewed open e-resource for pediatric musculoskeletal (MSK)&#xD;
      medicine targeting non-MSK specialists. They have also published video Pediatric Gait, Arms,&#xD;
      Legs and Spine (V-pGALS), an assessment sheet for telemedicine visits on their webpage.&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of the acceptability and reliability of these tools. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate acceptability and reliability of real-time virtual video Pediatric&#xD;
      Gait, Arms, Legs and Spine (V-pGALS) assessment for musculoskeletal assessment of children&#xD;
      for telemedicine visits. For this purpose, children at between the ages of 7-18 who admitted&#xD;
      the Pediatric Rehabilitation outpatient clinic of Department of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation of Marmara University School of Medicine will be recruited to the study. They&#xD;
      will be evaluated via V-pGALS face to face on the day of admission and the physiatrist will&#xD;
      record the diagnosis if there is. Within 24 hours the child will be reevaluated via V-pGALS&#xD;
      by using Zoom application virtually. The acceptability of V-pGALS examination to the child&#xD;
      and parents in terms of the duration and additional discomfort caused was evaluated using&#xD;
      visual analog scale with smiley faces (0-10, 0 for full acceptability).&#xD;

    <description>The Video-pGALS includes maneuvers from pediatric regional examination of the musculoskeletal system (pREMS) and derived from the pediatric gait arms legs spine examination assessment which is a validated simple basic musculoskeletal (MSK) examination for children. V-pGALS offers a structured approach to a cursory overview MSK exam with a focus on range of movement and symmetry. Utilizing the parent or caregiver to feel the joint in question for obvious warmth/ swelling or to palpate for point of maximal tenderness can add important information.</description>
