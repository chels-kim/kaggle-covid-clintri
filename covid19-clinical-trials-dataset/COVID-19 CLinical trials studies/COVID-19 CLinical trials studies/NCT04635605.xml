  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite enormous progress in understanding COVID-19, there is little evidence that a&#xD;
      solution, therapeutic or preventive, is close to being achieved. Repurposing of well known,&#xD;
      widely available drugs represent an attractive approach to speed up availability of active&#xD;
      treatments. Such substances as i.e. hydroxychloroquine and others, are already under&#xD;
      investigation and in widespread off label use. For many reasons Methylene blue (MB), the&#xD;
      oldest synthetic substance in medicine (1876 synthesized by BASF) is such a promising&#xD;
      candidate for an active treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infected people and for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, 28 and 84 days after diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of the administered drug are registered as &quot;adverse events&quot;, which are all symptoms related or supposed to be related to the drug that appeared after the drug intake and were NOT present at baseline or before Adverse events are expressed as present (1) or absent (0), in the dedicated data sheet which will be collected at each scheduled visit</description>
