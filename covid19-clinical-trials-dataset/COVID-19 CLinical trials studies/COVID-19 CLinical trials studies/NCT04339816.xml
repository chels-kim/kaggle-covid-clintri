    <textblock>
      Introduction Background and objectives. In early 2020 novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)&#xD;
      begun to spread from Asia to Europe and beyond forcing WHO to declare global pandemic.&#xD;
      Infected patients shed the virus for a median of 20 days. Up to 10% of COVID-19 infected&#xD;
      patients develop a severe form of disease requiring intensive care admission and some of them&#xD;
      die. SARS-Cov2 is encapsulated positive strand RNA virus that uses ACE-2 of type 2&#xD;
      pneumocytes as binding sites. It has been hypothesised (Gattinoni 2020 ICM editorial) that&#xD;
      initial hypoxemia caused by loss of primary injury to pulmonary vasculature leads to&#xD;
      hyperventilation and patients self-inflicted lung injury predominantly in lung areas of&#xD;
      increase stress and strain. In turn, later during the course of the disease, ARDS develops&#xD;
      with a typical restrictive pattern of a stiff, wet and recruitable lung. At presents there is&#xD;
      no evidence-based causative treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and there is a burning need of&#xD;
      randomised-controlled trials to find effective therapeutic strategies intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation of rationale: Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyrias. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively&#xD;
      higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 known to be susceptible in vitro to exposure to&#xD;
      Hydrochloroquine. At the moment clinical trials are ongoing to test clinical efficacy in pre-&#xD;
      and post-exposure prophylaxis in SARS-CoV-2. In one highly cited French non-randomised&#xD;
      observational study by Gautret et. al., a significant reduction of virus carriage has been&#xD;
      observed in patients co-incidentally treated by Azithromycin in addition to Hydrochloroquine&#xD;
      as a part of initial empirical therapy of community-acquired pneumonia. Azithromycin is a&#xD;
      macrolide antibiotic, which binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus&#xD;
      inhibiting translation of mRNA. The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined&#xD;
      as positive-sense can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins and&#xD;
      the effects of Azithromycin on this process are not known. No data are available at present&#xD;
      on the clinical efficacy of Hydrochloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin and it&#xD;
      is likely that any treatment affecting virus replication would only be effective if&#xD;
      administered early, before overt ARDS develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of this, the investigators designed a trial in which a hypothesis is tested,&#xD;
      that early administation of hydrochlorochine alone or in combination with azithromycin can&#xD;
      prevent respiratory deterioration in patients admitted to intensive care due to rapidly&#xD;
      progressive COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Trial design: Prospective, multi-centre, randomised, pragmatic, double blind trial&#xD;
      Participants: Eligibility criteria for participants: Adult (&gt;18 years) within 24 hours of&#xD;
      admission to intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 infection. For the purpose&#xD;
      of this study, intensive care unit is defined as a facility that allow continuous monitoring&#xD;
      of vital functions and oxygen administration . It is expected that most patients will have&#xD;
      rtPCR test known within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Nonetheless, if this is not the&#xD;
      case (eg. due to overloaded lab facility, lack of supplies) it is possible to randomise a&#xD;
      patient based on a strong clinical suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In case COVID-19 is not&#xD;
      confirmed in retrospect, experimental therapy is withdrawn and the study subject is withdrawn&#xD;
      from &quot;per protocol&quot; analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes, but remains in&#xD;
      &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; cohort for the analysis of safety. Exclusion criteria: symptoms of&#xD;
      febrile disease for ≥1 week, pregnancy, treatment limitations in place or moribund patients,&#xD;
      allergy or intolerance of any study treatment, incl. long QT syndromes, myasthenia gravis,&#xD;
      allergies or known deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, participation in another&#xD;
      outcome-based interventional trial within last 30 days, patients taking Hydrochloroquine for&#xD;
      other indication than COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and locations: Central study site is FNKV University Hospital Prague, updated list&#xD;
      of participating centres is listed in the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Standard of care. All patients will receive best supportive care that will be&#xD;
      monitored, but not protocolised. It is recognised that in the standard of care may&#xD;
      substantially differ among study centres and that is why randomisation is stratified. The&#xD;
      standard of care also may change in time during the course of the study, for example, if a&#xD;
      new evidence emerges and changes the state-of-the art treatment recommendations. Any such&#xD;
      event will trigger emergency steering committee meeting, and decision will be taken about&#xD;
      further action. REB and regulatory authorities will be notified immediately about the&#xD;
      decision taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication: All study medication is provided as a kind gift of Zentiva, ltd. Unblinded&#xD;
      study pharmacist will prepare into 40 mls of sterile water study medication, according to&#xD;
      patient's allocation into the treatment arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hydrochloroquine sulphate 200mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Azithromycin dihydrate 500mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lactose 500mg (Placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      See enclosed Specifications of Product characteristics. The medication will be administered&#xD;
      in covered Jeannete syringe into nasogastric tube (for patients unable to swallowed) or drunk&#xD;
      from a black mug by patients who are able to. In both cases at least 50 ml of water will be&#xD;
      used for flush. Treatment group allocation is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUP HC-A Azithromycin Hydrochloroquine HC Lactose Hydrochloroquine C Lactose Lactose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study patient will be given:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Patients receive two doses 400 mg of Hydrochloroquine or placebo in 12 hours&#xD;
           interval and 500 mg of Azithromycin or placebo once in 24 hours (with the first dose of&#xD;
           hydrochloroquine or placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 2-5: Patients receive two doses 200 mg of Hydrochloroquine or placebo in 12 hours&#xD;
           interval 250 mg of Azithromycin or placebo once in 24 hours (with the first dose of&#xD;
           hydrochloroquine or placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjusting IP administration to patients' swallowing capability and GI function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, 3 groups of patients will be enrolled. Those conscious and able to swallow&#xD;
      will be given study medication in black mug to swallow. Patients unable to swallow with a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube in place will be given the IP via the NG tube reconstituted in sterile water&#xD;
      and flushed as per local NG medication guideline. Administration of the IP is temporarily&#xD;
      omitted in patients who are unable to swallow but without NG access or do not tolerate any&#xD;
      enteral intake (such as patients in profound shock). As soon as the condition preventing IP&#xD;
      administration is eliminated, resumption of study medication follows the guidance for day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who&#xD;
      are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation at day 14 in the subgroup of patients without the need of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU-LOS D28 and D 90 mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary (exploratory) outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral load at D7 (No of viral RNA copies/ml of blood), proportion of patients alive and rtPCR&#xD;
      negative from nasal swab at D14, Difference of FiO2 ratio and respiratory system compliance&#xD;
      between day 0 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons: None at presents Sample&#xD;
      size calculation: Based on data from Wuhan and Washington, where 67% of patients were dead in&#xD;
      2 weeks and half of the survivors needed protracted mechanical ventilation, the assumed&#xD;
      incidence of the primary outcome in the control group (ie. being alive and off the ventilator&#xD;
      in 2 weeks) to be 25%. The study gives us 80% chance to detect the increase of the primary&#xD;
      outcome to 50% in one or both interventional groups at p&lt;0.017 with 74 patients in each arm.&#xD;
      In order to compensate for drop-out and low of follow up the plan is to enrol 240 subjects&#xD;
      into the study. An interim analysis is planned after the primary outcome is known for the&#xD;
      120th subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Will be performed in blocks of 3 and stratified for study centre and age&#xD;
      (above or at/below 70 years). Electronic Case Record Form (eCRF) will perform randomisation&#xD;
      using random sequence script in software R and generates medication code. Rationale:&#xD;
      Patient's age is single most powerful predictor of outcome and stratifying randomisation and&#xD;
      stratification decreases probability of treatment groups being of different age at baseline&#xD;
      by chance. In analogy, study centers may vary in the use of non-protocolised treatments,&#xD;
      which could bias the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to initiation of each centre, the central research coordinator will train the local&#xD;
      dedicated study personnel in the use of e-CRF and other study procedures. The medication will&#xD;
      be delivered in sealed numbered boxes and stored in ICUs. Adhering to Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      rules and guidelines is of upmost importance despite all the challenges during current&#xD;
      pandemic situation. Nonetheless, the eCRF has been designed to balance the safe conduct of&#xD;
      the clinical trial and feasibility of timely data entry during staff shortages and overload.&#xD;
      In order to do so, all data that is not essential for safety can be input in retrospect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection data on cointerventions. Data on interventions that the investigators know/think&#xD;
      influence survival will be monitored and described. This include concomitant antiviral&#xD;
      antimicrobial diagnosis. Data will also be collected on how the respiratory specimen for&#xD;
      rtPCR diagnostic was collected (smear, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Proportion of patients alive and off mechanical ventilation (primary&#xD;
      outcome) between intervention and control groups will be calculated using chi square test.&#xD;
      P-value is adjusted for multiple comparisons to p=0.017. Survival and ICU/length of stay will&#xD;
      be compared using Kaplan-Maier's curves and exploratory analyses my multi-level regression in&#xD;
      R. The plan is to analyse the primary outcome separately in patients who require mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation at baseline from those who don't and in patients above or below 70 years of age&#xD;
      as a priori subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, primary and secondary outcomes will only be calculated in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19 infection who received at least one dose of IP. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      calculated in all randomised patients (intention-to-treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Benefits and risks. This trial investigates two drugs that are being&#xD;
      used off label to treat patients with severe COVID-19 with a balance of potential benefits&#xD;
      and harms. Potential benefit include good biological rationale and observational data to&#xD;
      believe that one or both drugs can prevent progression of a disease which led to death in 67%&#xD;
      of patients in similar condition to those in this study. Possible harms include QT&#xD;
      prolongation and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias or retinopathy, which may result in&#xD;
      blindness. The investigators believe that clinical equipoise regarding risk/benefit to&#xD;
      individual patient justifies well the conduct of this RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedure. Patients with decision-making capacity will be asked to provide&#xD;
      written prospective informed consent (See Appendix I) to this protocol. It is expected that a&#xD;
      significant proportion of screened patients will lack the capacity to provide informed&#xD;
      consent due to altered consciousness, respiratory distress or sedation to facilitate&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. In this situation, the deferred consent policy will be applied as per&#xD;
      local law: independent physician will confirm in writing that the patient lacks capacity and&#xD;
      fulfils criteria. Then, patient himself/herself are approached to provide consent as soon as&#xD;
      they regain capacity. They are given options to continue in the study, to withdraw with&#xD;
      permission to use the data collected up to the point or to withdraw from the study and&#xD;
      request deleting all data collected. Patient next of kin plays no formal role as surrogate&#xD;
      decision maker as per Czech legislature. Nonetheless, the family will be informed when&#xD;
      practical about their relative's enrolment into the trial and the family will be offered an&#xD;
      information leaflet explaining the nature of the study. All serious adverse event that are&#xD;
      suspected from being related to study interventions will be reposted to Research Ethics Board&#xD;
      and regulatory authorities as per local legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules. All SUSARs will be reported to both REB and to the steering committee, who&#xD;
      may decide to stop the trial for safety concerns. Apart from safety, other reasons for&#xD;
      stopping the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Emergence of new data ( e.g. publication of the results of a big RCT) that may lead&#xD;
           continuation of the trial unethical. This may be due to safety concerns of placebo group&#xD;
           (in case strong clinical benefit is proven by other trial) or any of the interventional&#xD;
           groups (e.g. if harm is reported by other trials). This rule also applies for emergence&#xD;
           of a new treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After interim analysis: The steering committee will review primary outcomes and the&#xD;
           summary of adverse events in all 3 groups (labelled as A, B, C) whilst still blinded to&#xD;
           treatment allocation. The treatment can be stopped if the following criteria are&#xD;
           fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. There is a significant difference in the primary outcome at p&lt;0.017 in between the&#xD;
                groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Futility: The futility criterion is not binding for the steering committee. Based&#xD;
                on available data the study statistician calculates the probability of being able&#xD;
                to prove the null hypothesis with achieving the target number of subjects and the&#xD;
                probability of type II error made by stopping the trial prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Safety: In case the number of adverse events in one or more treatment groups is&#xD;
                find uneven or unacceptably high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replication of key aspects of trial methods and conduct. The trial is designed to be fully&#xD;
      reproducible in larger international multi-centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the sponsors This is investigator-initiated trial endorsed by Czech Society of&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and Intensive Care. The most significant resource for the study is unpaid&#xD;
      voluntary work of all the personnel conducting the study, who decided to do so in times of&#xD;
      worldwide pandemic crisis. Part of the resources were gathered from voluntary donors in a&#xD;
      crowdfunding campaign conducted by medical student association. Pharmaceutical company&#xD;
      Zentiva, ltd. was approached by investigators and kindly agreed to provide study medication&#xD;
      at no cost; however, it has had nor will have any role in study design; collection,&#xD;
      management, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or the decision to&#xD;
      submit the report for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results: The investigators will submit the main results of the trial in an&#xD;
      open-access peer-reviewed journal within 3 months after 240th subject completed the 90-day&#xD;
      follow up visit, which is expected to happen in Q4 of 2021. The investigators will make fully&#xD;
      de-identified record-level raw data available in a public database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial status: NOT YET RECRUITING (as of 1st April 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Declarations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design is in accordance with Declaration of Helsinky and the protocol, care report&#xD;
      form and informed consent formularies were reviewed and approved by FNKV University Hospital&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board (&quot;Ethical Committee&quot;) on 1st April 2020 (decision number KH&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult (&gt;18 years) within 24 hours of admission to intensive care unit with proven or&#xD;
             suspected COVID-19 infection. For the purpose of this study, intensive care unit is&#xD;
             defined as a facility that allow continuous monitoring of vital functions and oxygen&#xD;
             administration . It is expected that most patients will have rtPCR test known within&#xD;
             24 hours of admission to hospital. Nonetheless, if this is not the case (eg. due to&#xD;
             overloaded lab facility, lack of supplies) it is possible to randomise a patient based&#xD;
             on a strong clinical suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In case COVID-19 is not&#xD;
             confirmed in retrospect, experimental therapy is withdrawn and the study subject is&#xD;
             withdrawn from &quot;per protocol&quot; analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes, but&#xD;
             remains in &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; cohort for the analysis of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  symptoms of febrile disease for ≥1 week, pregnancy, treatment limitations in place or&#xD;
             moribund patients, allergy or intolerance of any study treatment, incl. long QT&#xD;
             syndromes, myasthenia gravis, allergies or known deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate&#xD;
             dehydrogenase, participation in another outcome-based interventional trial within last&#xD;
             30 days, patients taking Hydrochloroquine for other indication than COVID-19.&#xD;
