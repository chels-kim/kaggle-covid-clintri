  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the face of the quickly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many&#xD;
      health-care systems around the globe have modified their routine management of patients&#xD;
      presenting with acute cardiovascular emergencies including patients with ACS.A unifying theme&#xD;
      in the new management strategies is the adoption of new restrictive measures to meet the&#xD;
      challenges of increased risk of infection of health-care workers; limited numbers of beds,&#xD;
      shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate number of protected&#xD;
      catheterization rooms; and the clinical overlap between ACS and COVID-19 infection in some of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing countries, with an already strained health system due to economic problems, the&#xD;
      situation is more challenging and needs the formulation of efficient protocols that can&#xD;
      accommodate several medical and socioeconomic challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egypt, with an estimated population of 100 million, is facing exceptional challenges during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 crisis. Because large scale use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in a large population is a problem, the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in Egypt&#xD;
      is unknown. Furthermore, the supply of PPE falls far short of demands with lack of&#xD;
      professionally protected cardiac catheterization rooms. With progression of the pandemic in&#xD;
      such a large population, care of COVID-19 patients is expected to rapidly overwhelm the&#xD;
      supplies, beds, and staff available in Egyptian hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cardiology Department in Assiut university hospital has revised the management protocols&#xD;
      for ACS patients and implemented new management protocols both for patients with ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      (NSTE-ACS).&#xD;
