  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be a severe respiratory illness caused by Severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV2) for which there is no standard treatment in affected&#xD;
      persons nor a vaccine to prevent the infection. The investigators propose to test whether the&#xD;
      use of Convalescent plasma given to patients with severe COVID-19 disease will decrease risk&#xD;
      of death, decrease use of ventilatory support decrease biomarkers of inflammation and improve&#xD;
      measures of viral replication compared with controls subjects who were not&#xD;
      transfused.Convalescent plasma, will be collected from persons who are more than 21 days post&#xD;
      negative viral testing or 28 days post resolution of symptoms.&#xD;

      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be a severe respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      for which there is no standard treatment in affected persons nor a vaccine to prevent the&#xD;
      infection. This condition has and continues to cause significant burden on Health care&#xD;
      systems with affected persons needing prolonged stay on ventilators in Intensive Care Units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convalescent plasma has been used in the treatment of other life-threatening conditions such&#xD;
      as Novel Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, SARS-COV-1 epidemic and Middle East respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome -related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic. Since convalescent plasma has been found&#xD;
      to be beneficial in some diseases but is not always successful in all conditions in which it&#xD;
      has been tried, there is no guarantee of success in this disease, and so it is necessary to&#xD;
      conduct this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 30 patients with severe and life threatening COVID-19 disease will participate in&#xD;
      phase 2 clinical trials. Convalescent Plasma will be administered to participants fulfilling&#xD;
      the criteria due to its proven effect on H1N1 pandemic, SARS-COV-1 and MERS-COV epidemic.&#xD;
      Although it has proven beneficial in some diseases, there is no guarantee that it will bring&#xD;
      the desired outcome , hence the importance of the clinical trials. The observation will&#xD;
      consist of three groups, namely, donor, participants and a control group. These patients must&#xD;
      recover from all COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria will receive convalescent plasma,&#xD;
      collected from persons who are more than 21 days post negative viral testing or 28 days post&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms. Potential participants will be approached by a research assistant&#xD;
      within 24 hours of diagnosis and be told about the study and informed consent obtained only&#xD;
      after the participants are identified as meeting the inclusion criteria for either&#xD;
      participation as donor or recipient of plasma. If in the case of recipients, the recipients&#xD;
      are intubated or otherwise unable to give consent, the recipients proxy will be required to&#xD;
      do the same before participation is allowed. Plasma donations will also be solicited on the&#xD;
      University of the West Indies (UWI) and University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI)&#xD;
      websites and Mona Messaging platform of UWI as well as social media platforms that will be&#xD;
      managed by the UHWI public relations department. In addition, the investigators will also use&#xD;
      electronic news media publications to inform interested persons about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of the recipients plasma will be kept for future studies as yet unknown. If any of&#xD;
      these are genetic studies, attempts will be made to re-contact the donors to consent to these&#xD;
      studies. The duration for this first study will be for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recipients for this plasma infusion must fulfill criteria for severe or immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening infection. The control group will also fulfill the criteria for severe or&#xD;
      life-threatening disease but have a contraindication to receiving plasma. The plasma donors&#xD;
      must fulfill the criteria for selection of blood donors but in addition would have been&#xD;
      recovered from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will include changes in means of the objectives using Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned a study identification (ID) number and data linked to the&#xD;
      study ID will only be accessible to researchers using a password protected computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants name and study ID number will be kept in a locked filing cabinet with access&#xD;
      only to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a moderate risk study and participants will be informed that no personal benefit will&#xD;
      be derive from participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations include not getting enough persons for plasma donation if the infection rate in&#xD;
      Jamaica remains low, or the age of the affected persons is outside of the accepted range of&#xD;
      our blood donor requirements. As this is a pilot however, the investigators may be able to&#xD;
      achieve the sample size which should allow the investigators to identify any challenges in&#xD;
      conducting a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have every effort made to maintain confidentiality by using only study ID&#xD;
      numbers on data collection sheets and laboratory studies.&#xD;
