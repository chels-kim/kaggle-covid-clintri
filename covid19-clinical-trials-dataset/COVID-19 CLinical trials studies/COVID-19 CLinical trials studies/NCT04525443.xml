  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), secondary to infection by severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic with significant&#xD;
      adverse effects on the health, social and economic systems in different countries of the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entry receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2),&#xD;
      localized at the membrane of epithelial and endothelial cells and muscle cells of blood&#xD;
      vessels. Hypothetically, this interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with essential elements of the blood&#xD;
      vessels may conduct to endothelial dysfunction. In fact, it has been demonstrated several&#xD;
      degrees of endothelial compromise in the kidney, small bowel and lungs from histological&#xD;
      analysis in fatidic cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanisms by which vascular endothelial dysfunction can complicate&#xD;
      the evolutionary course of viral infections are of two types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On the one hand, acute endothelial dysfunction can produce ischemic events as a&#xD;
           consequence of thrombotic or vasomotor processes. Some of these events are acute&#xD;
           coronary syndromes, pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral angiopathy, all of which&#xD;
           have been reported in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the other hand, vascular endothelial dysfunction can trigger or amplify systemic&#xD;
           inflammatory reactions leading to multi-organ failure. Vascular hyperpermeability&#xD;
           generated by vascular endothelial dysfunction is key in the processes of infiltration of&#xD;
           immune cells and in the amplification of the inflammatory response that occurs in the&#xD;
           context of the cytokine storm associated with the viral infection. This process&#xD;
           contributes to release large amounts of IL 6, IL-1B and TNF alpha by vascular&#xD;
           endothelial cells, thus the expression of vascular adhesion molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we sought to investigate the status of vascular endothelial function in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients from a non-invasive approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of systemic vascular endothelial function will be performed non-invasively&#xD;
      using peripheral arterial tonometry with EndoPat system (Itamar). It is a technique that&#xD;
      determines the endothelial-dependent changes in arterial tone of the vascular network of the&#xD;
      index finger of both hands. Using bio-sensors placed on the pad of the index finger of both&#xD;
      hands, an assessment of arterial tone is carried out at three stages: 1) at baseline; 2)&#xD;
      during an ischemia caused by the inflation of a pressure cuff in one of the arms to occlude&#xD;
      the brachial artery for 5 minutes; 3) and in a situation of reactive hyperemia during the&#xD;
      recovery of arterial irrigation after deflating the pressure cuff. The arterial tone signals&#xD;
      detected by plethysmography at the three described times are converted into digital signals&#xD;
      for each arm explored, and the EndoPat software automatically determines the hyperemic&#xD;
      vascular response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid biases in the analysis of systemic vascular endothelial function in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients, the research team led by Dr. Amir Lerman from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA will&#xD;
      blindly carry out the analysis of the EndoPat results. For this, the EndoPat study reports&#xD;
      will be sent in an analyzable format for each patient included in the study, completely&#xD;
      anonymized and at blind fashion with respect to the group that patient belongs, the moment in&#xD;
      which EndoPat assessment was made (days from the onset of symptoms in the case of the study&#xD;
      group), blinded for the results of blood tests related to inflammation, and for the clinical&#xD;
      evolution of the patient.&#xD;
