  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On Dec 31, 2019, a number of viral pneumonia cases were reported in China. The virus causing&#xD;
      pneumonia was then identified as a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Since this time, the&#xD;
      infection called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world, causing&#xD;
      huge stress for health care systems. To diagnose this infection, throat and nose swabs are&#xD;
      taken. Unfortunately, the results often take more than 24 hrs to return from a laboratory.&#xD;
      Speeding diagnosis up would be of great help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to look at the breath to find signs that might allow clinicians to diagnose&#xD;
      the coronavirus infection at the bedside, without needing to send samples to the laboratory.&#xD;
      To do this, the team will be using a machine called a BreathSpec which has been adapted to&#xD;
      fit in the hospital for this purpose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is of increasing interest in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of lung infection. Over 2,000 VOCs can be detected through gas chromatography&#xD;
      and mass spectrometry (GC-MS); patterns of VOC detected can offer information on chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer and interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, GC-MS while highly sensitive cannot be done at the bedside and at best takes&#xD;
      hours to prepare samples, run the analysis and then interpret the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with other methods of breath analysis, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) offers a&#xD;
      tenfold higher detection rate of VOCs. By coupling an ion mobility spectrometer with a GC&#xD;
      column, GC-IMS offers immediate twofold separation of VOCs with visualisation in a&#xD;
      three-dimensional chromatogram. The total analysis time is about 300 seconds and the&#xD;
      equipment has been miniaturised to allow bedside analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BreathSpec machine has been previously used to study both radiation injury in patients&#xD;
      undergoing radiotherapy at the Edinburgh Cancer Centre (REC ref 16-SS-0059, as part of the&#xD;
      H2020 TOXI-triage project, http://www.toxi-triage.eu/) and pneumonia in patients presenting&#xD;
      to the ED of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (REC ref 18-LO-1029). This work has developed&#xD;
      artificial intelligence methodology that allows rapid analysis of the vast amount of data&#xD;
      collected from these breath samples to identify signatures that may indicate a particular&#xD;
      pathological process such as pneumonia or radiation injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOXI-triage project showed that the BreathSpec GC-IMS could rapidly triage individuals to&#xD;
      identify those who had been exposed to particular volatile liquids in a mass casualty&#xD;
      situation (http://www.toxi-triage.eu/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot trial assessed chest infections at the Acute Medical Unit of the Royal Liverpool&#xD;
      University Hospital. The final diagnostic model permitted fair discrimination between&#xD;
      bacterial chest infections and chest infections due to other agents with an area under the&#xD;
      receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.86). The summary test&#xD;
      characteristics were a sensitivity of 62% (95% CI 41-80%) and specificity of 80% (95% CI 64 -&#xD;
      91%) [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was expanded in the EU H2020 funded &quot;Breathspec Study&quot; which aimed to differentiate&#xD;
      breath samples from patients with bacterial or viral upper or lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection. Over 1220 patients were recruited, with 191 patients identified as definitely&#xD;
      bacterial infection and 671 classed as definitely not bacterial. Virology was undertaken on&#xD;
      all patients, with 259 patients confirmed viral infection. Date processing is still on going&#xD;
      to determine how well they can be distinguished using this methodology. More than 100&#xD;
      patients were recruited to this study in Edinburgh. Since then, artificial intelligence has&#xD;
      been incorporated into our analytical processes, permitting faster and more refined analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our ambition is that this technology will identify a signature of Covid-19 pneumonia or&#xD;
      within 10 min in non-invasively collected breath samples to allow triage of patients into&#xD;
      high and low risk categories for Covid-19. This will allow targeting of scarce resources and&#xD;
      complex protocols associated with high risk patients including personal protective equipment&#xD;
      (PPE), cohorting, and dedicated medical and nursing personel.&#xD;
