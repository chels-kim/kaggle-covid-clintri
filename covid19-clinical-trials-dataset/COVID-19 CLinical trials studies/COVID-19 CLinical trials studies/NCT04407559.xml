  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the Covid-19 worldwide outbreak, fragile patients with immune diseases, notably&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have to be even more specifically and carefully followed-up.&#xD;
      However, it has been shown that false postive serological results often occured while&#xD;
      detecting antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with positive rheumatodoid&#xD;
      factor (RF). The investigators propose here to investigated this issue. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will test three different immunoassays on this specific population. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to establish these assays specificity and the levels of RF for which there&#xD;
      is a risk of anti-SARS-CoV-2 false positivity and thus ensure a better follow-up of RA&#xD;
      patients. The RF isotype will be analysed to determine whether there is a correlation and the&#xD;
      impact of the presence of anti-CCP (citrullinated cyclic antipeptide antibodies) will be&#xD;
      studied and assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatism, affecting 0.5% to 1% of&#xD;
      the European population. Characterized by symmetrical and distal erosive polyarthritis, its&#xD;
      diagnosis is based on the association of the clinical assessment combined with the presence&#xD;
      of a chronic biological inflammatory syndrome and of citrullinated cyclic antipeptide&#xD;
      antibodies (CCP) and / or of rheumatoid factor. From a prognostic point of view, some factors&#xD;
      allow the risk prediction of the progression to structural damage (bone erosion), such as the&#xD;
      positivity of the rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and require the rapid&#xD;
      introduction of basic immunosuppressive therapy or biotherapy. In the context of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, responsible for the COVID-19 disease, the interest of a serological test&#xD;
      is essential from an epidemiological point of view in order to follow the evolution of the&#xD;
      pandemic, and to adapt the strategy of de-confinement of the general population or of&#xD;
      patients at risk. However, RA patients receiving biotherapy present an increased risk of&#xD;
      infection. In this context of de-confinement, a SARS-CoV-2 serological analysis, before&#xD;
      initiating RA patients future treatment or in order to adapt their current treatment, would&#xD;
      be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by various detection kits is currently&#xD;
      under evaluation. To the lack of serological test kits on the French market is added the&#xD;
      complexity of verifying the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. On the other hand,&#xD;
      the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is complex and still quite unknown. The concomitant&#xD;
      presence of several isotypes IgA, IgM and IgG is frequently observed. Thus, the isotypic&#xD;
      switching of Ig does not seem to take place correctly in this disease case, which randers the&#xD;
      serodiagnostics even more complicated to implement. Detection of the less specific IgMs would&#xD;
      therefore be essential, in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (Ig), more often of the M type, directed against the Fc fragment of IgG. This&#xD;
      antibody, although not directly pathogenic, is very frequently present in RA patients (70 to&#xD;
      80%), without being specific for this pathology since it can be observed in other autoimmune,&#xD;
      infectious or hematological diseases as well. The presence of RF IgM, all the more in high&#xD;
      titers, is problematic while performing many serological or immunological assays since these&#xD;
      high levels can be responsible for false positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During previous SARS epidemics (SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV), false positive results of&#xD;
      serological tests were observed. When detecting anti-SARS-CoV-1 IgG or IgM in patients who&#xD;
      had not contracted SARS, the use of an ELISA kit, with plates coated with a cell lysate of&#xD;
      Vero-E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-1, had been shown to induce a low number of false&#xD;
      positive results in healthy controls (less than 5%). However, the number of false positive&#xD;
      results in patients with autoimmune diseases was much higher, and varied accordingly with the&#xD;
      pathology (between 10% and 58%), the largest number of false positive results being obtained&#xD;
      in lupus patients. This phenomenon can be explained by the use of an immune test using&#xD;
      unpurified cell lysates, which contain antigens against which the autoantibodies present in&#xD;
      the patient serum could react, thus distorting the outcome of the test. Other causes of&#xD;
      increase in the false positive results rate have been described when performing SARS-CoV-1&#xD;
      serologies, such as the presence of active neoplasia, or because of a previous infection with&#xD;
      another coronavirus. Indeed, other coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, display a&#xD;
      nucleocapsid close to the one of SARS-CoV-1 : this similarity can be the source of&#xD;
      cross-reactivity. The same phenomenon was observed with the latest coronavirus: it was&#xD;
      therefore suggested to rather use recombinant antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in immunoassays, such as&#xD;
      ELISA for instance Given the similarity between SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2, it is likely that&#xD;
      the various elements causing false positive results during serological tests for SARS-CoV-1,&#xD;
      in particular the presence of auto-antibodies including RF, could also cause false positive&#xD;
      results when performing serological tests targeting SARS-CoV-2. A recent Chinese study showed&#xD;
      that a moderate or high rate of RF was associated with a significant rate of false positive&#xD;
      results when searching for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM with a ELISA kit, which plates were however&#xD;
      coated with recombinant antigen. The authors therefore proposed to include a urea&#xD;
      dissociation step into the ELISA protocol, which seemed to improve the specificity of the&#xD;
      test, without altering its sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It thus appears essential to assess the influence of RF, for its different isotypes (IgG,&#xD;
      IgM, IgA), on various serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 available in France, in order to&#xD;
      better assess these tests specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate and compare 3 different serological tests available for&#xD;
      the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. The rate of false positive results obtained&#xD;
      for each type of test will be evaluated on sera originated from patients with RA who have&#xD;
      never been in contact with SARS-CoV-2, since these sera were withdrawn before July 2019. The&#xD;
      relation between the incidence of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays false positive results and RF&#xD;
      antibody levels could be estimated, as well as the characterization of RF.&#xD;
