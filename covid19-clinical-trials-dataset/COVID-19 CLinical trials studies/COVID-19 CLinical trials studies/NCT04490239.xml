  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating the tolerability of Heparin Sodium (porcine) administered&#xD;
      topically via a nasal spray. This agent is being investigated as a potential prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment to prevent infection by SARS(severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2, the novel&#xD;
      coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Heparin Sodium (porcine) is an FDA-approved anticoagulant&#xD;
      drug administered by injection. Recent work from multiple groups have found that heparin can&#xD;
      prevent the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2, indicating a possible use as a topical&#xD;
      anti-viral. Numerous studies in both rodent models and humans have shown that heparin&#xD;
      administered via a pulmonary or intranasal route enters the blood stream in negligible&#xD;
      amounts, suggesting intranasal administration of heparin should be safe even at very large&#xD;
      doses. Data from mouse models indicate that repeated daily nasal administration of heparin&#xD;
      had no adverse effects in mice over a two week period (including weight loss, nose bleeds,&#xD;
      loss of sense of smell, nasal discharge, or decreased blood clotting time). However, no data&#xD;
      of repeated nasal administration of heparin in humans is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test nasal administration of FDA-approved heparin sodium (porcine),&#xD;
      originally formulated for injection. The formulations the investigators will be testing&#xD;
      consist of heparin, sodium chloride, and 1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative bottled in a&#xD;
      nasal sprayer dispensing 0.1 mL(millilitres) per spray. The investigation is planned in two&#xD;
      phases. A single-dose phase will test the acute tolerability of the drug. In this phase,&#xD;
      subjects will be administered 0.1 mL of Heparin Sodium in each nostril formulated at one of&#xD;
      two doses: Day 1 will test a formulation of 5000 U(units)/mL, and Day 2 will test a&#xD;
      formulation of 10000 U(units) /mL. After each dose, subjects will be tested for systemic&#xD;
      exposure via blood aPTT tests and platelet count, as well as for local topical toxicity via&#xD;
      examination for epistaxis and anosmia, along with any other adverse events. In the chronic&#xD;
      phase, subjects will be administered the highest dose that was tolerated in the acute phase&#xD;
      daily for fourteen days. Subjects will be tested for aPTT and platelet count, as well as&#xD;
      epistaxis, anosmia and any other adverse events.&#xD;

      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory clinical trial is designed to assess tolerability of increasing doses of&#xD;
      intranasally administered heparin sodium in saline solution. Baseline values for aPTT and&#xD;
      complete blood count will be obtained from six subjects. Heparin will be administered in&#xD;
      increasing concentrations using one 0.1 mL(millilitre) spray per nostril (0.2 ml total) on a&#xD;
      daily basis. Major signs of toxicity will be clinically relevant changes in aPTT time,&#xD;
      clinically relevant decrease in platelet count, signs of anosmia 30 minutes after&#xD;
      administration, or epistaxis. Dosing will start at 1000 units of heparin administered (500&#xD;
      units in each nostril) and then escalated to 2000 units. Should a clinically relevant aPTT&#xD;
      prolongation (&gt;50% increase from subject baseline) or decrease in platelet count (below&#xD;
      clinical lab normal limit) be observed at either dose, the study will be halted and a series&#xD;
      of lower doses evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Design of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center, prospective, Phase 0 exploratory tolerability trial. A total&#xD;
      of 6 healthy subjects (3 M and 3 F) will be enrolled into the study. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the acute and multi-day (14 days) tolerability of intranasally administered heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Article&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the single and multi-dose tolerability of intranasal administration of&#xD;
      an aliquot of an FDA-approved heparin sodium injection (5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP&#xD;
      units/mL) to deliver 1000U (units) or 2000U of heparin sodium. Doses will be prepared and&#xD;
      administered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL(milliliter) of 5000U(units)/mL or one spray of 500 U in each nostril)&#xD;
      2000 U = (2 x 0.1 mL of 10000U/mL or one spray of 1000 U in each nostril)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test article will be administered by transferring (4 mL) of sterile heparin sodium&#xD;
      injection (5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL) at ambient room temperature into&#xD;
      intranasal spray bottles, one for each individual subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test article will be administered within 4 weeks of preparation, and the remainder&#xD;
      discarded after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplier The test article (Heparin Sodium USP) will be obtained from appropriate commercial&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be completed as part of this single and multi-dose, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study. Safety will be assessed prior to test article administration and at 24 post dose, in&#xD;
      the acute phase. For safety assessments during the chronic phase, safety assessments will be&#xD;
      assessed prior to test article administration , day 14 and day 15-post study. Test subject&#xD;
      will be called every three (3) days for updates and subjective reports (adverse events),&#xD;
      during 14 day, daily dose phase. Subject safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse&#xD;
      events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters will be evaluated during screening and daily, to include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Blood Count (WBC, RBC(red blood cell count), Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, MCV (mean&#xD;
           corpuscular volume), Platelet Count)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PT(prothrombin time)/INR (international normalized ratio) Baseline and post study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum/Urine hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin)baseline and predose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Adverse Events will be monitored throughout the study. However, such events are not&#xD;
      anticipated during this trial due to the low systemic exposure of the test article being&#xD;
      administered. However, local side effects of intranasal heparin, such as epistaxis or nasal&#xD;
      congestion may result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any abnormal lab values, test subjects will be evaluated for any sign and symptoms, and&#xD;
      labs will be redrawn, until stabilized or returned to baseline. Subjects will be referred to&#xD;
      the primary physician for any continued care required.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be administered heparin sodium (porcine) bottled in a nasal sprayer with a volume per spray of 0.1 mL.&#xD;
Acute phase:&#xD;
On day 1, each subject will be administered 0.1 mL per nostril of 5000 U/mL heparin sodium (porcine), for a total dose of 1000 U. Vital signs, blood work, and follow-up clinical observation will be used to detect adverse effects.&#xD;
On day 2, each subject will be administered 0.1 mL per nostril of 10000 U/mL heparin sodium (porcine), for a total dose of 2000 U. Vital signs, blood work, and follow-up clinical observation will be used to detect adverse effects.&#xD;
Chronic phase:&#xD;
The highest acute dose that has no impact on aPTT or INR will be used for the chronic phase of this study. Each subject will be administered a daily dose for fourteen days. The first and last dose will be administered in the clinic; all other doses will be self-administered by subjects at home at the same time of day using a dosing diary to keep records.</description>
