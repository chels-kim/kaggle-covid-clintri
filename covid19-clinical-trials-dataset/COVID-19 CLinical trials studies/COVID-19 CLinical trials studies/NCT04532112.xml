  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess use of a biocontainment device for planned airway&#xD;
      procedures under general anesthesia. This will serve as a platform for using this device as a&#xD;
      novel biocontainment and aerosol evacuation system as part of rapid sequence intubation&#xD;
      protocols for COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that airway procedures with the aerosol&#xD;
      biocontainment device will be safe and effective with airway procedure times approaching&#xD;
      times for airway procedures without the device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site (two sites), unblinded, randomized, observational study performed in a&#xD;
      controlled environment in the operating room. The hypothesis is that rapid sequence&#xD;
      intubation or other urgent airway procedures performed with the biocontainment device will be&#xD;
      safe and can be performed in an equivalent manner to urgent airway procedures without the&#xD;
      biocontainment device. Methods to minimize bias include randomizing patients to intubation&#xD;
      with or without the biocontainment device.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention consists of a biocontainment and aerosol clearance device that will be tested in the controlled setting to assess feasibility to perform airway procedures under general anesthesia with the device. There is no specific control device for this product. The control condition for this intervention will consist of airway procedures per routine clinical protocols without the biocontainment device. This study will be performed initially in locations where a patient would undergo a scheduled airway procedure under general anesthesia on non-COVID-19 patients. All participants in this study as well as non-participants who are present in the room during the airway procedure (aerosol-generating procedure) will continue to use appropriate level of PPE per hospital protocols and policies. This device does not replace standard aerosol-protecting PPE.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention consists of a biocontainment and aerosol evacuation device (Biobox) that will be placed around a patient prior to the airway procedure and remain in place throughout the airway procedure. The Biobox device is manufactured by National Flag and consists of a re-useable frame with a disposable, plastic torso drape. This is a new device that has not been used previously in a healthcare setting.</description>
