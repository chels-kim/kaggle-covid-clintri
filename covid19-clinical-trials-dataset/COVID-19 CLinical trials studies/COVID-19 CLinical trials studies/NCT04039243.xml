    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of intervening with&#xD;
      2-year-old children with elevated temperamental Fear and/or Shyness or 3-year-old children&#xD;
      with elevated anxiety and their parents, using a parent-child Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) protocol to reduce anxiety disorders and maintain reduced anxiety at one-year&#xD;
      follow-up. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, study visits and treatment sessions were conducted&#xD;
      in office. Now all visits and treatment sessions are conducted remotely.&#xD;
