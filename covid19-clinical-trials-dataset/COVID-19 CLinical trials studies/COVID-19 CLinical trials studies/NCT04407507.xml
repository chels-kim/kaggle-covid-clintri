  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Ivermectin in patients&#xD;
      with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the rate of progression to severe 2019 novel coronavirus&#xD;
      disease (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with a disease control status&#xD;
      defined as no progression of severe disease Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference between&#xD;
      group A (ivermectin + paracetamol) and group B (ivermectin + paracetamol) in terms of the&#xD;
      primary endpoint on day 14.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, an unidentified viral pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China. Later, it was&#xD;
      declared that it was pneumonia due to a new coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      officially called it COVID-19 disease (Xie and Chen 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent, developed to combat parasitic worms in&#xD;
      veterinary use and in human medicine. This compound has been used orally in humans to treat&#xD;
      filariasis, but is also effective against other worm-associated infections, as well as&#xD;
      parasitic skin diseases and insect infections. It is approved for human use in several&#xD;
      countries, to treat onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, strongyloidiasis, and scabies, and&#xD;
      recently in capillary pediculosis. When avermectins were discovered, they represented a new&#xD;
      class of compounds that kill various ranges of disease-causing organisms, as well as pathogen&#xD;
      vectors, inside and outside the body. Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic mixture of two&#xD;
      chemically modified avermectins, comprising 80% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1 and 20%&#xD;
      22,23-dihydroavermectin-B1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other diseases that have been treated with ivermectin are: trichinosis, vector insects,&#xD;
      malaria, trypanosomiasis, allergic asthma, rosacea, bedbugs, schistosomiasis, chagas disease,&#xD;
      epilepsy, neurological diseases. Furthermore, it has been observed to have effects as an&#xD;
      antibiotic and anticancer (Crump 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In turn, Ivermectin has been described as a broad-spectrum antiviral, inhibiting nuclear&#xD;
      import by its ability to inactivate host nuclear transport proteins, such as integrase and&#xD;
      nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), limiting the ability to infect the western virus of the Nile&#xD;
      in low concentrations (Yang et al. 2020), as well as inhibiting the replication of the yellow&#xD;
      fever virus and other flaviviruses, such as dengue, and encephalitis, probably attacking the&#xD;
      activity of nonstructural helicase 3 (Crump 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin, at a dose of 150-200 mcg / kg, is the first line of treatment for river blind&#xD;
      disease (onchocerca volvulus), lymphatic filariasis, and strongyloidiasis(Crump 2017)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      French authorities approved ivermectin for humans in 1987. Shortly thereafter, Merck &amp; Co Inc&#xD;
      donated ivermectin for onchocerciasis control. Since then, more than two billion treatments&#xD;
      have been distributed in Africa and Latin America for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis&#xD;
      (Chaccour et al. 2013; Smit et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, ivermectin adverse events have been mild, transient and associated with the&#xD;
      intensity of the infection. No significant association was found between ivermectin plasma&#xD;
      levels and adverse events(Merck &amp; Co 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wagstaff et al. published preliminary studies in in vitro cultures, where they observed that&#xD;
      a 5000-fold reduction in the viral RNA content of cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,&#xD;
      treated with a single dose of ivermectin (Caly et al. 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin therapy has not been tested in COVID-19 subjects and is therefore intended to be&#xD;
      used as an adjuvant treatment; therefore, all study subjects will receive ivermectin or&#xD;
      placebo in addition to therapy that their treating physician deems appropriate. Since&#xD;
      ivermectin is in an early phase of clinical development, the use of base therapy will ensure&#xD;
      that all subjects, including subjects who are randomized to receive placebo, have the benefit&#xD;
      of receiving treatment with the base therapy that is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ivermectin in patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the rate of&#xD;
      progression to severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify the replication rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at days 5 and 14 after diagnosis&#xD;
           quantitatively by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the presence and frequency of symptoms associated with COVID-19 disease (fever,&#xD;
           cough, myalgia, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea, and expectoration)&#xD;
           daily for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the presence of adverse events associated or not with the study drug for 14&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for associations between the morbidities of the evaluated subjects and the&#xD;
           intensity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for a relationship between medical history of bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG)&#xD;
           vaccines and the intensity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the frequency of death in the subjects, associated with COVID-19.&#xD;
