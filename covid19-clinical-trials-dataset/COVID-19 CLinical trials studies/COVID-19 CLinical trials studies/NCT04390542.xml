  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which of two approaches is helpful to support&#xD;
      caregivers of patients undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) or Chimeric&#xD;
      Antigen Receptors (CAR) T-cell therapy at Seidman Cancer Center. This study will take start&#xD;
      before you begin treatment until 2 months after your hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a two-group, randomized pilot study to test the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      usability, satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of a behavioral (psychoeducation)&#xD;
      intervention, as compared to a usual care (information from healthcare providers) control&#xD;
      group, on caregiver outcomes. The control and intervention groups will receive the standard&#xD;
      University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center (SCC) binder of relevant information regarding&#xD;
      care of the patient undergoing HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy. This information will be given to&#xD;
      the caregiver by the health care provider. In addition, the intervention group will receive 6&#xD;
      individual sessions with an interventionist during all phases of HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy.&#xD;
      The independent variable is group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      psycho-educational intervention designed for caregivers of patients receiving HSCT (allogenic&#xD;
      or autologous) or CAR T-cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to explore the usability, satisfaction and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a psycho-educational intervention designed for caregivers of patients&#xD;
      receiving HSCT (allogenic or autologous) or CAR T-cell therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Average acceptability scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post-hospital discharge, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability, as measured by average acceptability scale scores, with overall score ranging from 6-30. According to prior research, a score of 80% of higher (total score of 24 or higher) is considered acceptable for use.</description>

    <measure>Average System Usability Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post-hospital discharge, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Usability, as measured by average System Usability Scale scores. This is a 10 item scale scored on a 5 point Likert scale with total summed scores ranging from 0-50. Total scores are multiplied by 2 to produce an overall score ranging from 0-100 with scores &gt; 68 considered to be above average usability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean caregiver satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post-hospital discharge, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver satisfaction will be evaluated by having caregivers evaluate their satisfaction with each of the 6 modules at the end of each module. After completing each module, they will be sent via REDCap a single item evaluation scale (0 -10; 0=Not at all satisfied; 10=Highly satisfied). Scores &gt;7 will be considered acceptable. Mean and standard deviation to describe subjects' overall satisfaction with the intervention reported.</description>

    <description>Distress as measured by the NCCN distress thermometer. Thermometer scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse distress.&#xD;
Prior to administration of the distress thermometer measure, each caregiver will be asked if they are experiencing distress related to Covid-19 (yes/no). The distress thermometer asking them to rate their distress in the past week including today. The Covid-19 variable will be included as a covariate in the analyses.&#xD;
