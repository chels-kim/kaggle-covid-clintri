  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently involving all parts of the&#xD;
      world. Several risk factors for critical illness and death from the disease have been&#xD;
      proposed. However, it is still unclear if the observed associations between different&#xD;
      comorbidities and chronic medications and severe COVID-19 disease and mortality is different&#xD;
      from associations between the same factors and other severe diseases requiring intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) -care. This is important since some of the observed risk factors are very common&#xD;
      in the aged who, by age alone, are more prone to a more severe course of any disease. By&#xD;
      combining several registries, this study will compare, on several comorbidities such as&#xD;
      hypertension and diabetes , the first 2000 cases of COVID-19 patients receiving critical care&#xD;
      in Sweden to a Swedish sepsis-cohort and a Swedish adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      -cohort.&#xD;

        The SIR is a registry to which all Swedish intensive care units are reporting all intensive&#xD;
        care patients. The SIR has a specific part to wich all COVID-19 related intensive care&#xD;
        eposodes are reported. All patients, approximally 2000, who have at least one COVID-19&#xD;
        listing in the SIRI will be included, as cases. Two historical control populations are&#xD;
        extracted from the SIR between 2011 and 2016. One population with all patients having had&#xD;
        severe sepsis and one with all patients having had ARDS during ICU care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We already have recieved all data on the studypopulation and the Control populations but&#xD;
        will not set up the database or perform any analyses until this registration is be public.&#xD;
