      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Viral infections are an important cause of illness and death in hospitalized patients as&#xD;
      well as outpatients. New strains of viruses may appear and infect both healthy people and&#xD;
      those with weak immune systems. A better understanding of these new virus strains (such as&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) may help to control and prevent these infections.&#xD;
      In particular, some viral infections that are less problematic in healthy persons can be life&#xD;
      threatening in persons with weak immune systems, and viruses may be able to evolve more&#xD;
      rapidly in persons with weak immune systems and therefore develop resistance to existing&#xD;
      treatments. Researchers are interested in collecting samples and information from otherwise&#xD;
      healthy persons or persons with weak immune systems to study the effects of viruses and their&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect samples and data from individuals who have been exposed to or have contracted&#xD;
      viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of all ages who have been diagnosed with a viral infection are suspected to&#xD;
           have a viral infection, or have been in close contact with someone with a suspected or&#xD;
           actual viral infection that is of interest to investigators in the Laboratory of&#xD;
           Infectious Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy persons and persons with weak immune systems (immunocompromised individuals) are&#xD;
           eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be pre-screened to determine if they meet the eligibility criteria for&#xD;
           the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If eligible, evaluation may include a medical chart review, a history and physical&#xD;
           examination, review of clinical reports from outside hospitals and laboratories, and&#xD;
           review of tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study procedures may include collection of blood, urine, saliva, nasal fluid sampling,&#xD;
           throat swabs, stool, and genital swabs. For participants who have specimens collected as&#xD;
           part of their medical care (e.g. wound swabs, spinal tap, bronchoscopy, liver biopsy&#xD;
           etc.), researchers may use leftover specimens from the clinical laboratory for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specimens may be collected up to 4 times per week during the first 2 weeks after&#xD;
           enrollment, and then as many as 2 times per week for up to 2 years. Some participants&#xD;
           may be asked to continue providing specimens if there is concern for relapse or&#xD;
           recurrence of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment is not offered under this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      as well as out-patients. New strains of viruses may appear and cause epidemics in healthy&#xD;
      persons or immunocompromised persons. A better understanding of these new virus strains may&#xD;
      help to control and prevent these infections. Some viral infections that would otherwise be&#xD;
      asymptomatic or cause mild disease can be life threatening in immunocompromised persons.&#xD;
      Immunocompromised persons often shed high titers of virus for prolonged periods of time. In&#xD;
      the absence of a potent immune system, viruses may evolve more rapidly in their hosts.&#xD;
      Therefore, analysis of sequential virus specimens from these patients can provide information&#xD;
      on virus evolution, including how resistance to antiviral agents can develop. In addition,&#xD;
      higher titers of virus may be associated with virus mutants that are more adapted to grow in&#xD;
      cell culture. In this protocol we will obtain specimens containing viruses from otherwise&#xD;
      healthy or immunocompromised patients over sequential periods of time to study their nucleic&#xD;
      acid sequences, sensitivity to antiviral agents, cell types infected by the virus, and&#xD;
      ability to grow in cell culture. In some cases we weill review tissue biosies or clinical&#xD;
      reports from outside laboratories to assist with the diagnosis of virus-associated diseases.&#xD;
      We will also record the patient s signs and symptoms, note results of any pertinent&#xD;
      laboratory work-up, and in some cases, obtain blood to measure immune responses, isolate&#xD;
      antibodies, or virus-specific T cells, or to look for viremia. This study should provide&#xD;
      further understanding on how viruses evolve in their natural hosts, how they become resistant&#xD;
      to antiviral agents, how antibody responses evolve to viruses, and might allow some currently&#xD;
      uncultivatable viruses to be grown in cell culture.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The protocol is open to people of all ages:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i. Only patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age can be enrolled at the&#xD;
                  Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ii. Patients who are &lt; 2 years old may be enrolled only remotely and will not be&#xD;
                  seen at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Must have (or be suspected of having) a viral infection, that is of interest to&#xD;
                  LID investigators. Alternatively, must be a close contact of someone who has (or&#xD;
                  is suspected of having) a viral infection that is of interest to LID&#xD;
                  investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adults who are unable to provide initial consent may be enrolled providing&#xD;
                  procedures per Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) standard operation&#xD;
                  procedure (SOP) 14E have been followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are unable to safely undergo study procedures and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients unwilling to have samples collected and stored for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Children:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Children younger than 2 years of age will be enrolled only remotely from non-NIH&#xD;
             medical facilities and will not be seen at the Clinical Center, because children of&#xD;
             this age are susceptible to viral infections, some of which are more likely to occur&#xD;
             in this very young population or could be more severe. Title 45 of the United States&#xD;
             Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46 Subpart D and (OHRSPHRPP SOP 14D) will be&#xD;
             followed to comply with research involving children. The proposed research poses a&#xD;
             risk no greater than that encountered with blood tests or other minimally invasive&#xD;
             tests ordered as part of a routine history and physical examination. The PI will&#xD;
             ensure that appropriate permission from each child s parent(s) or guardian has been&#xD;
             obtained for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Pregnant Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Pregnant women are eligible to participate in this study as they are susceptible to&#xD;
             viral infections, some of which may be more severe in this patient population. This&#xD;
             study provides an opportunity to learn more about viral infections in pregnant women.&#xD;
             This information may be meaningful in informing disease severity, clinical practice&#xD;
             for treating pregnant women, or in leading to new treatments for this population. This&#xD;
             information cannot be gained without the participation of pregnant women. The primary&#xD;
             procedure performed under this protocol is a blood draw but other procedures may be&#xD;
             performed and are considered minimal risk in clinical practice. No procedures that&#xD;
             would affect a developing fetus or affect a baby through breastfeeding are performed&#xD;
             in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Decisionally Impaired Adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are eligible to enroll. Also&#xD;
             adults who lose the ability to provide on-going consent subsequent to giving initial&#xD;
             consent may continue to participate. These adults are susceptible to viral infections&#xD;
             and we can learn about viral infections that may occur in this population.&#xD;
             Institutionalized adults will not be enrolled. The procedures utilized are clinically&#xD;
             considered to be of minimal risk&#xD;
