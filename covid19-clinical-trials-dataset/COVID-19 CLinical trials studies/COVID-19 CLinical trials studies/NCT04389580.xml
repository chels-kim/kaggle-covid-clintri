      Combination Therapy with Isotretinoin and Tamoxifen expected to provide Complete Protection&#xD;
      against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over&#xD;
      150,000 deaths.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and for which there are currently no&#xD;
      approved treatments.The principal investigator reported according to previous research data&#xD;
      that combination therapy with Isotretinoin and tamoxifen expected to provide Complete&#xD;
      Protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, ACE2-expressing cells can&#xD;
      act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular&#xD;
      viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often&#xD;
      treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which&#xD;
      have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression, In another study by Sinha et al&#xD;
      who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic&#xD;
      profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was&#xD;
      the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in&#xD;
      CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19&#xD;
      (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1)&#xD;
      Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease&#xD;
      (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the&#xD;
      proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual&#xD;
      ligand screening. As Investigators discussed before in their previous clinical trial&#xD;
      (NCT04353180) that Isotretinoin is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. and the principal&#xD;
      investigator expects that Isotretinoin can inhibit or downrgulat ACE2 by direct interaction&#xD;
      and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing&#xD;
      the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell. The second combined drug is tamoxifen, A study&#xD;
      demonstrated that tamoxifen causes redistribution of weak base chemotherapeutics from acidic&#xD;
      organelles to the nucleus in drug-resistant cells. Agents that disrupt organelle&#xD;
      acidification (e.g., monensin, bafilomycin A1) cause a similar redistribution. Measurement of&#xD;
      cellular pH in several cell lines reveals that tamoxifen inhibits acidification of endosomes&#xD;
      and lysosomes without affecting cytoplasmic pH, Tamoxifen decreased the rate of vesicular&#xD;
      transport though the recycling and secretory pathways. Organellar acidification is required&#xD;
      for many cellular functions, and its disruption could account for many of the side effects of&#xD;
      tamoxifen. A sudy demonstrated that the phagocytosis is inhabited by tamoxifen and&#xD;
      chloroquine in retinal epithelial cells and Also, a study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have&#xD;
      weak base property and increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics. Importantly,&#xD;
      TAM treatment enhanced survival of mice injected with a lethal dose of STx1 or STx2,The&#xD;
      protective effect was independent of estrogen receptors but dependent on the weak base&#xD;
      property of TAM, which allowed TAM to increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics.&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have antimalarial effect via treating mice infected with&#xD;
      P. berghei, which show lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of cerebral&#xD;
      malaria, Tamoxifen is found to prevent lung fibrosis and reduce serum TGFÎ²-1 levels. A study&#xD;
      Reported that Tamoxifen have endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibitory effect&#xD;
      better than chloroquine , Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases that play&#xD;
      important roles in protein degradation in various cellular processes including both the&#xD;
      endocytic pathway and autophagy. The role of cathepsins in viral infection was first&#xD;
      identified by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine proteases inhibitor E64d and a&#xD;
      specific cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK are able to block the SARS-CoV infection. A&#xD;
      study demonestrated that Cathepsin D was more sensitive to tamoxifen than to chloroquine.&#xD;
      Tamoxifen exposures decreased the cathepsin D activity at less than 10 pM concentrations. The&#xD;
      effect of chloroquine started at concentration of 15 pM, Finally, the principal investigator&#xD;
      expects strong inhibition of COVID-19 by this combination therapy.&#xD;

      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 ,&#xD;
      AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over&#xD;
      150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues&#xD;
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart,&#xD;
      kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A&#xD;
      study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher&#xD;
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)&#xD;
      or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to&#xD;
      increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available&#xD;
      Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in&#xD;
      cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of&#xD;
      ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being&#xD;
      investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide,&#xD;
      methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of&#xD;
      which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study&#xD;
      demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which&#xD;
      is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be&#xD;
      targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.As&#xD;
      Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2.&#xD;
      and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc&#xD;
      interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in&#xD;
      preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and&#xD;
      SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity&#xD;
      via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)&#xD;
      residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by&#xD;
      approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin&#xD;
      resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP&#xD;
      fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that&#xD;
      MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact&#xD;
      glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated&#xD;
      [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate&#xD;
      residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II&#xD;
      activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage,&#xD;
      which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates&#xD;
      many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular&#xD;
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically&#xD;
      down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the&#xD;
      AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with&#xD;
      receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1&#xD;
      mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition&#xD;
      of AT1,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the&#xD;
      androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to&#xD;
      prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral&#xD;
      receptor, and this is discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical&#xD;
      factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of&#xD;
      its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and&#xD;
      given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is&#xD;
      an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMPRSS2, a key regulator in prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer&#xD;
      shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell lines strongly&#xD;
      upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal&#xD;
      side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue&#xD;
      compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2 gene is a partner in one of&#xD;
      the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG.&#xD;
      This fusion occurs in approximately 50% of primary prostate cancers among men of European&#xD;
      ancestry.While ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the&#xD;
      androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 with the ERG gene. The ERG gene is&#xD;
      consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate&#xD;
      cancers harboring the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2: ERG&#xD;
      fusion is lower in prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the&#xD;
      current COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2: ERG fusion- cancers also have a distinct set of&#xD;
      risk factors related to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically&#xD;
      determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor have a higher risk of TMPRSS2:&#xD;
      ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer but not of fusion-negative prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface&#xD;
      serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is&#xD;
      normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue,&#xD;
      though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs,&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR).&#xD;
      There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor&#xD;
      epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p &lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2&#xD;
      protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose&#xD;
      responsive manner&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women&#xD;
      show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than&#xD;
      men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with&#xD;
      the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the&#xD;
      Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men&#xD;
      are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there&#xD;
      admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the&#xD;
      devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less&#xD;
      than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the&#xD;
      first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health&#xD;
      research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and&#xD;
      just 20 per cent were in women - but the gap has narrowed over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation&#xD;
      between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this&#xD;
      data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey&#xD;
      women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided&#xD;
      infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated&#xD;
      cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell&#xD;
      TMPRSS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in&#xD;
      females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and&#xD;
      women. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males&#xD;
      followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex&#xD;
      steroids in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after&#xD;
      infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen did not&#xD;
      affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were&#xD;
      wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS-CoV&#xD;
      pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or&#xD;
      inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5Î±-Androstan-3Î±,17Î²-Diol) concentration in tissues and blood&#xD;
      because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be&#xD;
      activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be&#xD;
      significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of&#xD;
      flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by&#xD;
      DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT&#xD;
      and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on&#xD;
      expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because&#xD;
      increasing formation of androgenic hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits&#xD;
      Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13- cis -Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the&#xD;
      effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II&#xD;
      transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of&#xD;
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for membrane fusion. In&#xD;
      addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral&#xD;
      infectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the&#xD;
      functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to&#xD;
      lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID-19&#xD;
      reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels&#xD;
      of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels&#xD;
      decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts&#xD;
      to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in&#xD;
      defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator&#xD;
      explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a&#xD;
      well-characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple&#xD;
      enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing&#xD;
      in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is&#xD;
      not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because&#xD;
      this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and&#xD;
      decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over&#xD;
      increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2.&#xD;
      because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and&#xD;
      activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading&#xD;
      to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2.&#xD;
      Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and&#xD;
      functional competence of spermatozoa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamoxifen may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 by inhibition acidification of the endosomes and&#xD;
      lysosomes rather than inhibition of lysosomal enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that tamoxifen causes redistribution of weak base chemotherapeutics from&#xD;
      acidic organelles to the nucleus in drug-resistant cells. Agents that disrupt organelle&#xD;
      acidification (e.g., monensin, bafilomycin A1) cause a similar redistribution. Measurement of&#xD;
      cellular pH in several cell lines reveals that tamoxifen inhibits acidification of endosomes&#xD;
      and lysosomes without affecting cytoplasmic pH. Similar to monensin, tamoxifen decreased the&#xD;
      rate of vesicular transport though the recycling and secretory pathways. Organellar&#xD;
      acidification is required for many cellular functions, and its disruption could account for&#xD;
      many of the side effects of tamoxifen. A sudy demonstrated that the phagocytosis is inhabited&#xD;
      by tamoxifen and chloroquine in retinal epithelial cells A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen&#xD;
      have weak base property and increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics.&#xD;
      Importantly, TAM treatment enhanced survival of mice injected with a lethal dose of STx1 or&#xD;
      STx2,The protective effect was independent of estrogen receptors but dependent on the weak&#xD;
      base property of TAM, which allowed TAM to increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal&#xD;
      dynamics. A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have antimalarial effect via treating mice&#xD;
      infected with P. berghei, which show lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of&#xD;
      cerebral malaria, Tamoxifen is found to prevent lung fibrosis and reduce serum TGFÎ²-1 levels.&#xD;
      Astudy demonstrated that Tamoxifen have endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibitory&#xD;
      effect better than chloroquine , Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases&#xD;
      that play important roles in protein degradation in various cellular processes including both&#xD;
      the endocytic pathway and autophagy. The role of cathepsins in viral infection was first&#xD;
      identified by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine proteases inhibitor E64d and a&#xD;
      specific cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK are able to block the SARS-CoV infection.&#xD;
      Cathepsin D was more sensitive to tamoxifen than to chloroquine. Tamoxifen exposures&#xD;
      decreased the cathepsin D activity at less than 10 pM concentrations. The effect of&#xD;
      chloroquine started at 15 pM&#xD;
