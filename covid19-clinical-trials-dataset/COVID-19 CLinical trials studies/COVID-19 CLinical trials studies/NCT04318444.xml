      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that post-exposure prophylaxis with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine will reduce the symptomatic secondary attack rate among household contacts&#xD;
      of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a massive threat to public health worldwide. Current estimates suggest that the&#xD;
      novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive rate, 2-3)&#xD;
      and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality rate,&#xD;
      0.5-5%). Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related&#xD;
      compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies&#xD;
      conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus&#xD;
      chloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of&#xD;
      developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been&#xD;
      found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously,&#xD;
      hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among&#xD;
      people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a trial of hydroxychloroquine PEP among adult household contacts of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      in New York City (NYC). The trial will be initiated at NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP)/Columbia&#xD;
      University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).&#xD;
