    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought about a requirement of intensive care and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation for a significant portion of patients. Percutaneous tracheostomy is&#xD;
      performed in order to reduce the complications that may develop due to prolonged endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;

      Different methods are needed for situations in which the potential for producing aerosols is&#xD;
      high, such as intubation and tracheostomy. One of these methods is the aerosol box.To share&#xD;
      our experiences of percutaneous tracheostomy performed with aerosol box in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
      Patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy between March 2020 and June 2020 in the&#xD;
      pandemic intensive care unit were evaluated retrospectively.The study is designed as a&#xD;
      clinical trial study. This study was performed in faculty of medicine hospital's intensive&#xD;
      care unit which is located in Canakkale province Turkey.&#xD;
