      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and zinc&#xD;
      gluconate in reducing duration of symptoms in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19). Patients above the age of 18 who present to the Cleveland Clinic outpatient&#xD;
      testing and receive a positive test for COVID-19 will be invited to participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to see whether ascorbic acid and zinc gluconate which has limited side effect profile&#xD;
      and is readily available over the counter can decrease the duration of symptoms seen in&#xD;
      patients with new diagnosis of COVID-2019. A secondary purpose is to see whether Zinc and/or&#xD;
      Ascorbic acid supplementation can prevent progression of the severe manifestations of the&#xD;
      disease including development of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome which may&#xD;
      require hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and or lead to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study which plans to enroll 520 patients&#xD;
      with a principal diagnosis of COVID-2019, managed in an outpatient setting, who presented&#xD;
      after being sent by a healthcare provider to get tested and receive a PCR (Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction) -assay based confirmed diagnosis of the disease. All patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will answer a baseline questionnaire about their symptoms at the&#xD;
      time of inclusion. Patients will then be randomized to one of 4 study arms. Patients in Arm A&#xD;
      (n=130) will receive vitamin C (to be taken divided over 2-3 times a day with meals),&#xD;
      patients in Arm B (n=130) will receive zinc gluconate to be taken at bedtime, patients in Arm&#xD;
      C (n=130) will receive both vitamin C (to be taken divided over 2-3 times a day with meals)&#xD;
      and zinc gluconate (taken at bedtime). Patients in arms A, B and C will take study&#xD;
      supplements daily for 10 days. Patients in Arm D (n=130) will not receive any of the study&#xD;
      medications and continue on standard of care. Patients will then track their symptoms daily&#xD;
      from day 0 to day 28 answering 12 basic questions on illness severity.They will stop filling&#xD;
      out their daily questions once they reach reach the end of the 28 day study period or at time&#xD;
      of hospitalization; whichever comes first . Study team members will call patients at days 7,&#xD;
      14, 21, and 28 of the study period to assess need for hospitalization, ER visit, or&#xD;
      additional medications prescribed by a healthcare provider, and any side effects from the&#xD;
      supplements that the patient could have experienced.&#xD;
