  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot study to assess&#xD;
      the preliminary efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 40 participants are planned for enrollment. Those enrolled into this study will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive either hydroxychloroquine or placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive their study intervention for 5 days, after which they will be&#xD;
      considered off protocol- directed therapy and receive medical management of their disease&#xD;
      according to institutional standards. Participants may be followed for up to 180 days from&#xD;
      initiating protocol therapy for clinical outcome, after which they will discontinue study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

    <description>Hydroxychloroquine is more polar, less lipophilic, and has more difficulty diffusing across cell membranes than the parent compound, chloroquine. These characteristics result in hydroxychloroquine having a longer half-life, comparatively lower toxicity to chloroquine, as well as fewer concerns pertaining to drug-drug interactions</description>

             or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Resting ECG indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as&#xD;
