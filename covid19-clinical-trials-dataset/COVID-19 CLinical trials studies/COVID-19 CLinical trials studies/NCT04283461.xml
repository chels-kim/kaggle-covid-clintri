      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,&#xD;
      starting at 18 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid&#xD;
      nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion&#xD;
      stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at up to 3 domestic&#xD;
      clinical research sites. One hundred and fifty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of&#xD;
      thirteen cohorts (10 micrograms [mcg], 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg, and 250 mcg). Subjects will&#xD;
      receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliters [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29&#xD;
      in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day&#xD;
      394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2, and 4 weeks post each vaccination (Days 8, 15, 29,&#xD;
      36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post second vaccination (Days 119, 209, and&#xD;
      394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose&#xD;
      vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 5 dosages in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be able to understand and agrees to comply with planned study procedures and be&#xD;
             available for all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Agrees to the collection of venous blood per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male or non-pregnant female, &gt;/= to 18 years of age at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.0-35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (&lt; 56 years of age), at screening;&#xD;
             BMI 18.0-30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (&gt;/= 56 years of age), at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing potential* must agree to use or have practiced true abstinence**&#xD;
             or use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception.***, **** Note: These&#xD;
             criteria are applicable to females in a heterosexual relationship and child-bearing&#xD;
             potential (i.e., the criteria do not apply to subjects in a same sex relationship).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Not of childbearing potential - post-menopausal females (defined as having a&#xD;
                  history of amenorrhea for at least one year) or a documented status as being&#xD;
                  surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal&#xD;
                  ligation/salpingectomy, or Essure(R) placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  True abstinence is 100% of time no sexual intercourse (male's penis enters&#xD;
                       the female's vagina). (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception).&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Acceptable forms of primary contraception include monogamous&#xD;
                            relationship with a vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for&#xD;
                            180 days or more prior to the subject's first vaccination, intrauterine&#xD;
                            devices, birth control pills, and injectable/implantable/insertable&#xD;
                            hormonal birth control products.&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Must use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception for&#xD;
                                 at least 30 days prior to the first vaccination and at least one&#xD;
                                 acceptable primary form of contraception for 60 days after the&#xD;
                                 last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 24 hours prior to each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects of childbearing potential*: use of condoms to ensure effective&#xD;
             contraception with a female partner of childbearing potential from first vaccination&#xD;
             until 60 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Biological males who are post-pubertal and considered fertile until permanently&#xD;
             sterile by bilateral orchiectomy or vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects agree to refrain from sperm donation from the time of first vaccination&#xD;
             until 60 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. In good health.*&#xD;
&#xD;
             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or&#xD;
             ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least 90&#xD;
             days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical&#xD;
             diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations,&#xD;
             emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen).&#xD;
             This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a&#xD;
             result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days&#xD;
             before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care&#xD;
             provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same&#xD;
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as&#xD;
             determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to&#xD;
             subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate&#xD;
             a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent&#xD;
             to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not&#xD;
             precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no&#xD;
             anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of&#xD;
             responses to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pulse no greater than 100 beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Systolic blood pressure (BP) is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Clinical screening laboratory evaluations (white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (Hgb),&#xD;
             platelets (PLTs), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine&#xD;
             (Cr), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (T. Bili), Lipase, prothrombin time&#xD;
             (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)) are within acceptable normal reference&#xD;
             ranges at the clinical laboratory being used.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Must agree to have samples stored for secondary research.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Agrees to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Must agree to refrain from donating blood or plasma during the study (outside of this&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Leukapheresis Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for leukapheresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent for leukapheresis is provided.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in&#xD;
        this study:&#xD;

&#xD;
             *Including acute, subacute, intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that&#xD;
