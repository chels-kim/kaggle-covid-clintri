      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that smokers are at a higher risk of having&#xD;
      severe effects or dying from the disease. Smoking causes changes in immune cells. Researchers&#xD;
      think this may be the reason why smokers are more likely to have severe effects from&#xD;
      COVID-19. Researchers want to better understand the interaction between smoking history, the&#xD;
      immune system, and COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand how COVID-19 affects smokers and non-smokers immune systems before and&#xD;
      after being infected with the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 30-55 who are a smokers or non-smokers who may potentially contract&#xD;
      COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened over the phone. They will answer questions about their&#xD;
      demographics, medical history, medications, and smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 6 monthly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, participants will have blood tests. Blood will be drawn through a needle&#xD;
      in an arm vein. They will provide a saliva sample in a container and have a cheek swab. The&#xD;
      participant will also have a nasal swab to see if they currently have COVID-19. Their height&#xD;
      and weight will be taken. They will complete questionnaires about their medical history and&#xD;
      smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then have monthly visits. They will have blood draws to test for COVID-19&#xD;
      antibodies. They will provide a saliva sample in a container and have a cheek swab. The&#xD;
      participant will also have a nasal swab to see if they currently have COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits will occur 4 times or until they have a positive antibody result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a final visit. They will have blood tests. They will provide a saliva&#xD;
      sample in a container and have a cheek swab. The participant will also have a nasal swab to&#xD;
      see if they currently have COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time participants test positive for a COVID-19, they will be rescheduled 14 days or&#xD;
      more after they no longer have symptoms....&#xD;

      Study Description: This study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, single-center,&#xD;
      exploratory study to collect samples and data that will enable explorations of the&#xD;
      interaction between smoking, immune system characteristics and Coronavirus Disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19). This study will collect baseline samples and data prior to COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      required to explore these interactions prospectively. Early evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      suggests that smokers have higher risk for morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. We have identified smoking-associated altered epigenetics, transcription and&#xD;
      changes in immune cell profiles. Smoking exposure drives loss of naive CD8+ T cells and&#xD;
      increases in senescent CD8+ T cells and these effects are signs of immune system dysfunction.&#xD;
      We propose that the immune system senescence associated with prior smoking is a&#xD;
      susceptibility factor in COVID-19 morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To prospectively collect biospecimens and data at baseline and&#xD;
      longitudinally in an identified fashion from eligible participants and retain for future use&#xD;
      to better understand the interaction between smoking history, immune cell profiles and the&#xD;
      natural history of COVID-19 morbidity. We hypothesize that senescent CD8 T cells will be&#xD;
      higher in smokers who develop COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we will establish a bank of cryopreserved peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from before and after COVID-19 exposure from smokers and nonsmokers&#xD;
      and use mass cytometry (CyTOF) to analyze detailed immune profiles, test if the frequency of&#xD;
      senescent CD8 T cells is higher among smokers who develop COVID-19 (antibody positivity)&#xD;
      relative to those who do not develop COVID-19 positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective: To compare potential immunological biomarkers of susceptibility to&#xD;
      viral infection with genetic, epigenetic and other biological characteristics measured in&#xD;
      blood before and at one timepoint after recovery from COVID-19 illness and develop assays&#xD;
      that indicate immune cell dysfunction and COVID-19 susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Levels of senescent CD16+CD8+ T cells before COVID-19 and time to COVID-19&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Smoking exposure biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immune cell profiles identified by CyTOF assays or other single cell assays&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transcriptional profiles from immune cell subtypes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DNA methylation profiles of candidate genes in immune cell subtypes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Male and female participants aged 30 to 55 years old, generally healthy&#xD;
      with a history of smoking (n=60) and nonsmoking (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: All visits will be conducted at the&#xD;
      NIEHS Clinical Research Unit (CRU) in Durham, North Carolina, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Estimated time from enrollment to completion of data analyses is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Estimated average amount of time for a participant to complete all&#xD;
      study visits is 6 months.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and females&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age 30 to 55 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to travel to study visits at the NIEHS CRU for required study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body mass index (BMI) range between 18 and 35 at enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must self-identify as a current smoker (cigarettes and/or use of an e-cigarette/vaping&#xD;
             device), have smoked for 5 years or longer or identify as a non-smoker, having never&#xD;
             used of any other forms of tobacco, nicotine, or smoked marijuana and not currently&#xD;
             residing with a smoker (There may be circumstances where the investigator will still&#xD;
             want to include the par icipant (for example when a participant has smoked a couple&#xD;
             times in the past and the Investigator feels it has been long enough that they can be&#xD;
             included as a nonsmoker or they smoked for over 5 years and quit for a day so they can&#xD;
             still be included as a smoker). However, these are expected to be rare and will need&#xD;
             to be assessed on a case by case basis by the Investigator to maintain scientific&#xD;
             integrity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of confirmed COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current diagnosis of cancer or prior history of cancer, with the exception of&#xD;
             nonmelanoma skin cancer because nonmelanoma skin cancers are not relate to tobacco&#xD;
             smoking and are very common (approximately 20% of US population will develop these).&#xD;
             Treatments are generally topical creams or minor surgery with a very high cure rate.&#xD;
             If these treatments occurred in the past, they are unlikely to impact the outcomes we&#xD;
             are measuring in our pre and post disease study design&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Bleeding disorder or any reason that a blood sample cannot be provided&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current pregnancy or lactation, by participant verbal confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, places the participant at undue&#xD;
             risk for complications associated with required study procedures&#xD;
