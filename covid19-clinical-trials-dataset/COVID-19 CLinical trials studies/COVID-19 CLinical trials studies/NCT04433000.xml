  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound imaging of the lung (LUS) and associated tissues has demonstrated clinical utility&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibilities of a&#xD;
      portable pocket-sized ultrasound scanner in the evaluation of lung involvement in patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 pneumonia, in comparison with a high end ultrasound scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statisical analysis will be performed with Stata for Windows V 16 (Stata corp, Texas College,&#xD;
      TX). Power size estimation using Medcalc 19.3.1, (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostenda, B) showed&#xD;
      that hat 34 patients would be required for the comparison of the two methods using the&#xD;
      Bland-Altman method assuming a mean difference in total score of 1±1, a false positive rate&#xD;
      (α) of 0.05 and a false negative rate of 0.1 (β=0.9).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in December 2019 and quickly spread all&#xD;
      over the globe. The clinical features are fever, dyspnoea, dry cough, fatigue and diarrhoea&#xD;
      (1). Pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and anosmia have also been reported .&#xD;
      Interstitial pneumonia is very common and a high percentage of patients (9-11%) develop&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require intensive care. Current&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy involves agents counteracting viral invasion and replication, and&#xD;
      inhibitors of cytokine-sustained inflammatory reactions. No specific antiviral therapy has&#xD;
      yet been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging of the lung (LUS) and associated tissues has demonstrated clinical utility&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients, due to the typical sonographic characteristics of affected lungs. It&#xD;
      provides indications for clinical decisions and the management of associated respiratory&#xD;
      failure and lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibilities of a portable pocket-sized&#xD;
      ultrasound scanner in the evaluation of lung involvement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform 34 LUS (lung ultrasound scan) evaluations on patients admitted to the COVID&#xD;
      Unit of Siena University Hospital with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, a positive&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 nasal-pharyngeal swab and radiological evidence of interstitial pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided into three severity categories based on respiratory impairment:&#xD;
      Mild PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 300 in room air or oxygen flow; Moderate PaO2/FiO2 between 150 and 300 in&#xD;
      room air or oxygen-therapy, CPAP, NIV or HFNC; Severe PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 150 on oxygen-therapy,&#xD;
      CPAP, NIV, HFNC or mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung ultrasound scans will be performed on the same day with a standard ultrasound&#xD;
      scanner (GE Healthcare, Venue GO) and a pocket-sized ultrasound scanner (Butterfly Network&#xD;
      Inc., Butterfly iQ) for clinical purposes; lung preset will be used with both scanners. Up to&#xD;
      six regions of the chest will be identified: anterosuperior (A); anteroinferior (B);&#xD;
      lateralsuperior (C); lateralinferior (D); posterosuperior (E); posteroinferior (F). One of&#xD;
      four different aeration patterns will be recorded according to a specific scoring system: A =&#xD;
      0 points (normal aeration, presence of lung sliding with A lines or less than two isolated B&#xD;
      lines), B1 = 1 point (moderate loss of lung aeration, multiple well-defined B lines), B2 = 2&#xD;
      points (severe loss of lung aeration, multiple coalescent B lines), C = 3 points (lung&#xD;
      consolidation and tissue-like pattern). Pleural effusion and pneumothorax were also recorded.&#xD;
      A score of 0 was normal and 36 was the worst. Due to clinical conditions, the upper posterior&#xD;
      region (E) could not be explored in some patients, so the mean of the regions explored will&#xD;
      be calculated for the purposes of statistical analysis (total sum (0 to 36) divided by number&#xD;
      of regions explored (5 or 6 on each side).&#xD;
