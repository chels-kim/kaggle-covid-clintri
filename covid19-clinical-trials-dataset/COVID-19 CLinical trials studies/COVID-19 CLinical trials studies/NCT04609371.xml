  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pandemics older adults with chronic physical conditions are a particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      population for unmet mental health needs. This is a consequence of a number of factors which&#xD;
      include decreased access to their doctors because of restrictions in visits in order to&#xD;
      decrease risk of disease transmission and because doctors are seconded to provide medical&#xD;
      services in areas of high priority. Since Public Health authorities worry that pandemics may&#xD;
      be a reality of the future, this study is being operationalized during the present COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in order to see what can be learned about different ways to provide mental health&#xD;
      care under such constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study offers evidence-based approaches to managing feelings of anxiety or depression that&#xD;
      may have existed prior to the onset of a pandemic, or that have arisen during a pandemic. It&#xD;
      uses principles of cognitive behavioural therapy in which participants are offered self-care&#xD;
      tools to help them develop strategies for dealing with their various symptoms. These tools&#xD;
      have already been shown by the team to be effective in other contexts in studies DIRECT-sc&#xD;
      (Effectiveness of a supported self-care intervention for depression compared to an&#xD;
      unsupported intervention in older adults with chronic physical illnesses) and CanDIRECT&#xD;
      (Effectiveness of a telephone-supported depression self-care intervention for cancer&#xD;
      survivors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study, PanDIRECT (Assisting Family Physicians with Gaps in Mental Health Care&#xD;
      Generated by the COVID-19 Pandemic), aims to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can these tools be used in the community care of mental health problems during&#xD;
           pandemics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are they acceptable to patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using a randomized control trial, does lay-coaching of use of these tools improve their&#xD;
           use and patient outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do family practitioners value patient information sent to them at the end of the trial&#xD;

    <description>Arms Assigned Interventions Experimental: self-care tools&#xD;
The tools are adapted from those successfully deployed in the DIRECTsc depression self-care project focusing on patients with depressive symptoms, but abbreviated to meet the needs of the proposed short-term intervention for a broader sample of patients to include those with anxiety symptoms and with minimal symptoms. Tools will include individual chapters of the Antidepressant Skills Workbook; the mood monitoring tool; a workbook on managing worry; relaxation audio files and information on exercise and healthy eating. In view of the short duration of the intervention (8 weeks), a maximum of 2 tools will be sent to each participant.&#xD;
An algorithm will determine which self-care tools, matched to the specific mental health symptoms reported by participants, will be sent to the participants.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the algorithm-determined self-care tools, matched to the specific mental health symptoms reported by participants as in the first arm. They will ALSO be offered up to 3 coach calls. Coaching by a trained lay coach will be structured and guided by a manual. Trained lay coaches will call participants in the week following delivery of the toolkit to guide them through the self-care toolkit over an 8-week period. Coaches will contact participants a maximum of 3 times, with calls expected to average 15-20 minutes. Call content will be guided by a structured coaching manual adapted from those used in the team's previous two RCTs of the self-care materials. The coaches will follow structured agendas, keep records of all contacts.</description>
