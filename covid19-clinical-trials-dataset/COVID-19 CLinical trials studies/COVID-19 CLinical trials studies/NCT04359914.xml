  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium and acute neurocognitive impairment are increasingly observed in adult and pediatric&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19. Prospective clinical studies combining clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      examinations including specific biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury were not performed for&#xD;
      COVID-19. The value of biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury was proven in preliminary studies.&#xD;
      These biomarkers could thus contribute to the systematic detection of neurocognitive&#xD;
      impairment in patients with COVID-19. Due to worldwide increasing numbers of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19, biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury are highly valuable to detect and&#xD;
      monitor cognitive impairment, especially with regard to limited resources available to&#xD;
      perform time-consuming brain imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury are therefore not only of great interest to detect&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment but also to quantify the severity of brain injury in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study evaluating the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      neurocognitive impairment in adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19. All study&#xD;
      participants will be assessed by clinical and neurological examination as well as&#xD;
      comprehensive laboratory tests using biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury at study day 1 (day of&#xD;
      study inclusion), day 3, day 7 and day of hospital discharge. A panel of biomarkers (among&#xD;
      others NSE, S100B and neurofilament proteins) will be measured. Clinical assessment will be&#xD;
      performed using validated delirium tests (among others CAM-ICU, ICDSC) and scales to assess&#xD;
      the neurocognitive performance of study participants before and three months after study&#xD;
      inclusion (among others Short Blessed Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of patients with a comparable severity of disease but without the detection of&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 will serve as control group and will undergo the same clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize, that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop delirium and neurocognitive impairment&#xD;
           than patients without COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with a preexisting neurocognitive deficit are more vulnerable to neurocognitive&#xD;
           impairment in the course of COVID-19 than patients without a preexisting neurocognitive&#xD;
           deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury correlate with the clinical severity of acute&#xD;
           neurocognitive impairment and can predict the 3-month neurocognitive outcome of patients&#xD;
           with COVID-19&#xD;
