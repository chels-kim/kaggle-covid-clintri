    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to remotely monitor individuals who have tested positive for&#xD;
      COVID-19 to learn more about progression and recovery from the disease. Individuals who test&#xD;
      positive for COVID-19 will wear the Current Health wearable device continuously and answer a&#xD;
      brief series of questions on Current Health tablet daily for up to 30 days. The health data&#xD;
      will be used to develop predictive models of hospitalization risk.&#xD;
