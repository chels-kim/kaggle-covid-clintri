  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes have long faced special challenges in implementing effective infection&#xD;
      prevention programs, including limited resources and diagnostic challenges in a frail&#xD;
      functionally disabled long-stay population. Advancing our understanding of the transmission&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 within these facilities for vulnerable populations deserves urgent and further&#xD;
      investigation. Environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 that is reported in limited&#xD;
      studies highlights the potential importance of transmission between patients, their&#xD;
      environment, and healthcare providers via direct and indirect contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV- 2 in the NH patient room&#xD;
      environment over time and the risk of transmission to near and far environments, with the&#xD;
      explicit intent of developing integrated, simple COVID-19 infection prevention strategies&#xD;
      that can be reported to and implemented throughout other nursing homes and long-term care&#xD;
      facilities.&#xD;

      In order to achieve these goals the study is being performed at four different nursing homes&#xD;
      and will include patients with active or with recent COVID-19 infection, as well as nursing&#xD;
      home staff members. The study will test a multimodal aging-friendly intervention including&#xD;
      four components and hypothesizes that the implementation of this organizational, educational,&#xD;
      quality improvement program will be associated with lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to&#xD;
      the environment.&#xD;
