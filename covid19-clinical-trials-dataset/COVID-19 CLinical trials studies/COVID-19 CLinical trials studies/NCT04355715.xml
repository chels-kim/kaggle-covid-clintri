  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to improve the screening for COVID-19 upon admission to the Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital for an act under general anesthesia or at high risk of transmission of&#xD;
      the virus. Indeed, routine nasal swabs present many false negatives (60 to 70%) and many&#xD;
      patients with the coronavirus have little or no symptoms. Performing a chest CT scan can&#xD;
      reveal early signs very suggestive of viral pneumoniae due to the new coronavirus without&#xD;
      additional risk compared to a simple chest X-ray (no injection of contrast medium, low&#xD;
      exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to assess the sensitivity of the diagnosis of COVID-19 by carrying out a&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and a low dose thoracic scanography at the hospital admission of&#xD;
      patients scheduled to a procedure under general anesthesia or at risk of aerosolization&#xD;
      (surgery, endoscopy, procedures involving risk of interventional radiology) in order to limit&#xD;
      the risks of transmission to healthcare professionals or other patients and to rationalize&#xD;
      the use of protective equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational research without modification of care in the setting of COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemia. All clinical and biological data will be issued from routine care and medical&#xD;
      charts. Routine use of CT scan and nasal swabs is an institutional approved strategy.&#xD;
      Serologic tests will be performed as soon as available from serum collection collected after&#xD;
      routine blood analysis. All data will be anonymously recorded after information and&#xD;
      non-opposition of the patient.&#xD;
