  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human immune system is enhanced by exposure to infrared radiation with the wavelength of&#xD;
      5 microns to 20 microns. Humans, at normal body temperature, radiate most strongly in the&#xD;
      infrared at a wavelength of about 10 microns. Infrared energy sustains life and can be used&#xD;
      to treat and prevent diseases, including Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High doses of Vitamin C kills pathogens, viruses and disease-causing microbes. High doses of&#xD;
      Vitamin C increases one's immune system. Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant, produces hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide and removes free radicals from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that infrared radiotherapy by itself or the use of high doses of Vitamin C as&#xD;
      a stand alone dietary supplement or a combination of infrared radiotherapy and Vitamin C can&#xD;
      be used for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infections.&#xD;

      SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION - VIROLOGY &amp; IMMUNOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hirayama E. et al. J. Virology 2004 (Virology)&#xD;
&#xD;
           This paper is the key to how sauna therapy works against RNA viruses, including&#xD;
           Covid-19. Heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) is increased by sauna therapy and inhibits viral&#xD;
           protein export and replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus heat kills Covid-19. Please note that there is no Covid-19 in Desert Areas or&#xD;
           Tropical Countries. Covid-19 is imported from cold climate countries to desert and&#xD;
           tropical countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IMMUNOTHERAPY (High Temperature and Vitamin C Supplement)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is enhanced by infrared energy which increases the body temperature. The&#xD;
      normal body temperature is approximately 36.5 - 37.5 degrees C. Vital energy irradiation&#xD;
      increases the body temperature to the range of 37.5 - 39 degrees C which is equivalent to&#xD;
      fever temperature. The temperature could even be higher than 39 degrees C or high fever&#xD;
      range, depending on the temperature setting of the infrared sauna. The high body temperature&#xD;
      causes an unbearable environment for some pathogens and viruses. White blood cells also&#xD;
      rapidly proliferate due to the suitable environment and can also help fight off the harmful&#xD;
      viruses, pathogens and microbes that have invaded the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body temperature in the fever range has several important functions in the healing&#xD;
      process including, but are not limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. increased mobility of leukocytes ii. enhanced leukocytes phagocytosis iii. endotoxin&#xD;
      effects decreased iv. increased proliferation of T Cells v. enhanced activity of interferon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C&#xD;
&#xD;
      High doses of Vitamin C kills pathogens, viruses and disease-causing microbes. High doses of&#xD;
      Vitamin C increases one's immune system. Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant, produces hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide and removes free radicals from the body. Vitamin C has several other medical&#xD;
      benefits including repairing damaged tissues and organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one does not have an infrared sauna, one can use only high doses of Vitamin C to prevent&#xD;
      and treat Covid-19. The combination treatment, however, achieves faster results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the cold season, one should use high doses of Vitamin C (5 gm to 10 gm, depending on&#xD;
      the body weight, daily) to prevent and treat colds and influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only side effect of high doses of Vitamin C that I am aware of is that it may cause&#xD;
      diarrhea. However, diarrhea is a good way to clean and detoxify the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some experts interpret the prevalence of Covid-19 pandemic worldwide based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Youthful demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Altitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Warmer temperatures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Poorer communities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition (3) above (i.e. Temperature) was dismissed. It is my opinion that warmer&#xD;
      temperatures play critical role in the control, management and treatment of the coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Asia, Europe and North America have pronounced peaks because of cold temperature. A second&#xD;
      wave of the pandemic is hence, expected when winter begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. It is believed that, Latin America and the Caribbean have peaks as a result of poorer&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Middle East and Africa have low cases because of warmer temperatures. This is supported&#xD;
      by the effect on the virus at higher temperatures (Virology) and heightened immune system&#xD;
      when the human body is subject to high temperature (immunotherapy).&#xD;
