      COVID 19 which started from a zoonotic transmission related to crowded markets was confirmed&#xD;
      to have a high potential for transmission to close contacts on 20 January 2020 by the&#xD;
      National Health Commission of China and it was announced as a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no clinically proven specific antiviral agent available for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. Supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy, conservation fluid management, and&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover secondary bacterial infection, remains the most important&#xD;
      management strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the SARS-CoV-2 based&#xD;
      on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronaviruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of of the addition of HCV treatment to&#xD;
      the standard regimen for the treatment of patients who are candidates to receive Hydroxy&#xD;
      Chloroquine according to Egyptian MOHP protocol&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown cause occurred in Wuhan city, the&#xD;
      capital of Hubei province in China. On January 7th, the scientists succeeded to isolate a&#xD;
      novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). WHO&#xD;
      nominated it as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID 19 which started from a zoonotic transmission related to crowded markets was confirmed&#xD;
      to have a high potential for transmission to close contacts on 20 January 2020 by the&#xD;
      National Health Commission of China and it was announced as a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection have a wide clinical spectrum ranging between asymptomatic infection,&#xD;
      mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, and severe viral pneumonia (fever, malaise, dry cough,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, and respiratory distress) that may result in respiratory failure and&#xD;
      finally death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no clinically proven specific antiviral agent available for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. Supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy, conservation fluid management, and&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover secondary bacterial infection, remains the most important&#xD;
      management strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For direct antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the China International Exchange and Promotive&#xD;
      Association for Medical and Health Care (CPAM) recommended usage of lopinavir; ritonavir.&#xD;
      Their recommendation was based on weak evidence from retrospective cohort, historically&#xD;
      controlled studies, case reports, and case series reporting a clinical benefit of lopinavir;&#xD;
      ritonavir in the management of other coronavirus infection [i.e., SARS-CoV 1 and Middle East&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the first randomized clinical trial with lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no benefit&#xD;
      over standard care in 199 hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19. There is no evidence to&#xD;
      support the use of other antiretrovirals, including protease inhibitors; indeed, structural&#xD;
      analysis demonstrates no darunavir binding to COVID-19 protease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of Korean physicians experienced in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients' treatment developed&#xD;
      recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19. According to them, antiviral medications&#xD;
      lopinavir 400 mg; ritonavir 100 mg or chloroquine is considered to be used in older patients&#xD;
      or patients with chronic health conditions and life threatening symptoms. If chloroquine is&#xD;
      unavailable, hydroxychloroquine is recommended. Both of them have reported ability of&#xD;
      inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAM guidelines included them as they were associated with reduced progression of disease and&#xD;
      decreased duration of symptoms. In an open-label study of 36 patients with COVID-19, use of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (200 mg three times per day for 10 days) was associated with a higher rate&#xD;
      of undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal specimens at day 6 compared with no specific&#xD;
      treatment (70 versus 12.5 percent). In this study, the use of azithromycin in combination&#xD;
      with hydroxychloroquine appeared to have additional benefit, but there are methodologic&#xD;
      concerns about the control groups for the study, and the biologic basis for using&#xD;
      azithromycin in this setting is unclear. In the United States, the FDA issued an emergency&#xD;
      use authorization to allow the use of these agents in adolescents or adults hospitalized for&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the studies done on SARS-COV-1 strongly suggested that using ribavirin as therapy&#xD;
      should be reconsidered until further animal studies clarify the effects of ribavirin on&#xD;
      cytokine and chemokine profiles during an infection and until ribavirin can be demonstrated&#xD;
      to have a significant effect on reducing viral replication in vivo. Data from a molecular&#xD;
      docking experiment using the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) model identified&#xD;
      tight binding of sofosbuvir and ribavirin to the coronavirus RdRp, thereby suggesting&#xD;
      possible efficacy of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in treating the COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chen et al. prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like&#xD;
      protease (3CL ) then performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs checking the actions,&#xD;
      targets and side effects of the 16 candidates. Among these, we first noticed velpatasvir and&#xD;
      ledipasvir, which are inhibitors of the NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both are&#xD;
      marketed as approved drugs in combination with sofosbuvir, which is a prodrug nucleotide&#xD;
      analogue inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or NS5B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the SARS-CoV-2 based&#xD;
      on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronaviruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this data the investigators suggest that these dual-component HCV drugs, Epclusa&#xD;
      (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), may be attractive candidates to&#xD;
      repurpose because they may inhibit two coronaviral enzymes. A drug that can target two viral&#xD;
      proteins substantially reduces the ability of the virus to develop resistance. These&#xD;
      direct-acting antiviral drugs are also associated with very minimal side effects and are&#xD;
      conveniently orally administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of HCV treatment to the&#xD;
      standard regimen for the treatment of patients who are candidates to receive Hydroxy&#xD;
      Chloroquine according to MOHP protocol.&#xD;
