      This study examines the efficacy of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) in treating patients with novel&#xD;
      coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, observational cohort study. A total of 50 cases who are&#xD;
      novel coronavirus (COVID-19) positive will be recruited. Presenting to the emergency room of&#xD;
      the study site, these cases will be treated with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) (700 mg every 12&#xD;
      hours) as first-line treatment for 30 days. Standard of care (e.g., Remdesivir approved for&#xD;
      emergency use in severe cases, ventilator for patients with respiratory failure, etc.) will&#xD;
      be provided based on the patient's clinical needs, which will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician. The results of the patient's blood work (e.g. complete blood count,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin [PCT], IL-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR],&#xD;
      etc.), symptom progression, clinical severity, and outcomes will be collected on a daily&#xD;
      basis during hospitalization until. The primary outcomes of interest are rates of intubation,&#xD;
      mortality, and length of stay (LOS) following rapid administration of 700 mg NAG for&#xD;
      COVID-19-related symptoms. Secondary outcomes of interest include: change in COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      severity as assessed by the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement; symptom duration; ICU&#xD;
      admission; supplemental oxygen use and duration; and change in inflammatory biomarker levels&#xD;
      (CRP, PCT, IL-6, ESR). Finally, the safety profile of NAG was evaluated using patient medical&#xD;
      records from Day 1 through discharge.&#xD;
