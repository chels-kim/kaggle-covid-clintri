  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a 6-month 3-arm randomized controlled exercise trial&#xD;
      among older adults to compare the efficacy of yoga with aerobic exercise and&#xD;
      stretching-toning exercises on cognitive function, brain structure and function,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, functional fitness, and inflammatory and molecular markers. Using&#xD;
      a single-blind, three arm randomized control trial, 168 older adults ages 55-79 will be&#xD;
      assigned to either: a Hatha yoga group, an aerobic exercise group or an active stretching and&#xD;
      toning control group. The groups will engage in hour-long group exercise sessions 3x/week. A&#xD;
      comprehensive neurocognitive test battery, brain imaging, cardiovascular fitness test, and a&#xD;
      blood draw will take place at baseline; end of the 6-month intervention, and at 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will examine the relationship between yoga training and improved cognitive&#xD;
      functioning as well as identify neurobiological correlates as potential mechanisms of action&#xD;
      through which yoga training exerts its effect on cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Precautions: Due to COVID-19, all exercise sessions will be conducted live via Zoom&#xD;
      video-conferencing such that 1/3rd of the participants in each group will exercise in person&#xD;
      with the research staff at UIUC campus once a week while the remaining 2/3rd will tune in via&#xD;
      Zoom&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be led through a beginner yoga course taught by a certified yoga instructor. Classes will meet three times a week for 60 minutes over the 6 month study duration. Sessions will focus on yoga postures, breathing, and meditative practices and may utilize mats, blocks, belts, and blankets.</description>

    <description>Trained exercise instructors will lead participants through an aerobic group exercise class. Sessions will begin with a 15-20 minute aerobics class and increase in duration over the 6 months capping off at 40-minutes per session. The prescribed intensity will be 50-60% of the maximum heart rate reserve for weeks one to six and 60-75% for the remainder of the program.</description>
