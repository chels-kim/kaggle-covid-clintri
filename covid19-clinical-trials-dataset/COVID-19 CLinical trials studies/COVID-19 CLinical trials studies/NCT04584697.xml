  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an&#xD;
      expansion cohort phase designed to investigate the safety, PK profile, and efficacy of a&#xD;
      single injection of COVI-AMG in outpatient subjects with COVID-19 but are not likely to&#xD;
      require hospital admission within 24 hours. Subjects will receive one of the following&#xD;
      treatments: 40 mg COVI-AMG, 100 mg COVI-AMG, 200 mg COVI-AMG, or placebo. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 60 days after dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR or an equivalent test, using an appropriate sample&#xD;
             such as nasopharyngeal [NP], nasal, oropharyngeal [OP], or salivary) ≤ 72 hours prior&#xD;
             to randomization. A historical record of positive result from test conducted ≤ 72&#xD;
             hours prior to randomization is acceptable if it can be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be asymptomatic OR have mild symptoms but not requiring imminent (within 24h)&#xD;
             hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing and able to comply with all planned study procedures and be available&#xD;
             for all study visits and follow-up as required by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject or family member/caregiver must have provided written informed consent which&#xD;
             includes signing the institutional review board approved consent form prior to&#xD;
             participating in any study related activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a documented infection other than COVID-19 that requires systemic treatment or in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion could interfere with the participant's safety or interfere&#xD;
             with the assessments if enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely impact&#xD;
             safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be pregnant or lactating and breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has participated, or is participating, in a clinical research study evaluating&#xD;
             COVID-19 convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, or&#xD;
             intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 3 months or less than 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit. Note:&#xD;
             subjects who have been prescribed hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without&#xD;
             azithromycin or other approved products for the off-label treatment of COVID-19 prior&#xD;
             to study enrollment may be included and may continue to receive these agents so long&#xD;
             as the dose remains stable. Additionally, any approved or authorized treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
             remdesivir, dexamethasone or treatments approved under an Emergency Use Authorization)&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
