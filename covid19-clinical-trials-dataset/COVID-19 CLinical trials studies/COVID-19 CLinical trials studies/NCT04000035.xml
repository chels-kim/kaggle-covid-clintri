      HealthAtWork - a measure for increased coping and work participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      -An effect analysis of a health- and work environment intervention at the workplace. Part&#xD;
      1:quantitative data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the workplace intervention&#xD;
      in the new Norwegian national concept HealthAtWork (HelseIArbeid) through a pragmatic&#xD;
      cluster-randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that this interdisciplinary health and welfare intervention at the&#xD;
      workplace reduces sick leave and improves mastering of common health problems more&#xD;
      efficiently than a conventional welfare intervention. More specifically, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the HealthAtWork intervention has a better cost-effectiveness in terms of sick leave,&#xD;
      use of health services and coping with common health problems indicated by an increased&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the workplace intervention&#xD;
      in the new Norwegian national concept HealthAtWork (HelseIArbeid) through a pragmatic&#xD;
      cluster-randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interdisciplinary HealthAtWork intervention consists of three information sessions over&#xD;
      the course of one year, with work place processes in between. In the meetings, structured&#xD;
      health information about musculoskeletal- and mental disorders is given and put in the&#xD;
      context of working and the specific workplace. This includes possibilities to work despite&#xD;
      health impairment, work inclusion measures, and discussion on how these could have an&#xD;
      influence on the individual, group, management and organizational level. The process involves&#xD;
      the workplaces' entire staff (employers and employees). It is an active process and&#xD;
      workplaces are stimulated and expected to continue to work with these topics both between&#xD;
      sessions and after the last meeting. The interdisciplinary intervention is carried out in a&#xD;
      collaboration of qualified personnel from The Norwegian labour and welfare service (NAV) and&#xD;
      qualified health personnel from the hospital department of rehabilitation medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that this interdisciplinary health and welfare intervention at the&#xD;
      workplace reduces sick leave and improves mastering of common health problems more&#xD;
      efficiently than a conventional welfare intervention. Conventional workplace measures are&#xD;
      given by personnel of NAV workplace service without specialist healthcare involvement,&#xD;
      focusing mainly on work inclusion and psychosocial work environment. There are several types&#xD;
      of interventions available and they will be customized to the workplace. This means that the&#xD;
      control intervention is not standardized and will be varying according to the workplaces'&#xD;
      demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating workplaces are recruited through NAV's conventional contact with workplaces&#xD;
      based on an analysis of the workplaces' needs. In the workplaces or workplace units that are&#xD;
      interested in participating in the project, the following will be distributed to all staff-&#xD;
      including leaders- through the employers' email-list: Information about the project, the&#xD;
      informed consent-form and a link to the first electronic questionnaire (Q1). The electronic&#xD;
      questionnaire portal is open to answers for two weeks after the initial email. After this&#xD;
      time period, the workplaces are randomized to either HealthAtWork or control intervention. A&#xD;
      one year intervention period follows as described above. The questionnaire is repeated 12&#xD;
      months (Q2) and 24 months (Q3) after randomization. Q1-3 include the same questions regarding&#xD;
      health complaints, health mastering, health related quality of life, and work environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work participation will be assessed at the unit level by data from the employers' sickness&#xD;
      absence registers that include both self- and physician-certified sickness absence.&#xD;
      Physician-certified sickness absence at the individual level will be gathered from the&#xD;
      National register of sickness absence over a four year period from 2 years before&#xD;
      randomization to 2 years after. Individual sickness absence will also be assessed by&#xD;
      self-report from the questionnaires, considering the last three months prior to the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on healthcare utilization at the individual level will be obtained as self-reported data&#xD;
      from the questionnaires, as well as objective data from the national register of control and&#xD;
      health service refunds (KUHR database) and the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR). These&#xD;
      registers include registrations of visits to general practitioners, emergency clinics,&#xD;
      physiotherapists, radiologic- laboratory- and psychology/psychiatry and other specialised&#xD;
      healthcare services. The study will use the registers' data on number of consultations and&#xD;
      costs related to these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stakeholders involved in the interventions (workplaces/workplace units, specialist&#xD;
      healthcare service and NAV) will keep records of the time used on the interventions&#xD;
      (attendance, preparation, implementation, supplementary work, others). Costs related to the&#xD;
      different interventions will be assessed from these reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measures are based on self-reported questionnaire data including health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, self-rated health, psychosocial work environment, subjective health&#xD;
      complaints, health anxiety, social support and job satisfaction, described in more detail in&#xD;
      the outcome section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-economics analyses will be performed on these data in order to determine the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in terms of sick leave, use of health services and coping with common&#xD;
      health problems indicated by an increased health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has a second part not registered here, gathering qualitative data about the&#xD;
      HealtAtWork intervention. This will investigate how the intervention works, what the&#xD;
      participantsÂ´ impression of the intervention is and how the intervention can best be&#xD;
      implemented, considering its planned future nationwide application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHANGE IN 2020: Due to the global pandemic, the study was completely halted for a period of 6&#xD;
      months from mid-March through September 2020. Activity was slowly regained after that. Due to&#xD;
      this, there were delays in both collection of informed-consent forms and allocation of&#xD;
      workplace units. Consequently, the time-frame for possibility to answer questionnaires was&#xD;
      expanded. For units included before March 12th 2020, questionnaire Q2 and Q3 will be delayed&#xD;
      by 9 months in order to assure that intervention activities could be carried out. We will&#xD;
      take this into consideration in the final statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Difference-in-difference analyses of HRQoL within and between intervention and control groups by use of EQ-5D/EQ-VAS.The EuroQol descriptive system EQ-5D-5L describes health along five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Participants rate each dimension along five severity levels from no problems (1) to extreme problems (5).The resulting combination (5 to the power of 5 = 3,125 possible combinations) is attached a utility value based on a national value set on a scale from 1(best health) to a 0(or even lower) for worst health.A Norwegian value set is currently being developed.The EQ-VAS (EuroQol vertical visual analogue scale;0 as worst,100 as best possible score) is an integral part that has to be included when using the EQ-5D questionnaire.It offers important, complementary information on respondents' valuations of their HRQoL that are not necessarily captured by use of the 5 dimensional descriptive part of this instrument.</description>

    <description>Change in score of the Whitheley index. The Whiteley-7 index (WI-7) includes questions regarding health anxiety covering different dimensions such as self-experienced health concern, frequency and severity of health concerns, influence of media on subjective health concerns and experiencing of health symptoms. Each response is graded on a 1-5 Likert Scale, where &quot;1=not at all&quot; to &quot;5=very much&quot;, enabling to calculate a product score of maximum 35, a higher value indicating higher level of health anxiety. The 7th question in the Norwegian version of WI-7 is not validated for use in a general Norwegian population and is therefore not included in the use of total score sum. It can, however, be used for repeated analyses, both within study time and for comparison with data from the TromsÃ¸ study 7.&#xD;
