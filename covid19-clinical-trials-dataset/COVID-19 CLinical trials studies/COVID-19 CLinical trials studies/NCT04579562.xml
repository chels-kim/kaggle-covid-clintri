  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the unwanted variation in outcomes as evidence by Public&#xD;
      Health England's report on increased mortality in regions of the country. For example, UHDB,&#xD;
      in East Midlands, has reported a high crude mortality as compared to other Trusts in the&#xD;
      region.8 There may also have been variation in the incidence of complications of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      the form of AKI, which may have influenced mortality. Variation in outcomes may be because of&#xD;
      various factors - differing population demographics, underlying health conditions in the&#xD;
      population, deprivation, physician preference and knowledge and ethnic diversity. Unwanted&#xD;
      variation is care that is not consistent with a patient's preference or related to [their]&#xD;
      underlying illness. It is important to understand the reason for unwanted variation in&#xD;
      outcomes associated with COVID-19 to minimise patient harm and reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

        We will use analysis of all admitted patients in the past in England between 1st March 2020&#xD;
        and 30th June 2020 from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), a data warehouse containing&#xD;
        details of all admissions at NHS hospitals in England. This design will help to analyse&#xD;
        large number of AKI patients in short time-span so as to cascade the learning in timely&#xD;
        fashion. HES collects a detailed record for each admitted patient care delivered in&#xD;
        England, either by NHS hospitals. In each patient record, there are specific codes for&#xD;
        additional diagnosis, or operations. We will extract all patients with diagnosis of&#xD;
        COVID-19 by ICD-10 code of U07.1 and AKI as identified by ICD-10 code of N17 in any of the&#xD;
        20 diagnostic codes during the study period.&#xD;
