  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an enhancement of the Fatigue Management Programs for People with MS study&#xD;
      (NCT03550170). The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two interventions delivered remotely to support unpaid caregivers (UC) of people with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS). We hypothesize that a high resource intervention will be&#xD;
      significantly better than a lower resource intervention in terms of the primary outcome (UC&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and stress) and secondary outcome (COVID specific anxiety).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UCs are often caring for persons with chronic disabling conditions, who are at higher risk&#xD;
      for severe COVID-19 illness. This presents incredibly stressful situations for UCs, which can&#xD;
      result in depression, anxiety, and worse health outcomes both for them and their care&#xD;
      recipients. Until a vaccine becomes available, these demands will force UCs to provide more&#xD;
      support, whether in-person or remotely, for persons with MS. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare 2 modes of supporting UCs of people with MS. We will compare the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      high resource highly tailored intervention that includes tele-coaching intervention&#xD;
      (delivered via videoconference or phone) + web site information to a low-resource web-site&#xD;
      only intervention. Our primary outcomes are UC anxiety, depression, and stress (DASS-42&#xD;
      scale) and a secondary outcome is COVID specific anxiety (CAS scale). These 2 interventions&#xD;
      were selected because they will inform administrators and clinicians on whether a&#xD;
      resource-intensive or a low-resource intervention is needed to yield meaningful outcomes. The&#xD;
      comparison will also help UC decide how they should spend their limited time. These&#xD;
      interventions are relevant to UCs of people with MS because of their need for tailored&#xD;
      information provided in flexible ways to promote learning and support.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention arm will receive 4 one-to-one tele-coaching sessions facilitated by an advanced practice social worker. The sessions will take place over a 6-week period and will begin with a needs assessments to allow for tailoring of the intervention sessions. The sessions will include information and support in the areas of: general MS information, strategies for caring for a loved one with MS, MS and Covid (care strategies), caring for yourself, and planning for the future. The intervention will take place using Zoom videoconferencing technology or via telephone- per subject preference. In addition, all subjects will receive access to a study-specific website. The website will have links to publicly available information including general information about MS, online information, self-care, communication, caregiving, COVID-19, future planning.</description>
