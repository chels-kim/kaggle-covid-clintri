  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly throughout the world. A large epidemic would seriously challenge&#xD;
      the available hospital capacity, and this would be augmented by infection of healthcare&#xD;
      workers (HCW). Strategies to prevent infection and disease severity of HCW are, therefore,&#xD;
      desperately needed to safeguard continuous patient care. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a&#xD;
      vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections in in vitro and in vivo studies, and reported morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      reductions as high as 70%. Furthermore, in our preliminary analysis, areas with existing BCG&#xD;
      vaccination programs appear to have lower incidence and mortality from COVID191. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW infection and disease severity&#xD;
      during the epidemic phase of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: A placebo-controlled adaptive multi-center randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: High risk HCW with direct patient contacts, defined as physician&#xD;
      assistants, respiratory therapists, nurses, physicians or other HCWs working at emergency&#xD;
      rooms, ICUs and in locations within hospitals where COVID-infected patients are treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will be randomized between intradermal administration of BCG&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, Randomization, treatment allocation, and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized, IRB approved email will be sent to department chairs describing the study. A&#xD;
      research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an&#xD;
      IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further&#xD;
      instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own&#xD;
      electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to&#xD;
      a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed&#xD;
      recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research&#xD;
      personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the&#xD;
      trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of&#xD;
      baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap,&#xD;
      the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment&#xD;
      assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an&#xD;
      appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant. All eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive intradermal injections of BCG:placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both, participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments during the&#xD;
      study. However, in case of an emergency where it is important to know the treatment received,&#xD;
      the investigator and/or participant can reach out to the unblinded study personnel who will&#xD;
      provide the unblinded data. All participants will receive their treatment allocation at the&#xD;
      end of the study, after the data analysis is finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinded personnel will not be involved in the collection and analysis of study data other&#xD;
      than the baseline eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study is defined as the last patient's last entry in the electronic data&#xD;
      capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent and Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following types of procedures will be conducted as indicated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history will be obtained from patient medical record/clinical chart. Informed Consent&#xD;
      will be obtained to access these records. When information cannot be obtained or is not&#xD;
      available from the patient medical record/clinical chart, it will be obtained via patient&#xD;
      interview. Physical examination will be conducted solely to look for existing BCG vaccination&#xD;
      scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom evaluation will be conducted via an electronic survey administered to participants&#xD;
      every 1-3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV and pregnancy will be collected as self-reported information. If unknown, a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swabs will be collected for rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      infection if a study develops symptoms consistent with Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant does not know their PPD/IGRA status from within the last 24 months (all&#xD;
      health care providers should have this information), an IGRA can be performed to evaluate&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants have the option of donating blood via phlebotomy (for serological test for&#xD;
      Covid-19 disease and PBMCs for immune correlates) or providing a fingerstick and dried blood&#xD;
      spot (for serologic test for Covid-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at four time points/periods: (1) after consent, (2) at baseline, (3)&#xD;
      during follow-up period, and (4) at study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected during screening includes medical history, physical exam results,&#xD;
      results of rt-PCR and serological test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected during baseline enrollment includes eligibility confirmation,&#xD;
      demographic information, risk factors, randomization assignment, confirmation of BCG&#xD;
      vaccination/placebo, any immediate reactions to BCG vaccination/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected during follow-up includes intermittent surveys about the presence of&#xD;
      flu-like symptoms, rt-PCR test results if done, serological test results, if testing positive&#xD;
      for Covid-19 information regarding their disease course, and disease outcome status.&#xD;

      FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed to assess whether they get infected with SARS-CoV2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete intermittent surveys via an electronic system every 1-3 days to&#xD;
      assess the presence of any flu-like symptom, including sore throat, fever, headache, malaise,&#xD;
      and cough. Note that this is part of routine surveillance for Covid-19 in health workers at&#xD;
      the United States site. Consent forms will ask for consent to access this survey information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any positive response on the survey will trigger a nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swab&#xD;
      to be collected to test for Covid-19 via rt-PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants, regardless of survey responses, will have serology for Covid-19 tested at 4&#xD;
      week intervals during the follow-up period (6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant completes the follow-up period and does not test positive for disease, their&#xD;
      study participation is complete&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant does test positive for disease, their disease status will be ascertained for&#xD;
      up to two months or until an outcome is available through one of the following mechanisms:&#xD;
      (1) an electronic survey if they are not admitted to the hospital, including questions about&#xD;
      the number of days they are ill, daily fever, and other symptoms; or (2) (2) if they are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital, ordinal outcomes for disease severity will be extracted from the&#xD;
      hospital¿s electronic medical records system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week of follow-up, all participants will actively be asked about any adverse&#xD;
      events; thereafter, participants will report unsolicited AEs through the electronic survey.&#xD;
      Vaccine related adverse events will be graded using the FDA guidance&#xD;
      (https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download) and noted using WHO-recommended Adverse event&#xD;
      following Immunization forms (AEFI;&#xD;
      https://vaccine-safety-training.org/classification-of-aefis.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma (serology) and PBMCs&#xD;
      for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future analysis based on covid19-specific&#xD;
      IgM and IgG. If they do not donate 12mL of blood, a fingerstick will be required for baseline&#xD;
      COVID19 serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dried Blood Spot (DBS): all participants are HCWs and will self-collect DBS samples at week&#xD;
      4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Envelopes to store the DBS are provided upon enrollment and can be&#xD;
      dropped off at work and picked up by study coordinators to minimize HCW distractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID specific RNA is found in stool for ~21 days when an individual develops infection&#xD;
      (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x). Participants will have the option of collecting&#xD;
      stool swabs monthly if they are asymptomatic or weekly if they develop symptoms. Nucleic acid&#xD;
      testing will be performed in retrospect to support secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop symptoms consistent with COVD19, will be PCR tested for COVID19. They&#xD;
      will be given the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs 2 weeks after&#xD;
      symptoms resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for&#xD;
      plasma and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary&#xD;
      analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 24 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for&#xD;
      plasma and&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on&#xD;
      covid-specific IgM and IgG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for the administration of BCG vaccine or placebo and the above mentioned DBS and&#xD;
      phlebotomy, participants will undergo no invasive procedures for study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data points will be collected during the follow-up period AND AT&#xD;
&#xD;
      END OF STUDY TIMEPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sore throat (collected at multiple time points)&#xD;

      access to this information in Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any&#xD;
      consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent&#xD;
      medical reasons. Participants who received placebo will be unblinded at the end of the study&#xD;
      and pending a recommendation by the DSMB, they will be offered the option of receiving the&#xD;
      BCG intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant will only be replaced in case of withdrawal before the administration of BCG&#xD;
      vaccine/placebo.&#xD;
