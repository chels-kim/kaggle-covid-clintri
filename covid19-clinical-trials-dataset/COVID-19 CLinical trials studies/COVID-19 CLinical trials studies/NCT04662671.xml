  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, ascending dose Phase I/II feasibility study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the RD-X19 device in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with uncomplicated COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham-controlled dose escalation and bioeffect study. The primary goal&#xD;
      of the study is to evaluate the safety of the RD-X19 device in SARS-CoV-2 infected&#xD;
      individuals with outpatient COVID-19 at two dosing schedules, and to assess the reduction of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 viral load in each dose group compared to sham controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety measure is absence of device-related serious adverse events or patterns of&#xD;
      severity ≥2 device-related adverse events. Safety and tolerability (local reactogenicity)&#xD;
      will be assessed actively on each clinic visit by review of potential adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and targeted physical examination, as required. Metabolic, liver, kidney and hematological&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations will be performed at baseline and at Day 8 or early termination (and&#xD;
      potentially during unscheduled) clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methemoglobin assessments will be performed at baseline and Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various efficacy assessments will explore the impact of RD-X19 treatment on the reduction in&#xD;
      log10 SARS-CoV-2 viral load and alleviation of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Both the&#xD;
      magnitude of reduction as a function of dose as well as time to clearance will be assessed.&#xD;
