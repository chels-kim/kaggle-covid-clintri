  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Old age pensions are a common feature of welfare policy worldwide. However, little is known&#xD;
      about the effect of these pensions on the recipients and their families. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will partner with the government of Tamil Nadu, India to study the effects of&#xD;
      old age pensions. Households with a member who is likely to be eligible for the pension but&#xD;
      not currently receiving it will be assigned to either a treatment or control condition. Those&#xD;
      assigned to treatment will receive assistance in applying for the pension. Investigators will&#xD;
      track outcomes of the elderly and their family members for several years following the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the impact of pensions on economic and health outcomes, the study will also&#xD;
      explore how pension receipt affects the elderly's ability to cope with the impact of the&#xD;
      COVID crisis.&#xD;
