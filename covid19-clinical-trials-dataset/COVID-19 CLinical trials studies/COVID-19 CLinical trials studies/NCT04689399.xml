      This project aims to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen test&#xD;
      compared to RT-PCR test performed on samples from the nasopharynx and the oropharynx,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of correct&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 test results of nasopharyngeal swabs examined by rapid antigen test (Standard Q&#xD;
      COVID-19 Ag - test, SD Biosensor INC.) compared with swabs from the oropharynx examined by&#xD;
      RT-PCR test among citizens who have booked an appointment for a COVID-19 test in one of&#xD;
      Testcenter Denmark's test centers in the Capital Region.&#xD;

    <description>We plan to calculate and compare costs of the antigen tests with the RT-PCR tests. Costs are calculated using the ingredients method, in which all components relevant to consider are included in cost estimates. The cost of the tests will include the test kit, instruments needed for testing and salaries of the personnel doing the swaps. Moreover, we will model the opportunity costs of the two alternatives (antigen tests vs. RT-PCR) in terms of their implications for number of sick days, in which patients/test takes cannot resume work. We anticipate that the antigen tests will be less expensive per positive test result and that they will have lower opportunity costs due to immediate test results instead of delayed test results.</description>

    <description>For a sample of the included patients the leftover material from the rapid antigen tests will subsequently be analyzed with the use of PCR to investigate if results diverge based on the anatomic location of the swabbed area. Patients included in the last two days of the study period (30th of December and 31th of December 2020) will be selected to have this additional analysis performed.</description>

    <description>Alle Danish citizens tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2 by swabs in the oropharynx, and subsequently analysis of the specimens by RT-PCR test at Testcenter Danmark's test centers will be included in the study. Participants will, in addition to the oropharyngeal swab they are already schedule for, be examined by a rapid antigen test.</description>
