      Facing the challenge of finding an efficient treatment for COVID-19, the viral pneumonia&#xD;
      caused by the Coronavirus SARS-Cov-2, this study intended to test if Chloroquine or&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine, two drugs with strong in-vitro antiviral role proven by numerous studies&#xD;
      and with a well defined safety profile established, for efficacy in treating COVID-19 and&#xD;
      improving an ordinal primary outcome composed by a 9-levels scale, which was recomended by&#xD;
      the World Health Organization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, Pragmatic, Multicentric Randomized Controled Trial of efficacy to test the&#xD;
      effect of either Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine for 5 days in the recomended dose&#xD;
      standardized by brazilian Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized (1:1) using stratified randomization by hospital and severity at the&#xD;
      moment of randomization (stipulated by use of mechanical ventilation or not) into two arms:&#xD;
      Intervention and Control. Intervention group recieved a loading dose of 900mg of Chloroquine&#xD;
      or 800mg of Hydroxycloroquine in the first day, followed by 450mg of chloroquine of 400mg of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine. Primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated on the 5th, 7th, 10th,&#xD;
      14th, 28th day after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the outcomes presented in the latest version were updated late on&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.org, on October 23, 2020, these outcomes were already present in the trial&#xD;
      protocol approved by the Brazilian National Commission for Ethics in Research on April 8,&#xD;
      2020 (approval number: 3960331) and amending the protocol, approved by the same National&#xD;
      Commission on May 25, 2020 (approval number: 4044848)&#xD;
