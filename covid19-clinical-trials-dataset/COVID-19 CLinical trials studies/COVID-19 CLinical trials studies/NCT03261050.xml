  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people with an eating disorder (ED) do not receive good treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      have developed a new brief group treatment that is supposed to work by reducing how much&#xD;
      women with an ED value the impossible thinness standard promoted by the media and how much&#xD;
      they value/crave binge foods. The investigators want to test whether the treatment actually&#xD;
      changes those two mechanisms using brain scan data, which is more objective than completing&#xD;
      questionnaires and even interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the study (R61), the investigators will compare women in the treatment&#xD;
      versus those on a wait-list. If the investigators can show that the treatment &quot;works&quot; (does&#xD;
      what the investigators think it does) compared to no active treatment (women will be allowed&#xD;
      to seek and receive outside help but investigators will not provide it until after the&#xD;
      wait-list), investigators will conduct the second phase of study (R33),where they will&#xD;
      randomly assign women with an ED to either the new treatment or to a group treatment that&#xD;
      represents what many college mental health clinics provide to their clients with ED.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only 3-20% of individuals with eating disorders (EDs) receive treatment, and those who do&#xD;
      rarely receive evidence-based treatments because they are very intensive and costly, few&#xD;
      clinicians deliver them, and they differ for the various EDs. These factors have hindered&#xD;
      broad implementation of evidence-based treatments, implying that a brief frontline outpatient&#xD;
      treatment for a range of EDs that could be easily, cheaply, and widely implemented would&#xD;
      address a major public health problem. There is also limited experimental evidence regarding&#xD;
      factors that maintain EDs and mechanisms of action for ED treatments. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a project that translates basic persuasion research into clinical&#xD;
      hypotheses and a novel treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that EDs are maintained by (1) excessive valuation of the thin&#xD;
      beauty ideal, which prompts caloric restriction and other unhealthy weight control behaviors&#xD;
      (vomiting, laxative use, excessive exercise) that increase binge eating risk, and (2)&#xD;
      excessive valuation of high-calorie foods, which maintains binge eating. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to evaluate a treatment that addresses these hypothesized maintenance processes. Two&#xD;
      pilot trials evaluated a novel 8-session group dissonance-based treatment (Counter&#xD;
      Attitudinal Therapy; CAT) wherein women with any ED appropriate for outpatient care completed&#xD;
      activities in which they collectively discuss costs of pursuing the thin ideal and the ED&#xD;
      behaviors in which they personally engage (unhealthy weight control behaviors and binge&#xD;
      eating), which putatively creates dissonance about engaging in those particular behaviors&#xD;
      that reduce valuation of the thin ideal and high-calorie binge foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID-19 shelter-at-home orders taking place at both research sites, the&#xD;
      investigators will not measure in-person only outcomes including fMRI, ECG, computerized&#xD;
      implicit associated tests, and height and weight measurements for all participants that have&#xD;
      assessments during this order. The investigators will continue to conduct treatment groups&#xD;
      that will be administered on a virtual platform.&#xD;

    <description>In R61, participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the wait-list condition. Participants assigned to the treatment group receive Counter Attitudinal Therapy (CAT). Participants in the treatment group are compared with participants in the wait-list condition. Participants will complete target and outcome measures at pretest and posttest, plus self-report intervention target and outcome measures at weeks 2, 4, and 6 during treatment for dosage analysis. Additionally, at pre-test and post-test participants will complete two MRI brain scans where they will be exposed to pictures of women and different types of foods. This will assess participants' thin-ideal and binge food valuation. Electrocardiography (ECG) data will be collected at pre and post.</description>

    <description>In R33, participants from wait-list condition are assigned to receive either Counter Attitudinal Therapy or Interpersonal Therapy. Participants will complete target and outcome measures at pretest and posttest, including a 6-month follow-up, plus self-report intervention target and outcome measures at weeks 2, 4, and 6 during treatment for dosage analysis. At pre-test and post-test participants will complete two MRI brain scans where they will be exposed to pictures of women and different types of foods. This will assess participants' thin-ideal and binge food valuation. Additionally, thin-ideal valuation will be accessed outside the scanner at pre, post and follow-up. Similarly, binge food valuation will be accessed outside the scanner at pre, post, and follow-up and weeks 2, 4, and 6 during treatment for dose-response analysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) data will be collected at pre and post.</description>
