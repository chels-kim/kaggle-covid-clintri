  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational COVID-19 study that uses wearable health monitoring technology to&#xD;
      follow COVID-19 positive individuals to monitor persistent symptoms and any potential&#xD;
      long-term complications or cardiovascular and behavioral impacts from the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will wear a Biostrap wristband device that captures high-fidelity, raw&#xD;
      photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms and collects important indicators of heart and mental&#xD;
      health, including heart rate, heart rate variability, pulse points, oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      sleep patterns. Biometric data will be collected and participants will be alerted if any&#xD;
      measurements are outside their normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are recruiting 100 participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;

    <measure>Mental health effect of COVID-19 measured by incidence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) using Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) Scale includes 7 questions to be answered by the patient, each answer is scored from 0 to 3, and the scale range is from 0 to 21, with a higher number representing more severe GAD level</description>

    <measure>Mental health effect of COVID-19 measured by incidence of depression using Beck Depression Fast Screen Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Fast Screen Scale includes 21 questions to be answered by the patient scored from 0 to 3, and the scale range is from 0 to above 40, with a higher number representing more severe depression level</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental health effect of COVID-19 measured by incidence of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) using the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist- Standard Form (PCL-S) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist- Standard Form (PCL-S) Scale includes 20 questions to be answered by the patient scored from 1 to 5. Total symptom severity score (ranging 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items. Higher number represents more likely that the patient has PTSD.</description>
