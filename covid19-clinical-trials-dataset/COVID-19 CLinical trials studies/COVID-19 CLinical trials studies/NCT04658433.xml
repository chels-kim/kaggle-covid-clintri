  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) is involved in blood pressure regulation and&#xD;
      electrolyte balance. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a critical regulator of RAAS by&#xD;
      cleaving angiotensin (Ang1) to Angiotensin2 (Ang2), which is the most powerful biologically&#xD;
      active product of RAAS [1]. In the same context, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&#xD;
      converts Ang2 to Ang (1-7), which is a vasodilator, antithrombotic, and antihypertrophic&#xD;
      peptide [2]. ACE2 which is found in many tissues [3] has opposite effects to ACE on the&#xD;
      heart, kidneys, and lungs [4]. Many pathological conditions, in particular cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), have shown a link between a disturbance in ACE/ACE2 ratio and the&#xD;
      downregulation of ACE2 levels [5]. Also, ACE/ACE2 has been reported to be higher in moderate&#xD;
      to severe chronic heart failure [6] as well as systolic blood pressure [7]. Recently, an&#xD;
      elevated ACE/ACE2 ratio is linked to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-COV2 enters&#xD;
      target cells by binding of the spike protein to ACE2 and a specific transmembrane serine&#xD;
      protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the spike (S) protein priming, which also leads to downregulation of&#xD;
      ACE2 [8]. Down-regulation of ACE2 caused by Coronavirus may have a potential role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, people with a higher ACE/ACE2 ratio may be&#xD;
      more at increased risk of worse Covid-19 consequences [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, omega-3 fatty acids could decrease CVD risk by their anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      anti-thrombotic function [10]. A meta-analysis comprising 15,806 patients, showed that&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids associated with a 30% reduction in fatal myocardial infarction and sudden&#xD;
      death, in addition to a 20% reduction in overall mortality [11]. To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, no clinical trials have evaluated the effect of omega-3 supplementation on serum&#xD;
      ACE/ACE2 ratio which is recently ascribed as a potential key in 2019 Covid-19 as well as CVD&#xD;
      [5,9].&#xD;
