  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory phase II&#xD;
      study enrolling 60 patients. We propose the administration of a blinded dose of an&#xD;
      investigational product (IP) (clazakizumab or placebo[0.9% saline]) in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      disease and signs of pulmonary involvement who have not yet required mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and/or ECMO. If a patient progresses to mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO or develops&#xD;
      clinical signs of deteriorating COVID-19 disease, and there are no treatment related serious&#xD;
      adverse events(SAEs), within the initial 14 day period after the first dose of the IP, at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator or treating physician, open-label clazakizumab 25mg IV X 1&#xD;
      dose may be administered. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP&#xD;
      and this dose of open-label clazakizumab. The patient will remain blinded as to the identity&#xD;
      of the IP administered in the first dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease with signs of pulmonary involvement will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive the anti- IL-6 drug clazakizumab 25mg IV or placebo. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for improvements in clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters which are part of&#xD;
      our COVID-19 lab panel described below. Patients will receive SOC supportive treatment and&#xD;
      will be followed for 14 days. If a patient from either group progresses to the need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO, or develops clinical signs of deteriorating COVID-19&#xD;
      disease, and there are no serious treatment related SAEs, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator or treating physician, the patient may receive a single dose of open-label&#xD;
      clazakizumab 25mg IV. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP and&#xD;
      this dose of open-label clazakizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will receive clazakizumab 25 mg or placebo (0.9% saline) given by IV&#xD;
      infusion over 30 minutes. Clazakizumab will be administered in 50 mL of 0.9% saline on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 lab panel and clinical parameters will be monitored to determine if patients are&#xD;
      progressing towards need for ventilation and/or ECMO. The parameters below will be monitored&#xD;
      and patient status will be assessed by the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients do develop these criteria, open-label clazakizumab 25 mg IV may be administered&#xD;
      as discussed above. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP and this&#xD;
      dose of open-label clazakizumab. Patients ventilated with or without ECMO will continue to be&#xD;
      monitored post-treatment for signs of improvement, (i.e., decreasing FiO2 requirements, CXR&#xD;
      improvements, CRP reductions, extubation and discharge home) or death.&#xD;
