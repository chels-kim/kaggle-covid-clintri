  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening programs have been associated with a substantial reduction in colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) mortality through endoscopic resection of preneoplastic lesions and detection of&#xD;
      early-stage invasive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared as a pandemic the outbreak of&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 have&#xD;
      never stopped spreading, causing an unprecedented situation with highly restrictive&#xD;
      considerations to be adopted by the majority of countries worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-care facilities have been making an enormous effort to assist patients affected by&#xD;
      COVID-19, while adopting measures to maintain a safe environment for patients and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. As a result, the usual workflow in endoscopy departments changed dramatically,&#xD;
      leading to an increase in cancelled procedures, probably increasing the future burden of&#xD;
      Colorectal Cancer due to delays in diagnosis.&#xD;
