  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the peripheral muscle function, sleep disorders and&#xD;
      physical activity level in children with cystic fibrosis who are physically inactive at home&#xD;
      due to social isolation and to examine the effect of the 6-week online exercise protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic global information, some patient&#xD;
      populations have been identified at higher risk of this pandemic like older age,&#xD;
      hypertension, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Self- isolation is recommended for&#xD;
      preventive strategy in cystic fibrosis patients. Long-term social isolation and school&#xD;
      closure can have negative effects on childrens' physical and mental health. Due to social&#xD;
      isolation childrens are less physical active, have longer screen exposure and irregular sleep&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study to evaluate the the peripheral muscle function, sleep disorders and&#xD;
      physical activity level and examine the effects of exercise training in children with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis in social isolation due the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be included children with cystic fibrosis who had stabile conditions&#xD;
      Patients' peripheral muscle function, sleep quality and physical activity level will be&#xD;
      assess and record at beginning, after the twelve and eighteen session.&#xD;

    <description>Sleep quality will be evaluated by Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ). Epworth Sleepiness Scale evaluates persons' daytime sleepiness and scores ranged from 0-24. Higher scores indicate higher daytime sleepiness. PSQ consist of 22 items that evaluate the frequency and severity of snoring during sleep, apnea at night during sleep hyperactivity and other pediatric obstructive sleep apnea symptoms. Responses to the items are as &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and &quot;I don't know&quot; which are scored as 1, 0 and missing respectively. Total score of PSQ is the mean of the scores of all items excluding the missing items.</description>
