      This study is a 2-arm, parallel design, single-blind randomized controlled pilot study&#xD;
      designed to compare the effects of a tailored multi-level physical activity intervention&#xD;
      (PAI) vs healthy living intervention (HLI) on exercise capacity, cardiovascular and cognitive&#xD;
      function, health-related quality of life (QOL), strength and fatigue among lymphoma and&#xD;
      breast cancer patients undergoing active treatment with anthracycline based chemotherapy&#xD;
      (anthra-bC).&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) questionnaire to assess disease-specific health related quality of life (HRQoL). The FACT-Lym scale measures HRQoL using a forty-two question assessment that measures physical well-being, social well-being, and emotional well-being. Each item on the FACT-Lym scale is scored from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (very much). All items are summed to create a total score (range 0-108) and sub-scales may be scored separately for questions related to physical well-being (range 0-28), social well-being (range 0-28), emotional well-being (range 0-24), functional well-being (range 0-28), and for lymphoma specific additional concerns (range 0-60). Negatively worded items are reverse scored prior to summing so that higher sub-scale and total scores indicate better QoL.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed by utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue scale (FACT-fatigue) assess fatigue. The FACT-fatigue scale assesses cancer related fatigue using a thirteen question scale. Each item on the FACT-Fatigue scale is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). All items on the scale are summed to provide a total score for fatigue (range 0-52)</description>

    <measure>Assessment of General Health</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) will also be used to to measure subject's general health. All items on the SF-36 are scored from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Scores are calculated for eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions.&#xD;
All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <description>Those who opt-in to attend in-person study visits and to undergo COVID testing will also complete an MRI exam and CPET testing. Participants unwilling to have COVID testing done will only complete an MRI exam and home-based testing. All testing will take place either within 6 weeks of initiating systemic treatments or within 8 weeks of completing radiation then at 3 &amp; 6 months. Patients may participate in 1-2 training sessions per week offered under the direct supervision of a master's level clinical exercise physiologist, as well as 1-2 sessions at home. PAI sessions consist of slow aerobic warm-up, followed by 20 minutes of strength training,15 minutes of progressive intensity aerobic exercise (AE), and then 10 minutes of stretching for cool-down. Participants will have the ability to participate in training sessions facilitated via online channels at home.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control arm will either attend online sessions via secure video conferencing (e.g. Zoom) or telephone or to come to a centralized meeting location (if safety allows) to participate in organized health workshops. Session attendance will be required 2 times/month (over the 6 months). Make up sessions will be offered for those participants who have to miss a group session. Each session lasts 60 minutes and matches the number of visits made by the PAI group as much as possible.</description>
