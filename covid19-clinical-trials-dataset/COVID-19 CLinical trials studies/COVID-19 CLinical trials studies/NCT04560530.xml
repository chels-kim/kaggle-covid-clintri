    <textblock>
      The role of CT scan of the chest in Pre-anesthetic assessment of the severity of COVID-19 and&#xD;
      the correlations between CT measurements of the aortic and pulmonary arteries diameters and&#xD;
      severity of pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were scheduled for emergency surgery during COVID-19 pandemic should have be&#xD;
      screened for COVID pre-operatively given the prevalence f asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic&#xD;
      cases that could be carriers to infection and possibly cause cross infection to the operating&#xD;
      room staff especially the anesthetists who deal with the upper airway during intubation with&#xD;
      high possibility of getting infected with SARS-COV 2 virus. Waiting respiratory tract PCR&#xD;
      (RT-PCR) test for COVID can delay the surgery which may increase patients morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. RT-PCR test has limited sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19 infection (have positive RT-PCR) or patients who&#xD;
      have possible COVID-19 infection (have symptoms but were not tested with RT-PCR) will undergo&#xD;
      non-enhanced CT scanning of the chest (without giving IV contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest CT scan will be interpreted by 2 Consultants radiologists with an experience of at&#xD;
      least 10 years in their field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologists are going to be requested to comment on the lung parenchyma, describing the&#xD;
      findings , assess the pulmonary artery, aorta diameters and the aorta:pulmonary diameters&#xD;
      ratio will be then calculated. The degree of pneumonia severity index will then be described&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologists will be blinded to the aim of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected and then correlation between the data sets will be statistically&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
