  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarilumab is an anti-interleukin-6 human monoclonal antibody, such as tocilizumab, which is&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously every two weeks for the treatment of moderate to severe active&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients. Despite the effectiveness reported for tocilizumab in&#xD;
      the recently published experiences, the need to rapidly find alternative therapies to manage&#xD;
      the complications of Covid-19 infection remains extremely high. The lack of clinical&#xD;
      experience on the usage of sarilumab in such patients prevents the possibility of adopting&#xD;
      early access programs for using commercially available sarilumab (prefilled syringe) packs in&#xD;
      patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia. The present study is aimed to generate a rapid,&#xD;
      still robustly documented, evidence on the potential clinical efficacy and tolerability of a&#xD;
      further IL-6R antagonist in Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In February 2020, the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and, especially, in&#xD;
      Lombardy, with a potential fatal outcome in a significant proportion of cases, determined the&#xD;
      need for adopting new therapeutic approached based on the few data available in literature.&#xD;
      Although there are no clinical data available in COVID-19 patients concomitantly treated with&#xD;
      Sarilumab subcutaneously (SC) nor intravenously (IV), there is scientific rationale that&#xD;
      supports the exploration of sarilumab to treat pulmonary complications related to&#xD;
      Covid-195-6. By inhibiting interleukin-6 (IL-6)signaling, sarilumab may potentially interrupt&#xD;
      cytokine-mediated pulmonary injury precipitated by infection with SARS-CoV-2 and thereby&#xD;
      ameliorate severity and/or reduce mortality among patients presenting with Covid-19 pneumonia&#xD;
      when administered in conjunction with antiviral therapy. given the apparent dose/dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) equivalence of 400 mg of tocilizumab to 400 mg of&#xD;
      sarilumab, we propose a dose escalation protocol by which the first 5 included patients will&#xD;
      be treated with a dosage of 200 mg of sarilumab IV as 1st dose, followed by clinical&#xD;
      reassessment after 12 hours and in case of no major adverse events and lack of improvement in&#xD;
      respiratory function and / or persistence of fever and persistently high inflammatory markers&#xD;
      re-administration of 200 mg intravenous (IV) of sarilumab. If no patients showed unfavorable&#xD;
      safety signals, and no clear improvement is detected in &gt;50% of the initially treated five&#xD;
      patients after 96 hours since last administration, the dosage will be increase to sarilumab&#xD;
      400 mg IV as first and second dose in the remaining patients.&#xD;
