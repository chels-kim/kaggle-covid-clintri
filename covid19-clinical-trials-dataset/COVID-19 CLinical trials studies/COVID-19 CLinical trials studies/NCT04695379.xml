  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a&#xD;
      &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot; (January 31, 2020), has posed a&#xD;
      significant threat to global health. This infectious disease, caused by the 'severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2'(SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in China at the end of&#xD;
      2019. As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the human respiratory system. The&#xD;
      most common symptoms are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. During the second week of the&#xD;
      disease, part of patients may progress to shortness of breath, then hypoxemia and severe&#xD;
      pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), linked to some risk factors such as&#xD;
      advanced age and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular disease), may be fatal and needs early supportive therapy and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with COVID-19 experienced neurological complications including headache,&#xD;
      dizziness, hypogeusia and/or anosmia, altered level of consciousness, strokes, seizures, and&#xD;
      ataxia, less frequently neuromuscular disorders (NMD) such as acute inflammatory&#xD;
      polyradiculoneuropathy. Among NMD, myasthenia gravis (MG) patients, particularly susceptible&#xD;
      to infections causing crises, could be of special risk of COVID-19 ARDS. Some general&#xD;
      recommendations were established for the management of NMD during the COVID-19 pandemic,with&#xD;
      also specific recommendations for MG. However, only data on a small number of patients who&#xD;
      were managed in hospital are currently available;in addition, only two cases of myasthenic&#xD;
      crisis following COVID-19 were reported. For this reason, the French neuromuscular rare&#xD;
      disease network (FILNEMUS: 'FILière NEuroMUSculaire') has created the 'CO-MY-COVID register'&#xD;
      to describe the clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing&#xD;
      myasthenic syndrome.&#xD;

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a&#xD;
      &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot; (January 31, 2020), has posed a&#xD;
      significant threat to global health. This infectious disease, caused by the 'severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2'(SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in China at the end of&#xD;
      2019. Nowadays, with the exception of Antarctica, COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic that&#xD;
      continues to spread around the world (8,065,966 known cases and 437,604 deaths in June 16,&#xD;
      2020; https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/). As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 primarily&#xD;
      targets the human respiratory system. Its most convincing mode of transmission is inhalation&#xD;
      of infectious aerosols or direct contact of infected people's droplets. The most common&#xD;
      symptoms are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. During the second week of the disease, part of&#xD;
      patients may progress to shortness of breath, then hypoxemia and severe pneumonia. Acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), linked to some risk factors such as advanced age and&#xD;

    <time_frame>at inclusion (at the time of the COVID-19 diagnosis)</time_frame>
    <description>The Myasthenia Gravis-specific Activities of Daily Living scale consists of the assessment of 8 parameters: speaking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, self-care activities (brushing the teeth or combing the hair), simple physical activities (getting up from a chair), double vision and eye lid dropping. Each parameter is subjected to assessment depending on the degree of symptoms intensification, awarding points from 0 to 3 points. The maximum number a patient may receive is 24 points. The higher the score of points, the bigger limitations of the patient in everyday life activities caused by intensification of myasthenia gravis (Wolfe GI, Herbelin L, Nations SP, Foster B, Bryan WW, Barohn RJ.
