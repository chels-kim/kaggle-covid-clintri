  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite their established benefits as public measures, vaccines continue to be treated with&#xD;
      suspicion by many people, in the US and other parts of the world (Larson et al. 2014; Olive&#xD;
      et al. 2018; Lazarus et al. 2020). Since the success of vaccines depends on their high uptake&#xD;
      level (Anderson and May, 1985; Fine et al. 2011; Fontanet and Cauchemez, 2020), identifying&#xD;
      factors that influence low trust and decision-making in relation to vaccines is essential in&#xD;
      order to combat diseases such as the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study factors that could potentially influence public's trust in COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines through a large-scale online field experiment. The investigators conduct an online&#xD;
      survey of 32,400 subjects in nine countries (USA, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, Indonesia,&#xD;
      Russia, Germany, and UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study how willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is affected by (1)&#xD;
      the &quot;novelty&quot; of the vaccine technology (conventional vs. RNA vaccines), and (2) the adoption&#xD;
      rate of the new vaccine in the country. That is - the impact of controversial science and the&#xD;
      force of conformity on the rates of adoption. The latter will also allow us to calculate the&#xD;
      &quot;tipping point&quot; adoption rate for each country that will allow the country to achieve herd&#xD;
      immunity from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have four hypotheses, below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1 (Conformity): People are more willing to receive a vaccine as the cumulative adoption rate&#xD;
      in their community increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2 (Novelty): People are less willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine that uses the new RNA&#xD;
      technology, compared to a conventional vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3 (Interaction between H1 and H2): As the cumulative adoption rate in a community increases,&#xD;
      the difference between people's willingness to adopt conventional rather than RNA vaccines&#xD;
      decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4 (Tipping Point): Each country will have a different &quot;tipping point&quot;. This is the&#xD;
      cumulative adoption rate after which unvaccinated people are significantly more willing to&#xD;
      get the vaccine. Countries that have a higher &quot;honesty index&quot; will have the tipping point&#xD;
      appear at a lower cumulative adoption rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study the role of trust in COVID-19 vaccine through a global survey.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators vary (1) the degree of vaccine innovation and (2) the&#xD;
      adoption rate of the vaccine to test if these factors influence the individuals' willingness&#xD;
      to receive the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An online survey is conducted across 9 countries with 3,600 subjects per country. About 15&#xD;
      questions will be asked for each subject and the survey is expected to take about 10-15&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 9 countries are USA, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Germany and the UK.&#xD;
      The three most populous countries from three major continents (Americas, Asia and Europe) are&#xD;
      chosen. The target subjects are healthy adults over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey instrument will consist of two parts. In the first part, the survey will ask 10&#xD;
      questions regarding their demographics and the general perception on the safety,&#xD;
      effectiveness, and importance of vaccines. This part of the survey allows us to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between the individual factors (such as age, gender or income status) and trust&#xD;
      in COVID-19 vaccine, as well as to normalize the attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines over the&#xD;
      overall vaccine-related confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 key questions of interest are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Suppose that a conventional vaccine for COVID-19 receives approval for human use and is&#xD;
      available for the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A3. How much do you think the government should subsidize the conventional COVID-19 vaccine?&#xD;
      [10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%]&#xD;
&#xD;
      A4. If the conventional COVID-19 vaccine were provided to you for free, how likely are you to&#xD;
      accept the vaccination? [Very likely, somewhat likely, neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat&#xD;
      unlikely, very unlikely]&#xD;
&#xD;
      A5. Suppose the conventional COVID-19 vaccine is endorsed by your Government, free, but no&#xD;
      one in your country has received the vaccine. How likely would you be willing to be&#xD;
      vaccinated with this new vaccine? [Very likely, somewhat likely, neither likely nor unlikely,&#xD;
      somewhat unlikely, very unlikely]&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators manipulate two dimensions of information between the subjects. The two&#xD;
      dimensions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 vaccine types: 50% of subjects will be asked for &quot;conventional vaccine&quot;; 50% of&#xD;
           subjects will be asked for &quot;RNA vaccine&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 different levels of adoption rate in the country: 0% (i.e., no one in your country has&#xD;
           received the vaccine), 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each country, there will be 2 (vaccine type) x 5 (different adoption rates) = 10&#xD;
      between-subject treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the survey, the investigators ask participants to complete a simple&#xD;
      economic dice-rolling task, and predict outcomes of the same task in their own country. The&#xD;
      investigators will study how individual performance in these tasks correlate with their trust&#xD;
      in COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
