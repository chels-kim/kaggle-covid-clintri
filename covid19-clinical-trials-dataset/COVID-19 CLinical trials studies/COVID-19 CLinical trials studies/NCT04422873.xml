      To understand the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the wellbeing, quality of life and&#xD;
      physical activity of people with end-stage renal disease, currently dialysing in-centre&#xD;
      versus at home in the UK and their experience of telemedicine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered&#xD;
      coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      respiratory illness, however, some older people and those with underlying medical problems&#xD;
      are more likely to develop serious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group who are particularly vulnerable at this time is people with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD). Of this group, particularly at risk are those at the more severe end of the disease&#xD;
      spectrum [end stage renal disease (ESRD], who rely on renal replacement therapy (RRT), in the&#xD;
      form of dialysis, to do the job of the kidneys. The investigators currently have a programme&#xD;
      of clinical research investigating the impact of home versus in-hospital RRT, using both&#xD;
      qualitative (IRAS: 264200) and quantitative approaches (IRAS: 254251). A key focus of this&#xD;
      work is to explore determinants of wellbeing, function and overall quality of life that are&#xD;
      linked to dialysis modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Monday 23rd March, the UK Government imposed significant restrictions with regards to&#xD;
      human movement, for at least three weeks (recently extended to at least 6 weeks) to try and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of the COVID-19 disease spreading within the UK. These included: only&#xD;
      shopping for basic necessities; one form of exercise a day, such as a walk, run or cycle;&#xD;
      travel for specific medical needs; those travelling to and from work, where this is&#xD;
      absolutely necessary and it cannot be done from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interesting time, since it is usually observed that people who dialysis at home&#xD;
      (i.e. home haemodialysis) typically have more freedom to go out, as they do not have the&#xD;
      thrice weekly commute to a renal clinic, which is a burden itself, to then undergo ~4 hours&#xD;
      of dialysis at the unit. People who dialyse at home are now isolating entirely and in charge&#xD;
      of their own treatment, resulting in very little contact with others. The Wessex Kidney&#xD;
      Centre has, however, implemented remote clinics and has been trialling an application to&#xD;
      assess patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as part of its ongoing programme of&#xD;
      research. Those dialysing in-centre however, continue to have contact with medical staff in&#xD;
      person thrice weekly and are forced to break isolation and go into a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the proposed study, the research team will capture patients' experience during this&#xD;
      unique and unprecedented time, in order to guide practice moving forwards and identify&#xD;
      potential areas for intervention. More specifically, the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      understand the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the wellbeing, quality of life and physical&#xD;
      activity of people with end-stage renal disease, currently dialysing in-centre versus at home&#xD;
      in the UK and their experience of telemedicine. This information may be used to help us&#xD;
      better support individuals in the future and investigate the feasibility of telemedicine in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice.&#xD;
