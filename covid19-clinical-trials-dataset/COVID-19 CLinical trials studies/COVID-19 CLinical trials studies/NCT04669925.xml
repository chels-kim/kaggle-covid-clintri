      This study has 3 main goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to quantitavely describe the Covid-19 impact on the organization and functioning of the&#xD;
           Lombardy's emergency system;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to create statistical model able to predict the flow of patients to the emergency room&#xD;
           during the epidemic period and their destination (ex: discharge, hospitalization,&#xD;
           death);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to value the impact on the non Covid-19 patients, both for their possibility to receive&#xD;
           medical treatment and as an outcome on their health&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact that Covid-19 had on the Emergency System of&#xD;
      Lombardy. For instance, it affected the job organization and the possibility of responding to&#xD;
      general health needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, the study will consider the calls to the Emergency Medical Service, the number&#xD;
      of accesses to the Emergency Department, the waiting time before hospitalization, the ED&#xD;
      output home (discharge, hospitalization, death, self-discharge before the end of the visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, a statistical model will be implemented, in order to predict the number of patients&#xD;
      in need of hospitalization for each day during the pandemic period. This model could help the&#xD;
      re-organization of the hospital itself in case of a new Covid-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it will evaluate the impact on non-Covid patients, to see the difference in the&#xD;
      mortality trends and their possiblity to be cured in a proper way.&#xD;
