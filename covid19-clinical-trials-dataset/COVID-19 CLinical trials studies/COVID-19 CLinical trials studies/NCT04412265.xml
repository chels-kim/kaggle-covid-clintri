    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric retro-prospective observational study that wants to evaluate the&#xD;
      relation between frailty and clinical outcomes in elderly patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of frailty is today the best way to evaluate the biological age of the elderly&#xD;
      person. Fragility can be defined as a syndrome selected by the reduction of organized&#xD;
      reserves and by the decreased resistance to &quot;stressors&quot;, resulting from the cumulative&#xD;
      decline of multiple physiological systems that cause vulnerabilities and adverse&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of fragility on clinical outcomes has been investigated in numerous studies&#xD;
      conducted on elderly patients in various care setting, proving in all of them a significant&#xD;
      and more reliable predictor of variables such as age, comorbidity and individual pathologies,&#xD;
      short and long-term mortality, length of stay and the onset of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have already shown that frail older adults have a greater susceptibility to&#xD;
      viral infections (including non-COVID-19 coronavirus) due to a malfunction of their immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of fragility could therefore be particularly useful for identifying&#xD;
      subjects at risk of negative outcomes (worsening of respiratory parameters, need for&#xD;
      intubation, mortality) even in a ward with COVID + patients. In other words, the&#xD;
      imperceptible clinical heterogeneity behind the age parameter could be better represented by&#xD;
      a multidimensional parameter capable of measuring the accumulation of age-related deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE (n. patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to recruit 30 subjects per week on average; for an expected total of about&#xD;
      300 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be enrolled in the study when obtaining consent. In this phase the following&#xD;
      data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brescia_COVID respiratory scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modified Early Warning Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  delirium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data relating to functional autonomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood chemistry data at the entrance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the variables that are part of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, it will be&#xD;
      possible to calculate the Frailty Index (FI), according to the Rockwood deficit accumulation&#xD;
      model. A series of variables will then be collected relating to treatment procedures,&#xD;
      therapies, the team's choice to maximize the care ceiling for the individual patient and the&#xD;
      patient's clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated as per Normal Clinical Practice; no blood chemistry tests will be&#xD;
      required in addition to the panel of tests provided by the hospital's health management for&#xD;
      all patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the difficulty in systematically obtaining written informed consent and given the great&#xD;
      public interest of the project, the research will be conducted in the context of the&#xD;
      authorizations guaranteed by Article 89 of the GDPR EU Regulation 2016/679, which guarantees&#xD;
      the treatment for purposes of public interest, scientific or historical research or&#xD;
      statistical purposes of health data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FI will be built according to the Rockwood deficit accumulation model, taking into&#xD;
      account a minimum number of variables that are part of the Comprehensive Geriatric&#xD;
      Assessment. The FI will be obtained from the ratio between the number of pathological&#xD;
      conditions present and the total number of indicators evaluated. Data from patients older&#xD;
      than 60 years of age will be compared.&#xD;
