      PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) is a prospective cohort study of pregnant&#xD;
      and recently pregnant women who are: either patients under investigation for COVID-19 or a&#xD;
      confirmed case of COVID-19. Data from PRIORITY will be used to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      COVID-19 on the clinical course and pregnancy outcomes of pregnant women and women within 6&#xD;
      weeks of pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit women age 13 or older under investigation for COVID-19 or with&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19 at any clinical state across the United States. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be identified through voluntary physician referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an eligible patient is referred to the PRIORITY Coordinating Center at UCSF, a UCSF&#xD;
      study coordinator will follow-up by phone with the patient and consent verbally. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete an approval to release medical information. The&#xD;
      investigators will use patient questionnaires to assess symptoms, maternal clinical course,&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes from initial investigation of COVID-19 to 12&#xD;
      months. The investigators will also obtain all medical records for the participant to data&#xD;
      abstract key clinical and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
