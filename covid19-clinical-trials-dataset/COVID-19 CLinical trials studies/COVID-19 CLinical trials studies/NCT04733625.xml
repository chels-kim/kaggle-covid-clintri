  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing pandemic of SARS CoV-2 virus is calling for effective preventive and theraputic&#xD;
      interventions. Vitamin D has been shown to play immunemodulatory functions in human. Low&#xD;
      vitamin D levels have been linked to increased susciptability to infections especially the&#xD;
      acute respiratory infections. This randomised controlled study aims to explore the effect of&#xD;
      vitamin D administration on the outcome of SARS- CoV2 virus&#xD;

      Background: Coronavirus disease COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic and is causing avoidable&#xD;
      fatalities worldwide. Vitamin D plays an essential role in the immune system. Vitamin D&#xD;
      interferes with the majority of the immune systems cells such as macrophages, B and T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. We aim to find whether supplementation of&#xD;
      vitamin D deficient diabetes with a single intramuscular cholecalciferol injection could&#xD;
      improve the prognosis of those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: This was a placebo controlled randomized prospective study, included&#xD;
      cohorts of 40 diabetes elderly patients who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with 16&#xD;
      elderly diabetes patients matched of the same age group who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 but&#xD;
      given a placebo instead intramuscularly were used as a control. Clinical, laboratory,&#xD;
      treatment, and outcome data were recorded after six weeks of follow up especially ICU&#xD;
      admissions and fate of COVID-19 disease.Vitamin D was given as a single intramuscular&#xD;
      injection during period of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Elderly type II diabetes adult with age more than 60 years males and females having&#xD;
        deficient serum vitamin D levels (less than 25 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diabetes patients recruited to the control group were only included in the study if not&#xD;
        known to have cholecalciferol supplementation within last 6 weeks. All elderly vitamin D&#xD;
        deficient diabetes patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 when throat-swab specimens for&#xD;
        SARS-CoV-2 PCR were positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with known history of renal stones, diagnosis of hypercalcemia with the past&#xD;
             year, baseline serum total calcium more than 10mg/dl, established diagnosis associated&#xD;
             with increase the risk of hypercalcemia (e.g. metastatic cancer, sarcoidosis, multiple&#xD;
             myeloma, primary hyperparathyroidism), and current vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Moreover, other exclusion criteria included those with known malignancy, with organ&#xD;
        transplant, and those with known chronic autoimmune diseases and lastly those on systemic&#xD;
        steroid for any cause&#xD;
