    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence, characteristics,&#xD;
      management and outcome of patients admitted to U.S. hospitals with non-COVID-19 related&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most common cause of death and the most expensive condition among hospitalized&#xD;
      patients in the U.S. The delivery of high-quality care for sepsis necessitates optimal&#xD;
      institutional functionality and availability of adequate healthcare personnel and resources.&#xD;
      However, since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit the U.S., fear of&#xD;
      acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in&#xD;
      fewer patients with acute conditions seeking hospitalization. Furthermore, the rapid&#xD;
      onslaught of COVID-19 admissions has profoundly strained hospital supplies, personnel and&#xD;
      care processes and left little time to re-calibrate the management of other acute conditions&#xD;
      that share these resources. As such, the impact on the detection, triage, monitoring,&#xD;
      resuscitation, and outcome of patients with sepsis is currently unknown. Large administrative&#xD;
      and clinical data repositories of inpatient discharges that are populated in near-real time&#xD;
      may enable study of contemporaneous inpatients with COVID-19 and sepsis (without COVID-19)&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of hospital admission&#xD;
      for non-COVID-19-related sepsis and septic shock and the proportion of these patients that&#xD;
      receive Intensive Care Unit-level care. This analysis will assess for dynamic changes in the&#xD;
      number of patients developing and/or seeking hospital care for sepsis and septic shock during&#xD;
      the pandemic and whether the burden of critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 may have impacted the threshold for providing ICU-level care to patients with&#xD;
      sepsis and septic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the trend in risk-adjusted mortality among patients admitted with&#xD;
      non-COVID-19-related sepsis and septic shock during the pandemic. This analysis will indicate&#xD;
      whether being hospitalized for sepsis/septic shock during vs. prior to the pandemic was&#xD;
      associated with any change survival. An analysis will be performed to identify prognostic&#xD;
      factors associated with non-COVID-19-related sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the impact of COVID-19-specific center-level characteristics (e.g. case&#xD;
      volume, multi-ICU status, intubation threshold) on risk-adjusted mortality of&#xD;
      non-COVID-19-related sepsis and septic shock during the pandemic period. Identification and&#xD;
      modification of pandemic-related triage and processes that impact survival in sepsis may help&#xD;
      preserve quality of care when health systems are strained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Determine the impact of COVID-19 on processes of care in the management of sepsis:&#xD;
      This aim will investigate whether COVID-19 has impacted key quality processes in the&#xD;
      management of patients with sepsis present on admission (POA).&#xD;

    <description>Non-COVID-19 sepsis patients will be identified with sepsis or septic shock without a COVID-19 diagnosis code or a positive COVID-19 laboratory test.&#xD;
Sepsis patients will be defined as patients with concurrent infection and organ dysfunction. Presumed concurrent infection will be defined as a blood culture order and â‰¥ 3 days of antibiotics administration, including at least 24h of intravenous antibiotics, or death while on antibiotics within 3 days of admission. Organ dysfunction will be defined by ICD-10-modified acute organ failure score. Sensitivity analyses will use ICD-10 explicit sepsis codes to define non-COVID-19 sepsis instead.&#xD;
COVID-19 will be identified based on receiving a diagnosis code for COVID-19 (U07.1) or legacy coding (prior to the implementation of a specific COVID-19 code) present-on-admission and/or a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on admission</description>
