      Because of its strong spread, variability, survivability, and invisibility, the number of&#xD;
      infected people rise rapidly. On March 11, 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a&#xD;
      pandemic disease. As of October 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has exceeded 34&#xD;
      million, and the cumulative deaths have exceeded 1 million. There are still no drugs to&#xD;
      treatment the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the mutation of virus rapidly,&#xD;
      vaccine development cannot be completed in a short period of time. At the beginning of the&#xD;
      infection outbreak, the governments of China and South Korea, adopted a cooperative of&#xD;
      Chinese and Western medicine to treatment the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In&#xD;
      addition to the reported good clinical effects, Chinese medicine prescriptions have included&#xD;
      in diagnosis and treatment guideline of these two countries.&#xD;
