  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the world was shaken awake by a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). In most nations drastic isolation measures&#xD;
      were taken to minimize the further spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Being&#xD;
      the first pandemic sparked by a Coronavirus, little was known on COVID-19 and its&#xD;
      implications on general health. Our understanding on the virus and its potential effects on&#xD;
      health is growing. In Belgium, the situation is stabilizing, and doctors and healthcare&#xD;
      workers are slowly recommencing routine work and consultations. As also fertility treatments&#xD;
      were abruptly interrupted, many patients are in need to resume their treatment. The limited&#xD;
      evidence of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy seems to be rather satisfying1, but practically nothing&#xD;
      is known about the possible impact of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection on female gametes. Viral&#xD;
      transmission occurs predominantly through respiratory droplets, but transmission to gametes&#xD;
      cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the onset of the pandemic, knowledge about the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection rapidly grew. Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses. For a virus to deliver their&#xD;
      genome into the host cell, attachment and entrance into that cell is a crucial step. The&#xD;
      coronavirus surface protein spike (S) mediates entry into target cells by binding to a&#xD;
      cellular receptor and subsequent fusing of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. The&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-S protein (SARS-S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor&#xD;
      for host cell entry. Host proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are&#xD;
      then needed to cleave the viral S protein, allow-ing permanent fusion of the viral and host&#xD;
      cell membranes2. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been shown in testicular, uterine and&#xD;
      placental cells. Based on available transcriptomic data, co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is&#xD;
      also seen on oocyte level, but the possible impact on reproduction is unknown. The BSG&#xD;
      (basigin or CD147), a receptor on host cells, was also identified as a possible route for&#xD;
      viral invasion.&#xD;
