    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety profile of CORVax +/- pIL-12,&#xD;
      (electroporated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plasmid DNA vaccine with or without the&#xD;
      combination of electroporated IL-12p70 plasmid), given as prime &amp; boost doses, four weeks&#xD;
      apart, in healthy volunteers, divided into age groups of 18-50 versus &gt; 50 years old.&#xD;
      IL-12p70 plasmid DNA electroporation (tavokinogene telseplasmid) has been extensively studied&#xD;
      in over 209 subjects across 11 trials including later stage human cancer trials with more&#xD;
      than 1000 administrations. The IGEA CLINIPORATORÂ® system is approved for clinical use in&#xD;
      Europe, but remains investigational in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One participant will initially be enrolled to each of four cohorts and monitored over a 7-day&#xD;
      DLT window:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1A. Age 18-50; CORVax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. B. Age 18-50; CORVax + pIL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A. Age &gt; 50; CORVax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2B. Age &gt; 50; CORVax + pIL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after 7 days, no DLT are observed, the cohort may proceed to enroll a second participant.&#xD;
      If after monitoring the second participant for 7 days, no DLT are observed, the cohort may&#xD;
      proceed to enroll a third participant. If after monitoring the third participant for 7 days,&#xD;
      no DLT are observed, the cohort may proceed to enroll six additional participants, for a&#xD;
      total of nine participants per cohort using a (1+1+1, +6) design.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Comorbidities, controlled or otherwise, associated with higher risk for severe&#xD;
             COVID-19 illness - because our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;

             of screening regarding risk factors for severe disease, using resources such as those&#xD;
             described on the Centers for Disease Control website:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders including but not limited to&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease), diverticulitis (with&#xD;

             or Wegener syndrome (granulomatosis with polyangiitis), Graves' disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, (see Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug(s) or compounds of similar biologic&#xD;
             composition to the study drug(s), or any of the study drug excipients.&#xD;
