  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mental health of the French population in response to covid-19 pandemic is of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health professionals are prone to more mental disorders due to their direct exposure to the&#xD;
      pandemic consequences. Indeed, compared to general population, health care workers face&#xD;
      enormous in the current health situation, especially those who may be in contact with&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed cases (risk of infection, inadequate protection, loss of control, lack&#xD;
      of experience in managing the diseases, overwork, stigma, lack of support). Thus, it seems&#xD;
      interesting to describe the psychological state of hospital interns during this pandemic.&#xD;
