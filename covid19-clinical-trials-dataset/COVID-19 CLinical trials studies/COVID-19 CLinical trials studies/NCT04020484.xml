  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a debilitating condition characterized by spontaneous, unprovoked seizures. Up to&#xD;
      80% of children with epilepsy (CWE) may face cognitive, psychiatric, and/or behavioral&#xD;
      comorbidities with significant unmet mental health needs. Mindfulness-based interventions may&#xD;
      provide an ideal vector to target unmet mental healthcare needs in patients with epilepsy and&#xD;
      their families. The investigators propose the Making Mindfulness Matter© (M3) program as an&#xD;
      intervention to improve health related quality of life and mental-health for CWE and their&#xD;
      parents. M3 is live-online parent and child program that incorporates mindful awareness,&#xD;
      social-emotional learning skills, neuroscience, and positive psychology. This pilot RCT is&#xD;
      needed to refine the implementation of the intervention to families with a child with&#xD;
      epilepsy, and collect information pertaining to the feasibility and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention in preparation for a subsequent multi-centred trial across Canada. Note: Due to&#xD;
      COVID-19, the format has been modified for online delivery (from community-based) and the&#xD;
      intervention has been restarted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recognizing that medical management for chronic illness such as epilepsy does not address the&#xD;
      stress and co-occurring psychological issues experienced by many patients, mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions have been increasingly utilized. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective,&#xD;
      well-validated interventions for several adult outcomes including physical and mental health,&#xD;
      social and emotional well-being, and cognition. Meta-analyses report overall medium effect&#xD;
      sizes of 0.50 to 0.59 across these outcomes. In a recent Cochrane review of psychological&#xD;
      interventions for people with epilepsy, three studies specifically examined mindfulness-based&#xD;
      techniques for adults with epilepsy and determined positive outcomes on mental health, HRQOL&#xD;
      and seizure outcomes. There has been far less research on mindfulness with children and youth&#xD;
      than in adults; studies that have been done have been plagued with methodological limitations&#xD;
      including small numbers, lack of randomization or control groups. However, evidence to-date&#xD;
      indicates that mindfulness interventions for children and youth are feasible, accepted and&#xD;
      enjoyed by participants. The few well conducted studies on mindfulness interventions in&#xD;
      children without physical health issues have reported reduced symptoms of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and stress, reduced maladaptive coping and rumination, and improved behavioural&#xD;
      and emotional self-regulation and focus. Furthermore, a recent systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis found that mindfulness interventions were three times more effective in&#xD;
      alleviating psychological symptoms among children with clinically diagnosed psychological&#xD;
      disorders (such as anxiety, learning disability and externalizing disorders), compared with&#xD;
      healthy controls. This suggests that mindfulness interventions may be particularly relevant&#xD;
      for those with clinical levels of psychological disorders, a particularly relevant finding&#xD;
      for our study given that children with epilepsy experience greater levels of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, learning disability and behavioural comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the benefits of programs that deliver mindfulness interventions directly to&#xD;
      children, programs that target parents and parents appear to be effective in improving&#xD;
      parental functioning and in turn, promote child outcomes. Furthermore, studies are indicating&#xD;
      that mindfulness-based interventions for parents of children with chronic issues (attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental delays, autism) are effective for lessening&#xD;
      parental stress and mental health problems. Improvements in parent-child relationship and&#xD;
      improved youth behaviour management have also been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the Cochrane review on the impact of psychological treatments for people with&#xD;
      epilepsy, nor a recent systematic review on mindfulness interventions in youth found studies&#xD;
      investigating mindfulness management techniques for CWE. Despite the paucity of studies of&#xD;
      mindfulness interventions in childhood epilepsy, there is converging evidence to suggest&#xD;
      studying a mindfulness-based intervention in children and families with epilepsy is&#xD;
      warranted. There is research pointing to the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions&#xD;
      on psychological symptoms in adults and children, especially in those with relevant clinical&#xD;
      issues similar to CWE. The investigators believe the M3 program is ideally suited for use&#xD;
      with CWE and their parents for a number of reasons. The program was developed from the&#xD;
      validated, widely used, and successful Mind UP program for use in the community and augmented&#xD;
      to integrate a parent component, and has been shown to be successful in our cohort of young&#xD;
      children and their parents facing adversity. Importantly, M3 is suitable for children as&#xD;
      young as 4 years of age, which is particularly important as evidence to date suggests that&#xD;
      early identification and treatment of epilepsy comorbidities is essential as there may be a&#xD;
      window of opportunity for early intervention in some children. Interventions must be&#xD;
      implemented early before problems become entrenched and interfere with the development of&#xD;
      basic cognitive, behavioral, and social skills crucial for long-term educational, vocational,&#xD;
      and interpersonal adaptation. The low-cost, interactive online group delivery and&#xD;
      facilitation by non-clinician staff also allows the program to be scalable to communities&#xD;
      across Canada and increases its likely sustainability.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a parallel, partially nested randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two arms: intervention (M3) and treatment-as-usual (i.e. wait-list control). Participants will be randomized 1:1 into the intervention or control arm. This study will not interfere with patients' clinical care. The intervention will be delivered online to groups of 4-8 on a rolling basis to minimize wait-times and allow for timely access to the intervention for the waitlist controls. We believe this strategy is very important to increase the odds that families will decide to participate in the study. Sample size calculations showed that 76 child-parent dyads will be required (38 intervention, 38 control), and to account for a liberal 24% attrition rate, 100 child-parent dyads will be recruited.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Blinding of participants and program facilitators (i.e. the staff delivering the M3 program) will be difficult to completely achieve given the nature of the intervention. The investigators will attempt to ameliorate bias by explaining to participants and program facilitators that the study is interested in evaluating the intervention to be given to all participants, however, in planning the logistics of the intervention, some participants will receive the intervention in the very near future, whereas others will receive the intervention in approximately 12 weeks. In so doing, the investigators hope to eliminate any biases associated with the participants' and program facilitators' perception or biases of being assigned to the treatment or control group.</masking_description>

    <description>The investigators will track the number of patients contacted, response rate, attrition and reasons for non-participation and attrition. At the start of each session, parents will complete a one-page (12-item) semi-structured questionnaire evaluating treatment fidelity, at home utilization of M3 skills. At the end of each session, parents will complete an overall feedback form on the intervention. Facilitators will complete a two-page questionnaire providing feedback on the session. At the start and end of the M3 program, children will be asked to complete a feeling face questionnaire rated on a 3-point scale about topics discussed in the group such as how our brain works when upset and what is mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Effect of M3 on Health Related Quality of Life of children with epilepsy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE-55) is a 55-item measure that emphasizes a functional approach to quality of life. QOLCE-55 generates an overall quality of life score, and four subscale scores: cognitive, emotional, social and physical functioning. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better quality of life.&#xD;
Although the QOLCE is a widely used HRQOL scale, no study has calculated the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). To calculate the MCID for the QOLCE, the Patient Centred Global Ratings of Change will be used, a 5-item scale where respondents indicate the amount of change relative to baseline. Rating from -7 (much worse) through 0 (no change) to +7 (much better). This information will allow us to calculate the MCID for the QOLCE-55, and thereby identify the proportion of patients who experience a clinically meaningful change following intervention.</description>

    <description>Child-parent dyads will undergo a standardized 8-week course of Making Mindfulness Matter© (M3). The program will be delivered online using live, interactive sessions to groups of 4 to 8, for 1.5 hours each week for the parent group and 1 hour each week for the child group. Children and parents will attend separate on-line sessions and at the end of each child session, the parent will be asked to join their child on-line for a shared mindful exercise. Once 4 to 8 dyads are assigned to the intervention group, participants will be given the baseline questionnaires and start the intervention in the following week.</description>

    <description>Child-parent dyads randomized to the control arm will continue treatment as usual. Once 4 to 8 dyads are assigned to the control group, participants will be given the baseline questionnaires, They will complete the Baseline and Immediate Follow-up questionnaire at comparable times to families in the intervention arm; they will not complete the Extended Follow-up questionnaire. These dyads will be provided with the intervention at the next scheduled session; the goal is to provide the intervention to controls as soon as possible to avoid differential attrition between the intervention and control arm. During the intervention sessions, they will complete all feasibility surveys pertaining to the intervention and their satisfaction with each intervention session.</description>

    <description>Making Mindfulness Matter© (M3) is an interactive online parent and child program that incorporates mindful awareness, social-emotional learning skills, neuroscience, and positive psychology. This program was modelled after the school-based MindUP™ program for use in the community and augmented to integrate a parent component. M3E is a facilitator-led program that integrates attitudes, skills, and behaviours related to mindfulness and social-emotional learning (SEL). During the 8-week concurrent parent and child manualized program, parents learn the same core principles as children: how our brains work, stress and the brain, mindful breathing, mindful sensing, mindful movement, perspective taking, optimism, and gratitude/acts of kindness.</description>
