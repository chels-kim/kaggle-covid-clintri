      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a home-based exercise training during social&#xD;
      isolation due to covid-19 pandemic in patients who undertook bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study by phone call. The research&#xD;
      team will visit the included patients. All patients giving the written consent will perform&#xD;
      the following tests before being randomly allocated into exercise training or control: 1)&#xD;
      blood pressure; 2) anthropometric measures; 3) blood sampling; 4) handgrip test; 5) sit and&#xD;
      stand test; 6) exercise capacity; 7) nutritional recalls and 8) health-related&#xD;
      questionnaires. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to control group (will receive&#xD;
      information to keep active and eating healthy) or exercise training group (will receive a&#xD;
      telemonitored exercise program through video conference, three times a week, during 3&#xD;
      months). Following 3 months of intervention, the outocomes will be re-assessed.&#xD;
