      Recruitment SSubjects hospitalised or attended the hospital ED with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, will be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will have the opportunity to ask any questions to the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will provide a copy of the information sheet to the subject,&#xD;
      who will have the opportunity to ask any questions to the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects expressing an interest in participating will be interviewed to explain the study in&#xD;
      detail, and discuss the risks, benefits, goals and limitations of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures. Potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent prior to&#xD;
      any study specific procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the provision of informed consent, the subject's demographics and medical history&#xD;
      especially that relating to SARS-CoV-2 will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature, respiration) will&#xD;
      be conducted. Female subjects of child-bearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
      A blood sample will be drawn for routine haematology and biochemistry. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      tests for oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to provide details of any concomitant medications. Subjects with&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      providing informed consent will be registered on the e-CRF to obtain a randomisation number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline/Randomisation A physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse,&#xD;
      temperature, respiration) will be conducted. Subjects will undergo tests for oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, PaO2/FiO2 and interleukin-6. Haematology and biochemistry test (from screening)&#xD;
      results will be confirmed as being acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study centre will dispense the IMP under blinded conditions according to a permuted block&#xD;
      randomisation sequence (1:1 ratio for the two subject groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be trained on the dosing and asked to administer two capsules twice daily&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. Subjects will then be provided with IMP on a daily basis by a suitably qualified&#xD;
      and delegated member of the Investigator's team, for the duration of the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase (Week 1-3) All subjects will receive standard of care treatment throughout&#xD;
      the treatment phase on a day to day basis. This will include assessment of additional or&#xD;
      alternative medication required for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, requirement for intubation&#xD;
      and invasive ventilation, requirement to transfer to intensive care unit or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a weekly basis, a physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature,&#xD;
      respiration) will be conducted. Subjects will undergo tests for oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      and IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to provide details of any concomitant medications and changes in&#xD;
      condition via adverse event (AE) query.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 A physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature, respiration)&#xD;
      will be conducted. Subjects will undergo tests for oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 and IL-6.&#xD;
      Female subjects of child-bearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test. A blood&#xD;
      sample will be drawn for routine haematology and biochemistry. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      provide details of any concomitant medications and changes in condition via AE query.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6 (Follow -up) 6 weeks after randomisation (or two weeks after early withdrawal), the&#xD;
      subject will be contacted to check the occurrence of any other adverse events and review of&#xD;
      medications. Haematology and biochemistry test (from week 4) results will be confirmed as&#xD;
      being acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be assessed by spontaneous reports by subjects.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject must satisfy the following criteria for entry into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, aged 18 years and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Provide informed consent prior to any study specific procedure being conducted; for&#xD;
             older patients who lack mental or physical capacity, next of kin or legal guardians&#xD;
             will be allowed to provide consent on their behalf. This consent can be obtained&#xD;
             remotely by telephone to the next of kin, or by a doctor with relevant experience in&#xD;
             COVID-19 disease not directly involved in the study acting as the patient's advocate&#xD;
             and then subsequently informing the next of kin (eg by a telephone call also offering&#xD;
             them an opportunity to review and agree the ICF with them; the patient may then&#xD;
             continue in the study or withdraw at a later date if the next of kin subsequently&#xD;
             decides to withdraw consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive local approved test to confirm diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Classified as moderate or severe based on the modified WHO/NIH baseline severity&#xD;
             criteria. Moderate: evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment (e.g.&#xD;
             signs or symptoms of lung infection) or by chest X-ray/CT/ultrasound imaging (e.g.&#xD;
             viral pneumonia, lung infiltrates) and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) ≥ 94% on room air&#xD;
             at sea level. Severe: respiratory frequency &gt;30 bpm, SaO2 &lt; 94% on room air at sea&#xD;
             level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
             (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 300 mmHg, or lung infiltrates &gt;50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Hospitalised or attended the hospital ED due to clinical and/or virological diagnosis&#xD;
             of SARS-CoV-2; subsequent follow up after screening may be carried out in hospital&#xD;
             (hospitalised) or at a COVID-19 hospital OP clinic as clinically indicated at the&#xD;
             investigator's discretion. Where it is not possible for the subject to attend a&#xD;
             hospital OP clinic, then providing a suitably trained healthcare professional (eg part&#xD;
             of the clinical research team) as directed by the investigator, is available to visit&#xD;
             the subject at home to conduct the necessary clinical and SaO2 assessments and blood&#xD;
             tests, subsequent assessments post-hospitalisation or ED visit may be conducted at the&#xD;
             subject's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject will be excluded from the study if any of the following applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. No symptoms or signs or lung imaging abnormalities of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. On or clinically diagnosed as requiring intubation at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. On or clinically diagnosed as requiring mechanical ventilation at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (heated, humidified, oxygen delivered via reinforced nasal cannula at flow rates &gt; 20&#xD;
             L/min with fraction of delivered oxygen ≥ 0.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. On or clinically diagnosed as requiring noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. On or clinically diagnosed as requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unable to swallow study capsules easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known allergic reaction or intolerant to fish or fish oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known allergic reaction to excipients of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant or breast-feeding at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Taking other fish-oil supplements (e.g. cod liver oil) who are unwilling to stop them&#xD;
             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Taking immunomodulators/immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids on entry into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Evidence of multi-organ failure, SOFA score &gt; 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Deemed, by the investigator, unlikely to be able to comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Deemed, by the investigator, likely to require transfer to the intensive care unit&#xD;
             (ICU) or unlikely to survive for at least 48 hours.&#xD;
