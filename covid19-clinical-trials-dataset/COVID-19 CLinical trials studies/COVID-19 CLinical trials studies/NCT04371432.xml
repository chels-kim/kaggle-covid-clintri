      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health problem, and genetics&#xD;
      may play a role in how serious the illness becomes in certain people. Genes are the&#xD;
      instructions that our body uses to grow and develop. Variations in our genes can cause&#xD;
      medical conditions and may be the reason why some people get sicker than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to learn more about the genetic contributions to the severity of COVID-19. We&#xD;
      hope to use this information to develop therapies that reduce the severity of COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms in some people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone located in the United States who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be&#xD;
      eligible to join (including NIH staff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire about their health history and COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood or saliva sample. It will be about 2 tablespoons of blood, or&#xD;
      we will send a saliva collection kit. Researchers will use this blood or saliva sample to&#xD;
      study the participant s DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about participants genes will be stored in a large database. The database will be&#xD;
      shared with other qualified researchers who are trying to learn about COVID-19. Participants&#xD;
      names and other personal details will not be shared. Instead, the data will be labeled with a&#xD;
      code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted by study team members for up to a year after they join the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a serious challenge to public health. Individuals&#xD;
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience extremes in symptomatology ranging from a complete lack&#xD;
      of symptoms to rapidly worsening end-stage pulmonary disease. The explanatory mechanism&#xD;
      underlying susceptibility to severe disease remains unknown. We hypothesize that underlying&#xD;
      genetic factors are at least partially explanatory. We aim to employ a phenotypic extremes&#xD;
      approach to rapidly ascertain severely and mildly affected COVID-19 patients for genomic&#xD;
      interrogation to identify germline and somatic variants that may play a role in host&#xD;
      susceptibility to disease to correlate those phenotypic extremes with genetic variants. We&#xD;
      will employ both a rare and common variant approach, using both genome sequencing and SNP&#xD;
      chip analysis and B and T cell repertoire interrogation.&#xD;
