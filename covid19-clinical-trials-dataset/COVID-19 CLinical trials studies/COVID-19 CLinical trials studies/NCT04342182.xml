  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive immunization with immunoglobulins is occasionally used as therapy for the treatment&#xD;
      of viral infectious diseases. Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and&#xD;
      is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies,&#xD;
      and hepatitis B virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present&#xD;
      in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the&#xD;
      2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed&#xD;
      that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly&#xD;
      increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates&#xD;
      showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With no proven effective therapy against COVID, this study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of convalescent plasma from COVID-recovered donors as a treatment for hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic COVID-19. The study will focus on patients who tested positive for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in the last 96 hours before inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Decrease overall mortality in patients within COVID disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized between the&#xD;
      infusion of 300mL of convP with standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PCR confirmed COVID disease, age &gt;18 years Donors will be included with a known&#xD;
      history of COVID who have been asymptomatic for at least 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 300mL of convP Duration of treatment: ConvP will be given as a one-time&#xD;
      infusion Duration of follow up: For the primary endpoint: until discharge or death before day&#xD;
      60, whichever comes first. For the secondary endpoints (with separate consent) up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target number of patients: 426 Target number of donors: 100 Expected duration of accrural: 36&#xD;
      months&#xD;

      Secondary (exploratory) objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml convP on hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the change of the 8-point WHO COVID19 disease severity scale on day 15 and 30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the change of the 8-point WHO COVID19 disease severity scale on day 15 in the&#xD;
           subgroup of patients with a baseline neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT50) &lt;80&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml convP on mortality in patients admitted to the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml plasma therapy on hospital days for patients admitted to&#xD;
           the ICU within 24 hours after admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of plasma therapy on the decrease in SARS-CoV2 shedding from airways&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the difference in effect of convP on mortality in patients with a duration of&#xD;
           symptoms &lt; or &gt; the median duration of symptoms in the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of CTL and NK cell immunity on the likelihood of being protected&#xD;
           from immune serum transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of convP therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of covP on long-term lung function&#xD;
