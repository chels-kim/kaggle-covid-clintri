  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are trying to see whether a self-collected saliva swab in the home setting is as good as&#xD;
      or better than a study clinician-collected anterior nose swab in evaluating whether you are&#xD;
      positive for COVID-19 or Influenza A/Influenza B. You may have no symptoms, so you may be&#xD;
      positive and capable of spreading the infection to others and you don't know it. Knowing&#xD;
      whether you are positive is important because you would have to quarantine and not go out to&#xD;
      prevent spreading the infection to others.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In some research studies, saliva has been shown to be as good as or even better than an&#xD;
      anterior nares or nasopharyngeal specimen in detecting SARS-CoV-2; we are interested in&#xD;
      making sure that is the case. Being able to collect a specimen at home and mail it in would&#xD;
      help with patient compliance and would reduce the need for clinicians (nurses or other health&#xD;
      care professionals) to use personal protective equipment (PPE), which is in short supply.&#xD;
      Also, people would not have to go to a healthcare facility or other testing site to have the&#xD;
      COVID-19 or the Influenza A/Influenza B testing done. We are using a sensitive method&#xD;
      (RT-PCR) to look for the three viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have had the anterior nose swab collected by the study clinician, your participation&#xD;
      would last only as long as it takes to complete the self-collected saliva collection and&#xD;
      return the sample to the researchers. The self-collection of the saliva specimen should be&#xD;
      collected as soon as possible after the collection of anterior nares and saliva samples by&#xD;
      the clinician You will mail in the saliva swab in a prepaid mailer no later than 10 days&#xD;
      after sample collection and the result will be available within one day of our lab receiving&#xD;
      the swab. Once our lab receives your specimen, the gift card which you received will be&#xD;
      activated and your participation will be complete. Biocerna, LLC (Fulton, Maryland), is the&#xD;
      commercial laboratory to which the research subjects' samples will be shipped and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate approximately 500 subjects will be enrolled. You qualify because you live in a&#xD;
      location which is reporting an increased number of COVID-19 positive cases. Incidence of&#xD;
      Influenza A/Influenza B is also useful to track to find out whether social distancing and/or&#xD;
      wearing masks decreases the number of Influenza A/Influenza B cases during the winter months.&#xD;
