      The investigators aim to understand the variation in pharmacological therapies for the&#xD;
      management of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India and compare it to the&#xD;
      recent available evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has proven to be the greatest medical emergency of recent&#xD;
      times. The evidence on the therapeutics has evolved significantly in last few months after&#xD;
      initial use of re-purposed drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to understand the current practices in the management of&#xD;
      adults severe COVID-19 in India.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has proven to be the greatest medical emergency of recent&#xD;
      times. The response of the medical world to this crisis has been unprecedented. The&#xD;
      healthcare workers are caring for patients at the frontline while, scientists and researchers&#xD;
      are discovering vaccines or effective treatment in shortest possible duration. The scale and&#xD;
      effect of pandemic in India, being second most populous country of the world is enormous. As&#xD;
      of December 30, 2020, India has crossed 10 million cases and 148,000 deaths from COVID-19.&#xD;
      India has second most number of cases only after United States of America (USA) and with&#xD;
      third largest number of deaths. The Ministry of Health and family Welfare (Under Government&#xD;
      of India) has given periodical clinical management guidelines, with last updated on July 5,&#xD;
      2020 (version 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults, severe COVID-19 is defined as presence of any of the following dyspnea, a&#xD;
      respiratory rate of 30 or more breaths per minute, a blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% or&#xD;
      less, a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (Pao2:Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg, or infiltrates in more than 50% of the lung field while&#xD;
      Critical COVID-19 is defined as presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),&#xD;
      sepsis or septic shock. The mortality in critical COVID-19 is reported to be 25-49% in&#xD;
      different studies. The evidence on the therapeutics for COVID-19 has evolved significantly in&#xD;
      last few months after initial use of re-purposed drugs. There are no recent guidelines&#xD;
      available based on the current evidence for clinical management of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are planning for nation-wide multicentre cross-sectional survey on&#xD;
      understanding participating physicians practices on choice of different pharmacotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents available in India as of January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to understand the current practices of participating&#xD;
      physicians in the management of adult patients with severe COVID-19 in India and to determine&#xD;
      future priorities.&#xD;
