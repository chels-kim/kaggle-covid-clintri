  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to implement methods that healthcare providers can use&#xD;
      across diverse clinical settings to (1) identify athletes at risk for (musculoskeletal) MSK&#xD;
      injury when cleared to return to play (RTP) after a concussion and (2) develop practical ways&#xD;
      to reduce MSK injury risk following concussion RTP. The rationale is that once&#xD;
      post-concussion MSK injury risk factors are known and prevention strategies tested,&#xD;
      concussion RTP protocols will evolve to include injury risk reduction programs.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To determine the effect of a sports injury prevention program on MSK injuries initiated at&#xD;
      concussion RTP and continued throughout the subsequent athletic season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To examine the effect of a neuromuscular training (NMT) program on clinical and&#xD;
      instrumented postural control measures before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will use an intervention-based paradigm to further understand MSK injury&#xD;
      risk after concussion RTP and to identify potential methods to reduce this risk. Common Data&#xD;
      Element (CDE) and instrumented postural control data will be linked to objectively classify&#xD;
      the clinical and functional underpinnings of concussion recovery and subsequent MSK injury&#xD;
      among those engaged in an injury prevention program compared to those who are not. These are&#xD;
      important elements to investigate because: 1) few studies have explored the mechanisms for&#xD;
      MSK injury incidence after concussion using a multimodal and objective approach and 2) no&#xD;
      investigations have examined interventions to improve long-term concussion outcomes initiated&#xD;
      at RTP.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Upon clearance to Return to Play (RTP) after concussion, all participants will be randomized to either a Neuromuscular training (NMT) group or usual care (no sports injury prevention training). Those in the NMT group will complete training for 20-30 minutes, two times per week, beginning at RTP and continuing at this frequency until the end of the current athletic season.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A brief generalized quality of life questionnaire. We will calculate the sub-scale scores for the domains of Mobility, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, Peer Relationships, and Pain Interference. Each sub-scale is calculated as a sum of 4 questions, rated from 0-4. Thus, each subscale is from 0-16, where a 16 indicates a greater presence of the domain being measured.</description>

    <description>A brief questionnaire about fear of movement and injury related to returning to sport. The subject answers 18 questions rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). There is a total sum score ranging form 18-72, where a higher score represents more fear of movement.</description>
