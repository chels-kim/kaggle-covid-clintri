    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, China and then the rest of the world have been affected by the rapid&#xD;
      development of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus&#xD;
      2). The disease caused by this coronavirus (COVID-19), which is transmitted by air via&#xD;
      droplets, is potentially responsible for a severe respiratory syndrome but also for a&#xD;
      multivisceral deficiency that can lead to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients are generally more susceptible to infections than people without cancer due&#xD;
      to immunosuppression caused by their tumor disease and/or conventional anti-cancer treatments&#xD;
      used such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, several targeted therapies, radiotherapy or recent&#xD;
      surgery. These patients may therefore be at particular risk for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is suggested by the very first analysis on the subject, which reports data from the&#xD;
      Chinese prospective database of 2007 patients with proven COVID-19 infection in 575 hospitals&#xD;
      in 31 Chinese provinces. The authors of this publication conclude with 3 measures to be&#xD;
      proposed to patients undergoing cancer follow-up: 1/ consider postponing adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy or surgery in the case of localized and stable cancer, 2/ reinforce protective&#xD;
      measures for these patients, and 3/ monitor very closely and treat these patients more&#xD;
      intensively when they have a COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe forms of COVID-19 in cancer&#xD;
      patients suggested by this first study remains to be demonstrated given its limitations,&#xD;
      already highlighted by other authors. Indeed, the number of patients is small and the&#xD;
      population of cancer patients is very heterogeneous, with in particular 12 patients out of 16&#xD;
      who had recovered from initial cancer treatments (therefore without immunosuppression), half&#xD;
      of whom had a disease course of more than 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a second Chinese study has just recently been published, reporting COVID-19&#xD;
      data among 1524 cancer patients admitted between December 30, 2019 and February 17, 2020 in&#xD;
      the Department of Radiotherapy and Medical Oncology of the University Hospital of Wuhan, the&#xD;
      source city of the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the rate of CoV-2 SARS infection was lower&#xD;
      than that reported in the first study, it was still 0.79% (n=12), which is much higher than&#xD;
      the rate of COVID-19 diagnosed in Wuhan City during the same period (0.37%, 41 152/11 081&#xD;
      000). Again, lung cancer was the main tumour location observed in 7 patients (58%), of which&#xD;
      5 (42%) were undergoing chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy. Three deaths (25%) were reported.&#xD;
      Patients over 60 years of age with lung cancer had a higher incidence of COVID-19 (4.3% vs.&#xD;
      1.8%). Thus, it appears that the risk of COVID-19 is actually increased in cancer patients,&#xD;
      although again, less than half of the patients with lung cancer had a higher incidence of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, two more recent studies performed in patients treated in Hubei Province of China&#xD;
      and in New-York city found that patients with cancer had significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      death compared to non-cancer COVID-19 patients, especially patients with metastatic cancer&#xD;
      and those who had recent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, many questions remain to date on the level of risk and the severity of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      patients with active cancer, in particular those under anti-cancer treatment and in patients&#xD;
      recently operated for localized cancer.&#xD;

      droplets, is potentially responsible for a severe respiratory syndrome but also for a&#xD;
      multivisceral deficiency that can lead to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In less than 3 months, the COVID-19 epidemic has already affected more than 440,000 persons&#xD;
      and has been responsible for more than 20,000 deaths worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients are generally more susceptible to infections than people without cancer due&#xD;
      to immunosuppression caused by their tumor disease and/or conventional anti-cancer treatments&#xD;
      used such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, several targeted therapies, radiotherapy or recent&#xD;
      surgery. These patients may therefore be at particular risk for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is suggested by the very first analysis on the subject, which reports data from the&#xD;
      Chinese prospective database of 2007 patients with proven COVID-19 infection in 575 hospitals&#xD;
      in 31 Chinese provinces. After exclusion of 417 cases without sufficient available clinical&#xD;
      data, 1590 cases of patients infected with COVID-19 were analysed, of which 18 (1%) had a&#xD;
      personal history of cancer. This prevalence was higher than that of COVID-19 in the general&#xD;
      Chinese population since the beginning of the epidemic (0.29%). Lung cancer (n=5, 28%) and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (n=5, 28%) were the 2 most common cancers. Four (25%) of the 16 patients&#xD;
      for whom treatment was known had received chemotherapy or had surgery in the month prior to&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, while the majority (n=12, 75%) were patients in remission or cured of&#xD;
      their cancer after primary surgery. Compared to patients without cancer, patients with cancer&#xD;
      were older (63 years vs. 48 years) and had a more frequent history of smoking (22% vs. 7%).&#xD;
      Most importantly, patients with cancer had more severe forms of COVID-19 than patients&#xD;
      without cancer (7/18 or 39% vs. 124/1572 or 8%, p=0.0003). Patients who had chemotherapy or&#xD;
      surgery in the month preceding the diagnosis of COVID-19 had a significantly increased risk&#xD;
      of the severe form (3/4 or 75% vs. 6/14 or 43%), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis&#xD;
      after adjustment on other risk factors such as age, smoking and other comorbidities, with a&#xD;
      relative risk of 5.34 (95% CI: 1.80-16.18;p=0.0026). Finally, patients with cancer&#xD;
      deteriorated more rapidly than patients without cancer (13 days vs. 43 days, p&lt;0.0001). The&#xD;
      authors of this publication conclude with 3 measures to be proposed to patients undergoing&#xD;
      cancer follow-up: 1/ consider postponing adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery in the case of&#xD;
      localized and stable cancer, 2/ reinforce protective measures for these patients, and 3/&#xD;
