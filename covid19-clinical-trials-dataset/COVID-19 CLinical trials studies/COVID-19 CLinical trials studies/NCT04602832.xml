      This study is a randomized controlled trial of an online, evidenced-based intervention (the&#xD;
      ENHANCE program) that was modified to address the health and well-being challenges of&#xD;
      COVID-19. Eligible participants will be randomized into the ENHANCE or Wait-List Control&#xD;
      group over a 12-week period. ENHANCE participants will be introduced, and asked to practice,&#xD;
      10 evidenced-based principles and skills of happiness and well-being. Participants will&#xD;
      complete an online survey about their health and well-being at baseline, midway (or 6 weeks),&#xD;
      post-assessment (or at the end of the 12-week study), and 3-months following the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a 12-week, two-armed, randomized controlled trail to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of a COVID-19-modified version of the Enduring Happiness and Continued&#xD;
      Self-Enhancement (ENHANCE) program. The ENHANCE program represents a 12-week multi-construct,&#xD;
      evidenced-based intervention for improving overall happiness and subjective well-being. The&#xD;
      ENHANCE program was modified specifically to address the known health and well-being&#xD;
      challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized into either the ENHANCE program or Wait-List Control&#xD;
      (WLC) group. ENHANCE participants will be introduced to 10 evidenced-based principles that&#xD;
      have been shown to improve health and well-being outcomes. Participants will be further&#xD;
      guided to systematically practice these principles in their daily lives using a small-changes&#xD;
      approach. WLC participants will be asked to continue life a usual, and provided some&#xD;
      additional health and well-being resources that can be accessed online to support current,&#xD;
      ongoing distress, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete an online survey about their emotional, social, and&#xD;
      physical well-being at baseline (or at the start of the study), midway (or 6-weeks into the&#xD;
      study), and at post-assessment (or at the end of the study period). At the end of the study&#xD;
      period, all control participants will also be offered the full ENHANCE program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that participants receiving the ENHANCE program will show improvements&#xD;
      across all negative (e.g., depression, anxiety) and positive (e.g., life satisfaction,&#xD;
      quality of life) variables from baseline to post-study. Investigators further expect there to&#xD;
      be immediate positive health and economic outcomes linked to active participation in the&#xD;
      ENHANCE program (versus the WLC group). Investigators believe the impacts of this research&#xD;
      will include (a) mitigating the risk of a severe onset of mental health problems related to&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicide, (b) increasing positive mental&#xD;
      health and well-being, and (c) increasing physical health in participants across time.&#xD;

    <description>The ENHANCE program was tailored to address the current health and well-being challenges faced by individuals living in the COVID-19 pandemic. The contents of each week will focus on a new evidenced-based principle that has been shown in research to decrease negative thinking and emotions, as well as increase positive thinking, emotions, and overall physical and mental health and well-being. Each week participants will focus on the skills and methods of implementing happiness and well-being into their daily routine.</description>
