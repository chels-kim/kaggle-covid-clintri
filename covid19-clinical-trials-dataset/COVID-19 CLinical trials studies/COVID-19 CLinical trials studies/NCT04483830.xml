      Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID- 19 pandemic has not only affected our healthcare system, but the impact on the&#xD;
      worldwide financial systems and our &quot;normal&quot; way of life is still to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the percentage of patients infected with COVID-19 that need hospital care is low,&#xD;
      Its high rate of contagiousness makes the total number of patients in need of hospital care&#xD;
      cripple any healthcare system, limiting the space available for other patients in need of&#xD;
      critical care, who cannot be admitted or even prefer not to attend the hospital in fear of&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early investigations report an Increase risk of thromboembolic complications, and a systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response not clearly understood. There is a possible vascular endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction due to chronic comorbidities (Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, lung disease) as a risk factor for a more severe presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulodexide is a two-compound drug, each of them with different endothelial action that can be&#xD;
      beneficial in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycosaminoglycans: Can help restore venous and arterial endothelial glycocalyx which can&#xD;
      downregulate or limit the response to inflammatory molecules, by maintaining the integrity&#xD;
      lost in certain chronic diseases (high blood pressure, diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin compound: It has an antithrombotic effect that could help reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications, and also add to the anti-inflammatory response due to it&#xD;
      anti-thrombin action (similar or a bit less to that of low molecular weight heparin) with&#xD;
      less risk of major bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a medication that can be used orally with minimal adverse effects and is less expensive&#xD;
      than low molecular weight heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that sulodexide instituted early in populations at significant risk and&#xD;
      symptomatic patients affected with COVID-19 (shortness of breath, fever, weakness, diarrhoea)&#xD;
      and risk factors of diabetes, hypertension, COPD, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
      will provide improvement in endothelial integrity, decrease inflammatory responses, and&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes with decreased hospital admission, decrease VTE and arterial&#xD;
      complications, morbidity, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use sulodexide in patients that have early onset of COVID-19 symptoms to mitigate the&#xD;
      progression of the disease process that can allow them to recover at home, and limit the need&#xD;
      of hospital care and a more severe clinical manifestation&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use sulodexide in patients that have early onset of COVID-19 symptoms to mitigate the&#xD;
      progression of the disease process that can allow them to recover at home, and limit the need&#xD;
      for hospital care and the more severe manifestation which includes fulminant respiratory&#xD;
      failure, acute kidney injury, cardiomyopathy, and thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 positives in the early but symptomatic stages of the disease (fever, cough,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, malaise, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anosmia). High risk of developing&#xD;
      a severe presentation of the disease (due to chronic comorbidities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology Prospectively, information collection will be carried out in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients, who are in early stages of the disease, defined as a beginning of symptoms of 3&#xD;
      days or less, who attend the CLINEDEM medical unit, located in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora,&#xD;
      Mexico, in the period from June 15, 2020, to 30 August 2020. Demographic and clinical data&#xD;
      will be collected digitally and physically and kept in the clinical record individually the&#xD;
      researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical, prospective, one-centre, randomized, controlled study. The collaboration&#xD;
      of the participants in the protocol will be a minimum of 3 weeks. Selection Period: the time&#xD;
      during which candidates will be reviewed, selected, and randomized. Contact will be made with&#xD;
      primary health services, both government and private, for a prompt reference of suspected&#xD;
      cases, contact with family members of known COVID-19 patients to seek evaluation if&#xD;
      developing symptoms, and social media recruitment. Candidates will be evaluated for inclusion&#xD;
      criteria by the researcher (or the assigned person), explain the protocol, confirm the&#xD;
      availability and/or willingness to participate, the signature of informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained for follow-up and laboratory sampling, from then on patients will be considered&#xD;
      inscribed in the clinical trial. The physician (or assigned person) will collect general&#xD;
      demographic information, relevant medical history, measurement of patient weight and height&#xD;
      for body mass index (BMI) calculation, send to a clinical laboratory that will perform&#xD;
      baseline examination blood samples, and COVID-19 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 groups will be formed: Group A: COVID-19 positive patients with early-stage symptoms who&#xD;
      will receive placebo doses of sulodexide. Group B: COVID-19 positive patients with&#xD;
      early-stage symptoms receiving doses of sulodexide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period: time from when patients initiate the oral dose of sulodexide. Patients in&#xD;
      groups A and B will receive the recommended initial stage treatment protocol which consists&#xD;
      of rest, measures of home isolation, and use of acetaminophen in case of pain or fever. if&#xD;
      the participant is indicated another medicine by their treating physician, it will be&#xD;
      recorded in their file, but will not be an elimination criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: will be granted supply for 7 days of placebo medicine in the same packaging and&#xD;
      appearance as the original sulodexide. A first follow-up appointment will be scheduled, which&#xD;
      will be made according to the participant's preference, either virtually (phone, cell phone,&#xD;
      videoconference) or physically with a visit to the patient's home by the researcher or a&#xD;
      study collaborator, which will be repeated every 7 days for 21 days, questions will be asked&#xD;
      about the general health condition and will report adverse symptoms related to drug intake.&#xD;
      During this period, extra visits will be made at the request of the patient or consideration&#xD;
      of the investigator. At each visit, symptomatic progression will be asses. At the end of the&#xD;
      21 days, a control blood sample will be carried out including dimer-D and C-reactive protein&#xD;
      and the study variables will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of need for hospital care, the authorization will be requested from the physician is&#xD;
      charged to obtain daily information about the general evolution during the stay, without&#xD;
      interfering with the specific treatment protocol. This information will be collected and&#xD;
      emptied into a database electronically and physically. Despite being part of the initial&#xD;
      informed consent, follow-up authorization will be confirmed during a hospital stay, which can&#xD;
      be denied at any time by the patient or family member, in case the participant is not in a&#xD;
      position to make decisions. The use of a placebo will be ruled out at that time. Group B: the&#xD;
      same protocol as group A + Sulodexide dose of 500 LRU will be added every 12hrs (two&#xD;
      capsules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to prevent or minimize bias: Control group will be receiving a placebo.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed according to the Castor EDU computing program. Only the&#xD;
      research leader will be known as randomization allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature interruption of the study: The study may be suspended prematurely if significant&#xD;
      safety problems are detected, if new scientific knowledge arises, or if other conditions&#xD;
      arise that place subjects at undue risk if they continue in the study. The sponsor or the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or the competent&#xD;
      authorities may terminate the study before its scheduled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug compliance The dates of the first and last intake, as well as any interruption of&#xD;
      treatment, if any, will be recorded in the participant's file. The number of tablets&#xD;
      dispensed and the number of tablets returned by the participant must be counted by the&#xD;
      researcher or a designated person on his/her team and registered. If the participant does not&#xD;
      bring back their medication box, the number of tablets taken and the number of days in which&#xD;
      the means have been applied will be estimated by the investigator interrogating the&#xD;
      participant. If the information is available on an upcoming visit, the data should be&#xD;
      corrected. Compliance will be evaluated weekly for the duration of your participation.&#xD;
      Compliance shall be calculated based on the relationship between the number of tablets taken&#xD;
      and the theoretical number of tablets required by the number of treatment days. If compliance&#xD;
      is not satisfactory during the study (e.g. less than 80% or more than 120%), the participant&#xD;
      should be questioned to identify the reason for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universe With a population in the area of San Luis Rio Colorado and its surroundings&#xD;
      approximately 1,000,000. 60% in the age range between 20 and 70 years and 55% female sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is difficulty in defining the current number of positive cases given the presence of&#xD;
      asymptomatic carriers of the disease, as well as a lack of openness for diagnostic tests in&#xD;
      the health sector, limiting an adequate sample calculation required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A COVID-19 patient has an 80% probability of developing a self-limited presentation that will&#xD;
      not warrant hospital care, but in the presence of comorbidities, the risk can increase. This&#xD;
      trial is focused on high-risk patients that can develop the need for hospital care given by&#xD;
      the calculator risk assessment software, increasing the risk of hospital care in our&#xD;
      population to 30-50%. In the severe presentation, the risk of mechanical ventilation can be&#xD;
      20% and a 6.7% mortality rate, however, these data can be modified according to different&#xD;
      countries and by the presence of risk factors given by chronic commodities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico, as of June 07, 2020, the national mortality rate is reported at 11.8% and in the&#xD;
      state of Sonora of 9.7%. In the town of San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, of the cases confirmed&#xD;
      37.7% has required hospital management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined using G*Power 3.1.9.2 program by taking an error type I with a&#xD;
      value of 5% (alpha-0.05), a type II error of 20% (beta-0.20) giving a 95% confidence value&#xD;
      and a statistical power of 80%. Obtaining a No. 102 participants per group to which 10% was&#xD;
      added for possible patient loss/abandonment by defining a total sample of 112 patients per&#xD;
      study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The data will be emptied into Excel sheets (Office 360, Microsoft) and&#xD;
      transferred to the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 (IBM) operating&#xD;
      program for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study looks for a superior effect in group B (sulodexide) compared to group A (control),&#xD;
      a significant level will be set to 5% (p &lt; 0.05) with a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive variables will be presented as mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum&#xD;
      for continuous data, and a number of cases and percentages for categorical data. The student&#xD;
      t-test and chi-square will be used to compare the differences between the two groups&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variable Classification Dependents: the need for hospital care, days needed supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen, need for hemodialysis, need for mechanical ventilation, mortality, presence of major&#xD;
      bleeding, presence of thromboembolic complications, Serum levels of D- dimer, serum levels of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, serum levels of creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent: Use of sulodexide General precautions of sulodexide: If anticoagulants are used&#xD;
      simultaneously, the doses of the anticoagulants should be readjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictions on use during pregnancy and lactation: Although fetal toxicity studies did not&#xD;
      show embryo or fetal-toxic effects, use during pregnancy or lactation is not recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary and adverse reactions: Epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash have rarely&#xD;
      been reported. Local manifestations have occasionally been reported at the site of redness&#xD;
      injection or small bruising. In control group research, the frequency of side effects is&#xD;
      similar to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events and other situations relevant to the safety of participants should be&#xD;
      followed and documented completely and accurately to ensure that the sponsor has the&#xD;
      information necessary to continuously assess the benefit-risk balance of the Clinical Trial.&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined as any unfavourable medical occurrence in a subject participating&#xD;
      in a clinical study, whether or not there is a causal relationship with the medicinal product&#xD;
      understudy, and/or experimental procedures, which occur or are detected from the date on&#xD;
      which the participant signs the consent form, regardless of the study period (e.g. the&#xD;
      selection period, they also refer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an adverse event may be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any unwanted signs, including an abnormal finding of an additional examination&#xD;
           (laboratory tests, x-rays, ECG, etc.) that is considered clinically relevant by the&#xD;
           researcher&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any symptoms or illnesses not related to the underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and Regulatory Aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helsinki Declaration from the World Medical Association: The Global Medical Association has&#xD;
      promulgated the Helsinki Declaration as a proposal for ethical principles for medical&#xD;
      research in humans, including research of identifiable human material and information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to ethical principles for medical research in human beings, the physician has to&#xD;
      protect life, health, dignity, integrity, the right to self-determination, privacy and&#xD;
      confidentiality of information; Following this principle, the confidentiality of the&#xD;
      information will be maintained the participating patients, only medical and administrative&#xD;
      personnel related to the protocol will have access to the clinical record where the patient's&#xD;
      name and information are located. For third parties who require access to the data, mainly&#xD;
      for the final statistical analysis or collaboration of some information regarding the study,&#xD;
      this will be sent, subject to authorization by the principal investigator, but under special&#xD;
      coding that replaces the name of the participant and not including personal-work information&#xD;
      not related to the study.&#xD;
