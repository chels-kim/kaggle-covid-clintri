  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of clinical features suggest the possibility of dysautonomia in patients infected&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, there is now strong experimental evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can cross the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier, probably via the olfactory nerves, and reach the brain stem, which is&#xD;
      located in close proximity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Damage to the brainstem nuclei could explain the suspected dysautonomic episodes, but also&#xD;
      the severity of respiratory distress in infected patients, and the difficulty of ventilatory&#xD;
      withdrawal encountered in resuscitation, potentially through damage to the ventilation&#xD;
      control and regulation centers located in the brainstem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to record the long term variability in heart rate, reflecting&#xD;
      autonomic balance, of patients screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 throughout their stay in&#xD;
      conventional care units at the Saint-Etienne University Hospital, in order to see whether&#xD;
      there is an autonomic imbalance at screening, whether the worsening of the autonomic&#xD;
      imbalance precedes the worsening of the clinical condition, and how quickly the expected&#xD;
      correction of the autonomic imbalance follows or precedes that of the disease.&#xD;

      In this study, patients will have a continuous recording of their heart rhythm via a&#xD;
      holter-ECG throughout their hospitalization.&#xD;
