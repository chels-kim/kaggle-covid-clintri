    <textblock>
      The Nancy Cov-H-AKI: study is a prospective, non-randomized, monocenter study performed in&#xD;
      patients hospitalised for either the severe or the critical form of Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the Nancy Cov-H-AKI study is to evaluate the association of variations&#xD;
      (from inclusion to 72H post-inclusion) of 5 blood-based cardio-vascular-renal biomarkers&#xD;
      selected a priori, cardiac (NT-proBNP), coagulation (D-dimers), related to the renin&#xD;
      angiotensin aldosterone system (ACE2) and renal (Penkid, and NGAL) with the appearance of&#xD;
      acute kidney injury KDIGO grade 1 or higher OR cardiac injury in patients hospitalised for&#xD;
      either the severe or the critical form of Covid-19&#xD;

      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the association of the concentrations at inclusion AND of the variations (between&#xD;
      inclusion and 72H post-inclusion) of blood and urine cardiovascular-renal biomarkers of&#xD;
      interest (selected a priori: cardiac (NT-proBNP, (bio)-Adrenomedullin), coagulation&#xD;
      (D-dimers), linked to the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (renin, ACE2, Angiotensin 2),&#xD;
      inflammatory (ceramides), oxidative stress, and renal (PENKID, cystatin C) and renal&#xD;
      glomerulo-tubulopathy ( renal functional exploration in blood and urine, and AKI (blood&#xD;
      (NGAL, KIM-1) and urinary (IGFBP7-TIMP2)) biomarkers, AND WITHOUT a priori by an analysis of&#xD;
      184 blood protein biomarkers in connection with cardiovascular and inflammatory damage * )&#xD;
      with the appearance of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AKI KDIGO grade 1 or higher or elevation of troponin &gt;99th percentile in hospitalisation&#xD;
           (approach with AND without a priori)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AKI KDIGO grade 1 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Elevation of troponin &gt;99th percentile in hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Elevated serum creatinine &gt;30% in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Chronic renal failure (eDFG &lt;60 ml / min / 1.73m2) three months after discharge from&#xD;
           hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure,&#xD;
           cardiovascular death) and mortality in hospital and at three months after discharge from&#xD;
           hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Considering future exploratory analyses (biological collection of plasma, serum, saliva,&#xD;
           urine, viruses) (for example other OLINK panels) on the previous endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin), Cystatin C, Kidney Injury&#xD;
                Molecule-1 (Kim-1), ACE-2, renin, Brain-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP),&#xD;
                Adrenomedullin, FGF (fibroblast growth factor-23 are all included in the 2 Olink&#xD;
                panels &quot;CVDII&quot; (https://www.olink.com/products/cvd-ii-panel/: listing) and&#xD;
