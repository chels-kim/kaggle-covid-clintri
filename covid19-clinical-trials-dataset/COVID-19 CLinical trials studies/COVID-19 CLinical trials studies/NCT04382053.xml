  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open label multi-center study to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of DFV890 for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia and impaired respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening / Baseline visit (Day -1 to 1): lasts up to a maximum of 24 hours and comprises a&#xD;
      screening / baseline assessment. This visit will be used to confirm that the study inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria are met and serves as baseline assessment prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period (Day 1-15): Participants in the investigational treatment arm will receive&#xD;
      DFV890 orally or via a nasogastric feeding tube administered for a total of 14 days in&#xD;
      addition to SoC. Study drug will be supplied in tablet form which can be crushed, allowing&#xD;
      for both oral and nasogastric administration. Participants in the control arm will receive&#xD;
      SoC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized as soon as possible, but within a maximum of 24 hours after&#xD;
      screening in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DFV890 in addition to SoC or SoC alone. Study&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted every 2 days for hospitalized participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The End of Treatment (EOT) visit will take place on Day 15. If participants are discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital prior to Day 15, assessments on the day of discharge should be performed&#xD;
      according to the schedule listed under Day 15; participants will continue to take the&#xD;
      investigational treatment at home to complete the 14-day treatment period and the&#xD;
      participants should return to the site for the Day 15/EOT assessment (all other visits&#xD;
      between discharge and Day 15 can be omitted). If a hospital visit is not possible at Day 15,&#xD;
      then home nursing services may be used to support this last visit where these are available&#xD;
      in accordance with local guidelines and should include all possible assessments (e.g., oxygen&#xD;
      saturation with portable monitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (Day 16-29): After completion of the 14 day- treatment period, participants will be&#xD;
      observed until Day 29 or discharged from hospital, whichever is sooner. Study assessments to&#xD;
      be conducted every 2 days for hospitalized participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are discharged from hospital prior to Day 29, a study visit conducted by&#xD;
      telephone will occur on Day 29 (all other visits between discharge and Day 29 can be&#xD;
      omitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-day safety follow-up assessment (Day 45): A follow-up visit for safety will be conducted&#xD;
      by telephone.&#xD;

    <measure>APACHE II severity of disease score on Day 15 or on the day of discharge (whichever is earlier)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The APACHE II (&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II&quot;) is a severity-of-disease classification system. An integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. Worst case imputation for death will be applied.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. For a standard CRP test, a normal reading is less than 10 milligram per liter (mg/L). It will be analyzed on a log-scale fitting a repeated measures mixed model including treatment group, study day, the three stratification factors and log transformed baseline CRP as a covariate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical status over time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical status is measured with the 9-point ordinal scale. The scoring is - Uninfected patients have a score 0 (no clinical or virological evidence of infection). - Ambulatory patients (not in hospital or in hospital and ready for discharge) can have a score 1 (no limitation of activities) or 2 (limitation of activities). - Hospitalized patients with mild disease can have score 3 (no oxygen therapy defined as SpO2 ≥ 94% on room air) or 4 (oxygen by mask or nasal prongs). - Hospitalized patients with severe disease can have score 5 (non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen), 6 (intubation and mechanical ventilation) or 7 (ventilation + additional organ support - pressors, RRT (renal replacement therapy), ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)). - Patients who die have a score 8.</description>
