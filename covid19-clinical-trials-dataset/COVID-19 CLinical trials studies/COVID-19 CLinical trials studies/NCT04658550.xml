  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has created fear, financial difficulties and interruptions in the lives&#xD;
      of patients and healthcare providers. As a result, many patients suffering from chronic&#xD;
      conditions such as obesity have had their treatment disrupted by the pandemic. The Bariatric&#xD;
      Medical Weight Management Clinic at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton transitioned its weight&#xD;
      loss and maintenance counselling classes to a remote (online) platform in response to the&#xD;
      pandemic. The remote weight loss and maintenance classes allows patients to continue&#xD;
      receiving treatment for obesity from their homes. The remote weight loss and maintenance&#xD;
      program is conducted on a safe platform that has been thoroughly reviewed and approved by St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Privacy Committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to learn whether the remote weight loss and maintenance classes can&#xD;
      lead to similar weight loss compared to the in-person weight loss and maintenance classes&#xD;
      that were offered to patients before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also aims to gather&#xD;
      feedback about the program to improve its delivery and patients' experiences.&#xD;

      The COVID-19 pandemic has created fear, financial difficulties and interruptions in the lives&#xD;
      of patients and healthcare providers. As a result, many patients suffering from chronic&#xD;
      conditions such as obesity have had their treatment disrupted by the pandemic. The Bariatric&#xD;
      Medical Weight Management Clinic at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton transitioned its&#xD;
      behaviour modification program, also known as weight loss and maintenance counselling&#xD;
      classes, to a remote (online) platform in response to the pandemic. The remote weight loss&#xD;
      and maintenance classes allow patients to continue receiving treatment for obesity from their&#xD;
      homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 26-week, single-centre, mixed retrospective and prospective, observational study&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of counselling in a remote setting compared to an in-person setting&#xD;
      in achieving weight loss among adult patients with obesity enrolled in the behaviour&#xD;
      modification program. This study also aims to gather feedback about the program to improve&#xD;
      its delivery and patients' experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 120 patients participating in the behaviour modification program and providing&#xD;
      informed consent will be observed in this study. This study involves a prospective and&#xD;
      retrospective component. The prospective component will be an observational study of 60&#xD;
      subjects who will receive 26-weeks of weight loss and maintenance counselling in a remote&#xD;
      setting and a low-calorie meal replacement as part of their usual care. The retrospective&#xD;
      component will involve using historical data from 60 subjects who received 26-weeks of weight&#xD;
      loss and maintenance counselling in an in-person setting and a low-calorie meal replacement&#xD;
      as part of their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters measured as part of standard of care at the start and end of the program, such as&#xD;
      body weight, blood pressure and lab tests will be collected for analysis of study endpoints.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a satisfaction survey at the end. There will be&#xD;
      no blinding of patients, study investigators, or data analysts.&#xD;
