    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate the levels of common psychopathology symptoms (i.e.,&#xD;
      depression and generalized anxiety) in a general population during the strict social&#xD;
      distancing government-initiated non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's) related to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. The study also seeks to examine the predictors of generalized anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, as well as predictors of adherence rates to government-initiated&#xD;
      non-pharmacological epidemiological interventions (NPI's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform the policymakers, the general public, scientists, and health practitioners about&#xD;
           the psychological associations of the COVID-19-related government-initiated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a foundation for policymakers and health-care professionals to employ&#xD;
           interventions that protect the general public against possibly increased psychological&#xD;
           stressors, suffering and dysfunction during society's handling of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help policymakers better understand the associations of demographic variables and&#xD;
           psychological symptoms with adherence, providing an initial understanding of adherence&#xD;
           rates, which may be used to help society fight against the COVID-19-virus from an&#xD;
           epidemiological perspective by promoting factors that increase adherence.&#xD;

      distancing government-initiated non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's) related to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. The study also seeks to examine the predictors of generalized anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, as well as predictors of adherence rates to government-initiated&#xD;
      non-pharmacological epidemiological interventions (NPI's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform the policymakers, the general public, scientists, and health practitioners about&#xD;
           the psychological associations of the COVID-19-related government-initiated measures.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypotheses related to general psychopathology - Depressive and anxiety symptom levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. H1: Social distancing measures related to the pandemic (NPI's) are associated with&#xD;
           increased depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in the general population, as&#xD;
           revealed through comparisons with prevalence rates of GAD and depression during from&#xD;
           other benchmark studies with similar sample during non-pandemic periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory: Investigate the differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety&#xD;
           symptoms across different demographic subgroups in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. H2: The demographic variables gender, age, relationship status and education level will&#xD;
           be significant predictors of psychopathology (i.e., depression and anxiety), with women&#xD;
           revealing higher symptoms, younger adults and single individuals revealing more severe&#xD;
           symptoms, and those with higher education levels revealing less severe symptoms of&#xD;
           anxiety and depression. Presence of self-reported psychological diagnosis will be a&#xD;
           significant predictor of depression and anxiety symptoms, with those reporting having a&#xD;
           diagnosis predicted to reveal higher symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. H3: Involuntary job loss and autonomy frustration will significantly predict higher&#xD;
           psychopathology levels, with those loosing their job involuntary and those who feel a&#xD;
           lack of autonomy reporting higher levels of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. H4: Perceived competence, sufficient information access, and stress concerning longer&#xD;
           isolation period will significantly predict psychopathology, with the former two being&#xD;
           associated with lower symptom levels, and the latter associated with larger symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. H5: Higher levels of coping behaviors such as doing positive things not done otherwise;&#xD;
           experiencing nature; as well as being engaged in physical activity will be associated&#xD;
           with lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses related to adherence to government-initiated non-pharmacological interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. H1: Given previous factors related to adherence in previous pandemics, such as access to&#xD;
           information and trust in one's government, the investigators predict high rates of&#xD;
           adherence to government-initiated non-pharmacological measures (i.e., most of the&#xD;
           respondents will adhere to NPI's nearly every day), in Norway, where both public&#xD;
           resources and governmental trust has been revealed as high.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. H2: The demographic variables gender, age, education level, and employment status will&#xD;
           be significant predictors of adherence to NPI's, with women, older adults and those with&#xD;
           higher education levels revealing higher rates of adherence, whereas those who are&#xD;
           currently employed will reveal lower rates of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. H3: Self-chosen vs. instructed social distancing and altruism will be significant&#xD;
           predictors of adherence to NPI's, with the those self-choosing to distance themselves&#xD;
           revealing lower adherence rates, and those with high scores on altruism revealing higher&#xD;
           adherences levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. H4: The situational variables sufficient access to information and difficulty to work&#xD;
           from home will be significant predictors of adherence, with the first being associated&#xD;
           with higher rates of adherence, and the latter with lower rates of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. H5: Health anxiety, fear of significant others being infected, and fear of infecting&#xD;
           others will be associated with higher rates of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Additionally, the investigators will exploratory investigate whether the&#xD;
      following variables are related to adherences rates, namely; depression levels, GAD levels,&#xD;
      whether one suspects being infected the by COVID-19-virus, and worry about extended duration&#xD;
      of NPI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple linear regression will be used to assess theorized predictors in three multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis with: 1) Depressive symptom levels as the DV; 2) Generalized anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms as the DV; and the last multiple regression analysis with 3) levels of adherence as&#xD;
      the DV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific predictors of increased depressive levels and specific hypotheses for the multiple&#xD;
      regression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gender: Women will report higher depressive levels, as consistently found in the&#xD;
           psychopathology literature (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001; Thayer et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age: Younger subjects will report poorer mental health symptoms than older subjects, as&#xD;
           previously found by a large epidemiological Scandinavian study (e.g., Molarius et al.,&#xD;
           2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relationship/Marital Status: Individuals in a relationship will experience less&#xD;
           depressive symptoms as highlighted by previous studies (e.g., LaPierre, 2009; Zhang &amp;&#xD;
           Li, 2010). Being married versus single has been reported as a reduced risk for most&#xD;
           mental disorders in both genders (e.g., Scott et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Education Level: Lower education levels is associated with increased depressive symptoms&#xD;
           (Lorant et al., 2003; Molarius &amp; Granström, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Involuntary job loss related to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether one is currently&#xD;
           employed or not: Involuntary job loss will be associated with higher levels of&#xD;
           depressive symptoms, as highlighted in other studies (e.g., Gallo et al., 2006; Kim &amp;&#xD;
           Knesebeck, 2016). This is further based on The Economic Stress hypothesis, where job&#xD;
           loss has been related to increased symptoms of psychological disorders (e.g., Castalano&#xD;
           &amp; Dooley, 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Lack of autonomy: Based on Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory, the investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that Autonomy Frustration will significantly predict depressive symptoms,&#xD;
           with higher reports of Autonomy Frustration being associated with higher levels of&#xD;
           depressive symptoms. Thus, those who socially distance themselves voluntary will&#xD;
           experience less adverse psychological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Perceived Competence: Based on associations competence and symptoms of depression and&#xD;
           anxiety (e.g., Tindall &amp; Curtis, 2019), the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
           self-perceived competence will significantly predict depressive levels, with higher&#xD;
           levels of perceived competence being associated with lower levels of depressive&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sufficient access to information: In line with previous findings (e.g., Brooks et al.,&#xD;
           2020), the investigators hypothesize sufficient access to information to be an important&#xD;
           protector against psychological distress, predicting that sufficient access to&#xD;
           information will be associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Stressors connected to the duration of the non-pharmacological pandemic measures: As&#xD;
           stress about longer isolation and quarantine periods have been associated with poorer&#xD;
           mental health (e.g., Brooks et al., 2020), the investigators hypothesize this variable&#xD;
           as a significant predictor of depressive levels, where increased stress concerning&#xD;
           longer social distancing period will be associated with higher levels of depressive&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Psychological diagnosis: As the nature of receiving a diagnosis according to the DSM,&#xD;
           involves the co-occurrence of multiple symptoms within a symptom-cluster (i.e.,&#xD;
           disorder), the investigators wish to control for psychological diagnosis in the multiple&#xD;
           regression, where the investigators expect to see psychological diagnosis as a&#xD;
           significant predictor of depressive levels, with those reporting a diagnosis revealing&#xD;
           larger levels of depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following established three protective variables will also be included in the&#xD;
           multiple regression analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Physical acitvity&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Experiencing nature&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Doing positive things not done otherwise during social distancing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific predictors of increased generalized anxiety levels and specific hypotheses for the&#xD;
      multiple regression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gender: the investigators hypothesized that gender will be a significant predictor of&#xD;
           GAD, with women being associated with higher scores of GAD symptoms, as highlighted in&#xD;
           other epidemiological studies (e.g., Grant et al., 2007; Hunt et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age: Younger subjects will report poorer mental health symptoms than older subjects, as&#xD;
           previously found by similar large epidemiological Scandinavian studies (e.g., Molarius&#xD;
           et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relationship/Marital Status: the investigators hypothesize that being in a relationship&#xD;
           is associated with decreases in generalized anxiety symptoms, as found elsewhere (e.g.,&#xD;
           Scott et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Education Level: The investigators hypothesize education to be a significant predictor&#xD;
           of generalized anxiety symptoms, with higher education levels is associated with&#xD;
           decreased GAD symptoms, as found in other epidemiological studies in Norway (Bjelland et&#xD;
           al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Involuntary job loss related to the COVID-19 pandemic whether one is currently employed&#xD;
           or not: Involuntary job loss leads to increased GAD symptoms, based on previous findings&#xD;
           on unemployment and anxiety symptoms (e.g., Westman, 2004) and based on The Economic&#xD;
           Stress hypothesis, where job loss has been related to increased symptoms of&#xD;
           psychological disorders (e.g., Castalano &amp; Dooley, 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Lack of autonomy: Based on Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory, the investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that Autonomy Frustration will significantly predict depressive symptoms,&#xD;
           with higher reports of Autonomy Frustration being associated with higher levels of&#xD;
           generalized anxiety symptoms. Thus, those who socially distance themselves voluntary&#xD;
           will experience less adverse psychological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Perceived Competence: Based on associations competence and symptoms of depression and&#xD;
           anxiety (e.g., Tindall &amp; Curtis, 2019), the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
           self-perceived competence will significantly predict generalized anxiety levels, with&#xD;
           higher levels of perceived competence being associated with lower levels of generalized&#xD;
           anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sufficient access to information: In line with previous findings (e.g., Brooks et al.,&#xD;
           2020), the investigators hypothesize sufficient access to information to be an important&#xD;
           protector against psychological distress, predicting that sufficient access to&#xD;
           information will be associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Stressors connected to the duration of the non-pharmacological pandemic measures: As&#xD;
           stress about longer isolation and quarantine periods have been associated with poorer&#xD;
           mental health (e.g., Brooks et al., 2020), the investigators hypothesize this variable&#xD;
           as a significant predictor of generalized anxiety levels, where increased stress&#xD;
           concerning longer social distancing period will be associated with higher levels of&#xD;
           generalized symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Psychological diagnosis: As the nature of receiving a diagnosis according to the DSM,&#xD;
           involves the co-occurrence of multiple symptoms within a symptom-cluster (i.e.,&#xD;
           disorder), the investigators wish to control for psychological diagnosis in the multiple&#xD;
           regression, where the investigators expect to see psychological diagnosis as a&#xD;
           significant predictor of generalized anxiety levels, with those reporting a diagnosis&#xD;
           revealing larger levels of generalized anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following established three protective variables will also be included in the&#xD;
           multiple regression analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Physical acitvity&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Experiencing nature&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Doing positive things not done otherwise during social distancing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific predictors of adherence and specific hypotheses for the multiple regression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gender: Consistent with previous findings revealing gender differences in compliance and&#xD;
           conformity to rules (e.g., Cooper, 1979; Costa et al., 2001; Weisberg et al., 2011), the&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that compliance rates will be higher for women as compared to&#xD;
           men. There has been mixed evidence in terms of demographic and employment&#xD;
           characteristics with regards to adherence (Webster et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age: the investigators hypothesize that older adults will reveal higher rates of&#xD;
           compliance, as consistent with previous findings on general risk perception and&#xD;
           age-related differences in risk-taking (e.g., Rolison et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Educational level: In accordance with previous studies (e.g., Hakes &amp; Viscusi, 2004)&#xD;
           finding that higher levels of education is associated with more accurate risk&#xD;
           perception, the investigators hypothesize that those with higher education in the sample&#xD;
           are to be associated with higher adherence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Altruism: Altruism has been theorized as a potentially important variable in relation to&#xD;
           increase of adherence (e.g., Brooks et al., 2020; Webster et al., 2020). The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize altruism to be a significant predictor of adherence, with&#xD;
           higher levels of altruism being associated with higher levels of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Self-chosen versus instructed social distancing: The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
           those who chose themselves to distance themselves in contrast to those instructed to be&#xD;
           in quarantine or isolation have lower levels of adherence, as reported in a previous&#xD;
           study related to SARS (e.g., DiGiovanni et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Employment status: In accordance with previous findings from the SARS pandemic reported&#xD;
           by Porten et al. (2006), the investigators hypothesize current employment status&#xD;
           (whether the individuals work or not) to be related to adherence, with those in work&#xD;
           revealing less adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sufficient access to information: The investigators hypothesize that reports of&#xD;
           sufficient information access will be a predictor of compliance, with more higher levels&#xD;
           of reported access to information associated with higher levels of compliance, as found&#xD;
           in other studies (Braunack-Mayer et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2006; Webster et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Stressors connected to the duration of the non-pharmacological pandemic measures:&#xD;
           Exploratory. The investigators will exploratory investigate how stress about longer&#xD;
           duration of pandemic measures is related to adherence levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Difficulty to work from home: The investigators hypothesize that those finding it&#xD;
           difficult to work from home will reveal lower levels of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Transmitting others: The belief of transmitting others has previously been found to&#xD;
           increase adherence rates (DiGiovanni et al., 2004). The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
           this belief will be a significant predictor of adherence, with higher degrees of belief&#xD;
           associated with higher degrees of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Fear of significant other being infected by the virus: The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           that fear of significant other being infected by the virus will be related to higher&#xD;
           adherence levels, based on evolutionary kin selection theory (Hamilton, 1964) which&#xD;
           includes the desire to protect and ensure the survival of ones nearest family and&#xD;
           relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Health anxiety: The investigators hypothesize that those with health anxiety symptoms&#xD;
           will report higher rates of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Depression: Exploratory. The investigators aim to exploratory investigate GAD levels and&#xD;
           their relationship to adherence in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. GAD: Exploratory. The investigators aim to exploratory investigate depressive levels and&#xD;
           their relationship to adherence in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Suspect Covid: Some studies (e.g., Teh et al., 2012) have found that individuals br eak&#xD;
           quarantine to seek medical attention, given that they suspect an infectious disease. It&#xD;
           could also be possible that those suspecting COVID will stay home. The investigators&#xD;
           thus have no specific hypothesis in terms of direction, but only that Suspecting COVID&#xD;
           will be a significant predictor of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires including demographic&#xD;
      variables, psychological symptoms, situational factors related to the consequences of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus, personality-trait and psychological needs variables, beliefs and fears&#xD;
      related to COVID-19, as well as adherence to government-initiated non-pharmacological&#xD;
      epidemiological measures (NPI's), in a random order. Some questionnaires are given as a&#xD;
      whole, whereas other questions includes theoretically-driven selections of items from&#xD;
      validated questionnaires, with the goal of avoiding topological overlap. This study is part&#xD;
      of a 'The Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence Project' involving multiple&#xD;
      studies. In order to not overwhelm and burden the participants with long questionnaire, and&#xD;
      due to the mentioned empirical concerns of topological overlap (i.e., overlap in item&#xD;
      content) between similar items (for network analysis purposes in some of the studies in the&#xD;
      mentioned large-scale project), in some scales involving large item-content overlap, single&#xD;
      items where chosen in a theory-driven manner by three independent clinical psychologists and&#xD;
      clinical specialists in adult psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection started during the time-period with the strictest and equal number of&#xD;
      government-initiated non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's) in Norway, and data collection&#xD;
      was stopped once these NPI's were modified or new information about NPI's were added. The&#xD;
      data include one directly identifiable variable (contact information) for participants in&#xD;
      accordance to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law in EU, which is to give the&#xD;
      participants the opportunity to have their data deleted upon request. Data are thus kept on a&#xD;
      safe server belonging to the University of Oslo and will be accessed first following&#xD;
      de-identification. Stopping rule for data collection: Stopping rule: 1) At once if&#xD;
      government-initiated NPI's are modified or novel information are given about NPIs (to control&#xD;
      for cognitive variables) and/or 2) once the study reached enough participants given the power&#xD;
      analysis (10000 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures (as mentioned above under specific hypotheses):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHQ-9; GAD-7; Adherence to the eight government-initiated NPI's in Norway; demographic&#xD;
      variables (gender; age; relationship/marital status; employment status; education level);&#xD;
      situational variables related to Covid-19 (Whether respondent Lost Job Because of Covid-19&#xD;
      consequences; sufficient access to information; stress/worry about NPI's duration lasting&#xD;
      longer; whether it is self-choice to stay at home/socially isolate or one has been instructed&#xD;
      to be in quarantine/isolation; whether one suspects having COVID; fear of transmitting&#xD;
      others; fear of significant others being infected by COVID; difficulty to work from home);&#xD;
      person-trait variables (Autonomy frustration; Perceived Competence); and whether one has a&#xD;
      psychological diagnosis or not; protective factors (Physical activity; doing positive things&#xD;
      not done otherwise; experiencing nature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome variables are PHQ-9; GAD-7; and total score of the adherence levels to the NPI's.&#xD;
      The other variables are predictors of these three outcome variables. Kindly see above&#xD;
      (hypotheses section) for exactly which predictors that belong to which outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given Acceptable Cronbach's alpha (Cronbach's alpha &gt;= 0.7), the investigators will combine&#xD;
      four variables that measure health anxiety and fear of death related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the large sample size in this study, the investigators pre-define their significance&#xD;
      level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      p &lt; 0.001 to determine significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mentioned 'Norwegian COVID-19, Mental Health and Adherence Project' involves multiple&#xD;
      studies, where some involve a Complex Systems (Network analysis) approach. These mutlivariate&#xD;
      analyses require large samples and power analysis was conducted accordingly. Following power&#xD;
      analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer (2017), it is recommended that the number of&#xD;
      participants be at the very least three times larger than the number of estimated parameters.&#xD;
      However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975) for multivariate research,&#xD;
      recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of estimated parameters.&#xD;
      Thus, with the more conservative estimates by Roscoe, an optimal sample size included&#xD;
      slightly above 10000 individuals. According to the stopping rule mentioned above, due to the&#xD;
      importance of keeping the NPI variable constant, the investigators would stop data collection&#xD;
      even if the investigators did not obtain the target N. Fortunately, sufficient sample was&#xD;
      reached during a period with identical NPIs across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the participants were reached:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include The general population of adults (Age &gt;= 18) from all regions (i.e.,&#xD;
      counties) of Norway, having equal opportunity and the probability of partaking in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the time-sensitivty of the project and the strict and time-consuming process of getting&#xD;
      approval to access registry data, the investigators did not apply for access to registry data&#xD;
      (e.g., address, phone or e-mails of the general population), as such data access is highly&#xD;
      strict and regulated in Norway and the time-frame of such an application could have&#xD;
      encompassed variation in an important variable the investigators wished to hold constant&#xD;
      (namely identifical NPIs (non-pharmacological interventions) employed over the time-frame of&#xD;
      data collection). Thus, the investigators did not apply for registry data, but still&#xD;
      attempted to obtain a probability sample through the means elaborated below. The&#xD;
      investigators reached out to the general Norwegian population systematically in the following&#xD;
      six ways, with the goal of providing the entire adult population an equal opportunity to be&#xD;
      exposed to the survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Through broadcasting on the main national news channel of Norway which had nearly 1.1&#xD;
           million viewers at the time of broadcast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using Facebook Business Advertisement where the investigators exposed all adult&#xD;
           Norwegian Facebook users (3.6 million; 85% of the Norwegian adult population) with an&#xD;
           equal opportunity of being exposed to the survey in a random manner. The survey reached&#xD;
           a random selection of nearly 180 000 of the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Broadcasting the survey on national and region radio stations across the country&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Broadcasting about the survey on local radio stations across the country&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Using national newspaper to reach out to participants about the survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Using regional and local newspapers to reach out to participants across all regions and&#xD;
           counties in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the Facebook-adverts alone reached out to a random sample of 85% of Norways adult&#xD;
      population (a population of 3.6 million on Facebook out of 4.2 million adults in the&#xD;
      country). The investigators argue that the probability is high that the survey reached out to&#xD;
      the residual 15% not on facebook, through the 5 other channels - including the national news&#xD;
      channel of Norway with 1.1 million viewers at the time of broadcast, as well as regional and&#xD;
      local newspapers. As at least one of the present outreach methods includes reaching out&#xD;
      randomly to participants across the adult population of Norway, the investigators judge the&#xD;
      sampling technique to be equal to that of that of access to registry data, which would simply&#xD;
      involve doing the same (selecting a random set of participants) with the difference being&#xD;
      that participants receive the voluntary survey in their physical mail-box rather than&#xD;
      digitally. Both the presently used digital method and the more commonly used physical&#xD;
      technique (registry data) involve voluntarily participation, thus not necessarily involving&#xD;
      different response rates. Consequently, both involving techniques involve a random reach out&#xD;
      to participants, and the investigators judge the present sampling technique to be comparable&#xD;
      to that of random sampling with registry data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical models:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three multiple regression analyses will be conducted; one with PHQ-9; the second with GAD-7;&#xD;
      and the third total score of adherence to NPI's as the dependent variable. Specific&#xD;
      predictors of each of these three multiple regression analysis are listed above (hypothesis&#xD;
      section). Multicollinearity and other assumptions will be checked; if the multicollinearity&#xD;
      assumption is violated (if VIF &gt; 5 and Tolerance &lt; 0.2; Hocking, 2003; O'Brian, 2007), for&#xD;
      example due to variables that may or may not overlap due to potential topological overlap&#xD;
      (e.g., Health anxiety and GAD symptoms), the investigators will remove health anxiety from&#xD;
      the model. However, as the investigators have approached the problem of topological overlap&#xD;
      and handled it in a theory-driven manner in the planning of the study through a discussion&#xD;
      panel with clinical experts, the investigators do not expect to see such problems with&#xD;
      multicollinearity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics with frequency tables including N, means and SDs and other standard&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will examine the hypothesis concerning general levels of depressive-&#xD;
      and anxiety symptoms, as well as adherence rates. The hypothesis concerning higher levels of&#xD;
      psychopathology (i.e., depressive- and anxiety symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic will be&#xD;
      checked by comparing the proportion that meets the cut-offs for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (each cut-off&#xD;
      = 10, as found in other studies) with benchmark studies from similar populations during&#xD;
      non-pandemic periods. GAD-7 has been validated in Norway, where the cut-off has been revealed&#xD;
      lower than cut-off found in other countries (i.e., GAD-7 cut-off = 8 in Norway, whereas it is&#xD;
      10 in other countries; (Johnson, Ulvenes, Øktedalen &amp; Hoffart, 2019). Consequently, as&#xD;
      validated benchmark studies exist within our population, the investigators will utilize the&#xD;
      Norwegian cut-off for GAD-7, but will also report the common cut-off proportion results&#xD;
      (i.e., cut-off = 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transformations Depending on degree of skewness compared to theoretical possibilities and&#xD;
      interpretations, variables will be assessed in their original and validated format as is&#xD;
      recommended practice, as long as this is possible. As this study examines psychopathology&#xD;
      levels amongst a general population (and not a clinical population), the investigators do&#xD;
      expect a skewed data on depressive and anxiety levels (with most individuals reporting low&#xD;
      levels of anxiety and depression). Given the validation of these questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9&#xD;
      and GAD-7) which are theoretically and empirically (i.e., validation studies) supposed to&#xD;
      yield accurate depressive and anxiety levels, it may not theoretically nor empirically make&#xD;
      sense to transform the data, although the investigators expect a skew. Similarly, due to&#xD;
      mentioned factors such as resources to disseminate information as well as governmental trust&#xD;
      in Norway (see above in hypothesis section), the investigators also expect skew in total&#xD;
      score of adherence, with most individuals revealing high adherence. This skew is expected.&#xD;
      Consequently, the investigators will attempt to assess these variables in their original and&#xD;
      validated format as is recommended practice, as long as this is possible with regards to&#xD;
      statistical assumptions. However, if this is not possible with regards to the statistical&#xD;
      assumptions behind the analyses, transformation (e.g., square root or log-transformations)&#xD;
      may be needed to apply interval-based methods. In any case, even though the parametric tests&#xD;
      planned in this study are robust against skewness, the investigators will examine the degree&#xD;
      of skewness and evaluate this against the assumptions and analyses before choosing the&#xD;
      appropriate analysis. The pre-registered and planned analyses include multiple regression, as&#xD;
      long as assumptions are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exploratory examine the differences in levels of depression and&#xD;
      generalized anxiety symptoms across different demographic subgroups in our sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exploratory investigate whether the following variables are related to&#xD;
      adherences rates, namely; depression levels, GAD levels, whether one suspects being infected&#xD;
      the by COVID-19-virus, and worry about being longer duration of NPI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also exploratory assess the correlation between Perceived Competence&#xD;
      in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis with the variable Sufficient Access to information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators may also do other exploratory analysis that the investigators have not yet&#xD;
      thought of at the time of pre-registration: if the investigators do such exploratory&#xD;
      analyses, the investigators will explicitly state them as exploratory in the published&#xD;
      manuscript following common publishing guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that this the project outline, study plan and analysis was registered upon application&#xD;
      to the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) and Norwegian Centre&#xD;
      for Research Data 10 days prior data collection, two committee which evaluate the rational&#xD;
      for data collection and hypotheses as well as evaluate the ethical aspects of the study&#xD;
      before allowing the data to be collected. The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov after&#xD;
      completed data collection, although this registration is prior to any analysis of the data.&#xD;
      The registration was first made on osf.io as this is the place were cross-sectional studies&#xD;
      usually are registered where it is still to be found, but was subsequently registered on&#xD;
      clinicaltrials as the investigators found out that it was possible to register&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies on clinicaltrials.gov (traditionally associated with clinical studies&#xD;
      and RCTs), reading the guidelines of the target journal for the present study.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer &amp; Williams, 2001) is used to measure symptoms of depression in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. The questionnaire consists of nine items where each is scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the range of scores from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, and scores above 10 are considered as the cut-off that indicating that the patient is within the depressive area.</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams &amp; Löwe, 2006) is a questionnaire consisting of seven items measuring symptoms of anxiety and worry. The items are scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the scores ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety severity, and scores that are above the cut-off of 10 are considered to be in the clinical range (Spitzer et al., 2006). Specific cut-off for Norwegian samples have been found yielding a cut-off of 8 and above for high sensitivity and specificity (Johnson, Ulvenes, Øktedalen &amp; Hoffart, 2019).</description>
