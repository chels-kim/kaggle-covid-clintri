      Female students of Taif University will be invited to participate in this study. 40 students&#xD;
      will be assigned according to sample size calculation into the study as having mild to&#xD;
      moderate anxiety and depression according to Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21)&#xD;
      most days of the week for at least six months. All study participants will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form. Screening for the physical activities in the last 7 days of all participants&#xD;
      will be performed one day before starting the study protocol using The International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) short form. The exclusion will be performed to severe&#xD;
      psychological conditions such as schizophrenia and severe depression and any physical&#xD;
      condition that limit physical activities. Also, participants who are taking any medications&#xD;
      for the treatment of anxiety and depression will be excluded. Also, participants who had any&#xD;
      abnormalities of the cardiovascular status that prevent them to perform the physical&#xD;
      activities or reaching the target heart rate without risk as recommended by their primary&#xD;
      care physician. The age range will be 18 to 25 years with a mean age of 21Â±0.75 years.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned into two groups: group A (GA) consists of 20 students and they&#xD;
      will be instructed to increase their physical activities one hour daily, 5 days per week for&#xD;
      8 weeks of moderate to vigorous activities such as running, jumping, swimming, aerobics or&#xD;
      dancing; and group B (GB) consists of 20 students and they will receive cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for 8 sessions (once per week for 8 weeks).&#xD;
