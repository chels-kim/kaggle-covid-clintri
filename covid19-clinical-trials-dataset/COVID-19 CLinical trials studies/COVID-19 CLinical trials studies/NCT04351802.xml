  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is designed to assess whether focused lung ultrasound examination&#xD;
      can improve the diagnosis of COVID-19 lung disease and/or make an alternative diagnosis at a&#xD;
      patient's initial hospital presentation. For patients with confirmed COVID-19 the study will&#xD;
      also assess whether surveillance lung ultrasound examination can predict clinical outcome&#xD;
      over the course of their hospital admission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be screened from and recruited on their entry into the suspected&#xD;
      COVID-19 admission pathway at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK. In addition to usual clinical&#xD;
      care (including physical exam and observations, blood tests, nasopharyngeal swab for viral&#xD;
      PCR testing, and chest x-ray as standard), participants will undergo focused lung ultrasound&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are negative for COVID-19 will be followed up to confirm their final&#xD;
      discharge diagnoses, and clinical outcome at either 3 months post-enrolment or discharge from&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are positive for COVID-19 will have regular focused lung ultrasound&#xD;
      examination during their hospital admission in addition to usual clinical care until their&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19 is complete. Their discharge diagnoses and clinical outcome at either&#xD;
      3 months post-enrolment or discharge from hospital (whichever is later).&#xD;
