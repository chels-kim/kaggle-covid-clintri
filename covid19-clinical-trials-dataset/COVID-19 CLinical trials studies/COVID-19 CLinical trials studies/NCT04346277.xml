      This protocol proposes to use IC14, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
      recognizing human CD14, to block CD14-mediated cellular activation in patients early in the&#xD;
      development of ARDS. The binding of IC14 to human CD14 prevents CD14 from participating in&#xD;
      the recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The putative mechanism of&#xD;
      action of IC14 in ARDS is blockade of PAMP and DAMP interactions with CD14, thus attenuating&#xD;
      the inflammatory cascade that leads to increased endothelial and epithelial permeability and&#xD;
      injury resulting in alveolar injury and fluid accumulation characteristic of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC14 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to CD14 with high affinity and inhibits&#xD;
      signaling via membrane and soluble CD14. Blocking CD14 with IC14 treatment in normal&#xD;
      volunteers strongly inhibits systemic inflammation in response to bacterial endotoxin (LPS).&#xD;
      University of Washington conducted a small NIH-funded pilot trial of IC14 treatment in 13&#xD;
      patients with ARDS, which suggested that IC14 treatment reduced alveolar inflammation and&#xD;
      decreased BAL cytokines. IC14 was also the subject of IND 105803 for a phase 2 study of ARDS&#xD;
      from all causes which we propose to revise for the COVID-19 indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dosing regimen for IC14 with favorable pharmacokinetics supporting once daily intravenous&#xD;
      dosing has been defined, making this an acceptable treatment for hospitalized patients. Two&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers can be used that are related to CD14, measurements of sCD14 (serum&#xD;
      at baseline; urine at baseline and follow up) as well as a CD14 fragment (sCD14-ST;&#xD;
      presepsin). A CD14 target engagement assay is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, because of the central role of CD14 in the amplification of lung inflammatory&#xD;
      responses leading to severe lung injury and the safety record of IC14 in humans, we propose&#xD;
      to have an open-label protocol to test the safety and potential efficacy of IC14 treatment in&#xD;
      preventing the progression of severe respiratory disease in patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use open label program in patients hospitalized with pulmonary&#xD;
      complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection who will receive IC14 at a dosage of 4 mg/kg on Day 1,&#xD;
      then 2 mg/kg once daily on Days 2-4. Patient monitoring will be for a total of up to 28 days&#xD;
      if the patient is still hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/baseline assessments and initiation of the first IC14 administration will occur&#xD;
      within 48 hours after meeting inclusion criteria. IC14 should be administered at&#xD;
      approximately 24-hr intervals beginning from the start time of the first IC14 administration&#xD;
      (Day 1).&#xD;
