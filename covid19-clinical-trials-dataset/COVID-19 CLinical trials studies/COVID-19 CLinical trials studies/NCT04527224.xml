    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Astrostem-V, allogenic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC), in patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 pneumonia. After each subject completes 12-Weeks visit (Visit 12) and the data&#xD;
      management team confirms all individual data have no issue, the individual database will be&#xD;
      locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Perform chest X-ray or CT every week (W1 - W4) after screening, baseline, and W4 followed by 2 - week intervals (W6, W8). The investigator of each clinical trial organ shall check chest X-ray or CT for bilateral shading and evaluate them.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SOFA score (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Check the SOFA score every week from the baseline to the W4 (W1 - W4) and 2 weeks after the W4 (W6, W8). The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) is a simple and clinically useful indicator that can be used to assess, predict, and monitor long-term failure in patients with multiple organ failure, and therefore increase in SOFA score can be expected to result in multiple organ failure and worse prognosis.</description>
