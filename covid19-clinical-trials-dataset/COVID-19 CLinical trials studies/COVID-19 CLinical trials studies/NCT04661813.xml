  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social distancing measures put in place to combat the COVID-19 disease pandemic may increase&#xD;
      social isolation and impact cardiovascular disease prevention behaviors among people living&#xD;
      with HIV (PLWH). This study builds on a previously developed nurse-led intervention to&#xD;
      improve blood pressure and cholesterol care for PLWH. The investigators will adapt the&#xD;
      intervention to be administered virtually in order to facilitate cardiovascular prevention&#xD;
      care within the US health care system which has sustained long-term changes as a result of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation and effectiveness of the intervention will be&#xD;
      tested in a 12-month single arm intervention study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social distancing in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and COVID-19 disease pandemic&#xD;
      may amplify isolation and loneliness due to the requirement to limit in-person interactions&#xD;
      with loved ones, friends, community members, healthcare providers, etc. Social isolation&#xD;
      increases susceptibility to illness, stress, hypertension, depression, and mortality and&#xD;
      decreases engagement in self-management and physical activity. People living with HIV (PLWH)&#xD;
      are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are particularly vulnerable to the&#xD;
      stress and social isolation caused by the public health measures to combat COVID-19. Using&#xD;
      mixed-methods and a human-centered design approach, the investigators will adapt a nurse-led&#xD;
      intervention to EXtend the HIV/AIDS TReatment cAscade for CVD prevention (EXTRA-CVD) so that&#xD;
      it is better suited to a post-COVID healthcare environment. This hybrid type 3 implementation&#xD;
      study will evaluate the implementation of a virtually enhanced EXTRA-CVD intervention to&#xD;
      improve BP control in PLWH from 3 HIV-specialty clinics in the United States [University&#xD;
      Hospitals, MetroHealth (both Cleveland, OH) and Duke Health (Durham, NC)]. The study will&#xD;
      enroll adult PLWH participants (n=75) on suppressive ART with high blood pressure whom are&#xD;
      otherwise ineligible for the parent trial (EXTRA-CVD; NCT03643705) because they do not also&#xD;
      have high cholesterol or because they are unwilling or unable to participate in the in-person&#xD;
      trial. Primary outcomes will be: reach (% agreeing to participate), effectiveness (change in&#xD;
      home systolic BP), and adoption (frequency of home BP use). Additional implementation&#xD;
      measures including feasibility, acceptability, and intention to maintain blood pressure&#xD;
      self-monitoring will be assessed qualitatively. This study will increase the impact and&#xD;
      scalability of the EXTRA-CVD intervention without compromising the integrity or feasibility&#xD;
      of the parent trial.&#xD;
