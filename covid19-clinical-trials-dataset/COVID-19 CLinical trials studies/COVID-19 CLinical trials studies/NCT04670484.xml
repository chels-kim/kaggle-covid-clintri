  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that the use of surgical masks can induce mild hypoxia with a low&#xD;
      level of activity (e.g. performing surgery). There is no evidence that this decrease in&#xD;
      oxygenation is clinically significant. The degree of hypoxia associated with surgical mask&#xD;
      use, N-95 mask use or the combination at rest and with exertion is unclear and warrants&#xD;
      further investigation, particularly given the current widespread use of both due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Our working hypothesis is that there is a decrement in oxygenation with&#xD;
      the use of any mask that is higher with an N-95 than a surgical mask and higher still when&#xD;
      wearing both and that this decrement is more pronounced with exertion than at rest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown some evidence of hypoxia associated with the prolonged use of a surgical&#xD;
      or N-95 mask. Despite this, the prolonged use of surgical and/or N-95 masks in the clinical&#xD;
      setting and surgical masks in the non-clinical setting is the current standard due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. The physiologic cost of wearing a respirator was demonstrated in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with mask use during heavy exertion associated with increased respiratory rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate. N95 use during light exercise increases CO2 intake reduces&#xD;
      inspired oxygen and increases the work of breathing. The physiologic effects of N95 fit&#xD;
      testing using a hood include higher CO2 levels and lower oxygen levels in the respirator. In&#xD;
      patients with ESRD, N95 mask use was associated with reduced PaO2 and increased respiratory&#xD;
      rate. The use of surgical masks for prolonged surgeries is associated with decreased SpO2 and&#xD;
      increased heart rate, particularly in those over 35 years old. Many studies have suggested&#xD;
      that there is a physiologic burden and risk of hypoxia associated with surgical and/or N95&#xD;
      mask use. This pilot study aims to compare baselines with each and both masks and with no&#xD;
      mask versus short-duration exertion, which has not yet been done per review of the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that the use of surgical masks can induce mild hypoxia with a low&#xD;
      level of activity (e.g. performing surgery) with prolonged use. There is no evidence that&#xD;
      this decrease in oxygenation is clinically significant. The degree of hypoxia associated with&#xD;
      surgical mask use, N-95 mask use, or the combination at rest and with exertion is unclear and&#xD;
      warrants further investigation, particularly given the current widespread use of both due to&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Our working hypothesis is that there is a decrement in oxygenation&#xD;
      with the use of a mask with exertion. The general public is being advised to wear a mask,&#xD;
      including those with pre-existing pulmonary disease and heart disease. If there is evidence&#xD;
      of a statistically significant decrease in oxygen saturation with short duration mask use&#xD;
      with exertion, then further studies on patients at risk for decompensation due to&#xD;
      mask-induced hypoxia is warranted. Our working hypothesis is that there is a decrement in&#xD;
      oxygenation with the use of a mask with exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-site study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects 18 years old and up wearing masks as personal protective equipment (measure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects younger than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant or women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy&#xD;
             test at the time of consenting. (If a pregnancy test has not been performed at the&#xD;
             time of consenting, the individual will be automatically excluded since a confirmed&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test is not available. We will not be able to provide the cost of&#xD;
             pregnancy test and will only rely on verbal confirmation from the subject that they&#xD;
             are not pregnant or have a -personally purchased standard of care- negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent cannot be obtained from the subject&#xD;
