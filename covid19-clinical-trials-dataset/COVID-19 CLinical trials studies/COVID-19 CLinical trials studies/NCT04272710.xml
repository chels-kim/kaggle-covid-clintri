      There are currently no clinical studies reporting clinical characteristics difference between&#xD;
      the hypertension patients with and without ACEI treatment when suffered with novel&#xD;
      coronavirus infection in China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Wuhan and Hubei&#xD;
      provinces has attracted great attention from the medical community across the country. Both&#xD;
      2019-nCoV and SARS viruses are coronaviruses, and they have a large homology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published laboratory studies have suggested that SARS virus infection and its lung injury are&#xD;
      related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lung tissue. And ACE and ACE2 in the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are vital central links to maintain hemodynamic stability and&#xD;
      normal heart and kidney function in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large amount of evidence-based medical evidence shows that ACE inhibitors are the basic&#xD;
      therapeutic drugs for maintaining hypertension, reducing the risk of cardiovascular,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular, and renal adverse events, improving quality of life, and prolonging life in&#xD;
      patients with hypertension. Recent experimental studies suggest that treatment with ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors can significantly reduce pulmonary inflammation and cytokine release caused by&#xD;
      coronavirus infection.&#xD;
