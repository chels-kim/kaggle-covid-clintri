  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of&#xD;
      pneumonia caused by CoVID-19, and the number of cases of infection with CoVID-19 identified&#xD;
      in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in&#xD;
      multiple other Provinces of China and internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given no specific antiviral therapy for CoVID-19 infection and the availability of Yinhu&#xD;
      Qingwen Decoction as a potential antiviral Chinese medicine based on vivo antiviral studies&#xD;
      in CoVID-19, this randomized,three-arm controlled, single-blind trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Yinhu Qingwen Decoction (Granula) in patients hospitalized with mild&#xD;
      or common CoVID-19 respiratory disease.&#xD;

      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of&#xD;
      pneumonia caused by CoVID-19, and the number of cases of infection with CoVID-19 identified&#xD;
      in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in&#xD;
      multiple other Provinces of China and internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical spectrum of CoVID-19 infection appears to be wide,including asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection, mild upper respiratory disease, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure,&#xD;
      and even death.However,there is no specific antiviral therapy for CoVID-19 infection, which&#xD;
      provides a window of opportunity for testing candidate antiviral therapies. Previous&#xD;
      experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need of the early intervention with Chinese&#xD;
      medicine, and so as for CoVID-19 infection. The treatment of Chinese medicine for CoVID-19&#xD;
      infection suggested its benefits to improve of clinical outcomes, reduce the risk of disease&#xD;
      progression, accelerate recovery, and reduce intensive supportive care and long-term&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yinhu Qingwen Decoction (Granula) consists of 11 common non-toxic traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine such as Polygonum cuspidatum, Honeysuckle, Nepeta, Ligustrum lucidum. Previous vivo&#xD;
      antiviral studies showed its activity for the inbition of CoVID-19. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      planned to evaluate the mean clinical recovery time for patients with mild and common&#xD;
      CoVID-19 infection as the primary outcome, and to evaluate the effect of the symptoms relief&#xD;
      and virus clearance as well as the clinical safety.&#xD;
