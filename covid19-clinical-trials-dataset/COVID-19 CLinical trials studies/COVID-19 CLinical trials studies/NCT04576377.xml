      The aims of this vaccine trial are: (1) to measure humoral and selected cellular immune&#xD;
      responses to repeated influenza vaccination with Flublok, including these responses'&#xD;
      associations with age, birth year, and prior vaccination history; (2) to identify the&#xD;
      characteristics of study participants who are vaccinated but still become infected with&#xD;
      influenza virus (&quot;vaccine failures&quot;) and participants who have poor immune responses to&#xD;
      vaccination; and (3) to predict how influenza vaccinations and infections shape immunity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Influenza vaccine is the most frequently used vaccine in the United States and&#xD;
      globally. Influenza vaccination provides variable protection against influenza virus&#xD;
      infection from year to year, with multiple factors contributing to variation in vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness. First, viral evolution necessitates regular updates to vaccine strains, and&#xD;
      the degree of match between vaccine and circulating strains affects vaccine protection. A&#xD;
      more serious issue, which motivates this study, is that repeated influenza vaccination may&#xD;
      lead to &quot;focusing&quot; of immune responses to older strains, potentially reducing protection&#xD;
      against recent strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives: The aims of this trial are: (1) to measure humoral and selected cellular&#xD;
      immune responses to repeated influenza vaccination, including these responses' associations&#xD;
      with age, birth year, and prior vaccination history; (2) to identify the characteristics of&#xD;
      study participants who are vaccinated but still become infected with influenza virus&#xD;
      (&quot;vaccine failures&quot;); and (3) to predict how influenza vaccinations and infections shape&#xD;
      immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A 4-year immunogenicity study with a randomized controlled design among 820&#xD;
      adults who are 18-49 years of age. Participants will be randomized to 5 groups in equal&#xD;
      proportions, where the groups will receive Flublok (Sanofi Pasteur) vaccine (V) or saline&#xD;
      placebo (P) in years 1-4: group 1: V+V+V+V; group 2: P+V+V+V; group 3: P+P+V+V; group 4:&#xD;
      P+P+P+V; group 5: P+P+P+P. All participants will receive influenza vaccination at the end of&#xD;
      the final year. The investigators will collect blood samples and nasal strip samples before&#xD;
      vaccination and various timepoints after vaccination. Whole blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      from a subset for later peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) analysis. The investigators&#xD;
      will actively monitor participants for acute respiratory illnesses throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      period, and collect and test respiratory swabs and blood samples to identify respiratory&#xD;
      virus infections and acute immune responses to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measures are the humoral immune responses at day&#xD;
      30 after vaccination measured by hemagglutinin inhibition and microneutralization assays. The&#xD;
      investigators will also study a number of secondary outcomes, including the persistence of&#xD;
      immune responses 91, 182, 273 and 365 days after vaccination, and the immune responses to&#xD;
      natural laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections, as well as immunity and immune&#xD;
      responses to other respiratory viruses including COVID-19 (SARS-CoV- 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential implications: Our study will provide novel insight into the effects of repeat&#xD;
      influenza vaccination and infection on the strength and breadth of immune responses to&#xD;
      influenza, the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in vaccine response and vaccine failure,&#xD;
      and biological factors that could explain variation in influenza vaccine effectiveness.&#xD;
