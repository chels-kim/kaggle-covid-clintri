      Agent Name and Study Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      ArtemiC is a medical spray comprised of Artemisinin (6 mg/ml), Curcumin (20 mg/ml),&#xD;
      Frankincense (=Boswellia) (15 mg/ml) and vitamin C (60 mg/ml) in micellar formulation for&#xD;
      spray administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive up to 6 mg Artemisinin, 20 mg Curcumin, 15 mg Frankincense and 60 mg&#xD;
      vitamin C given daily as an add-on therapy (in addition to standard care) in two divided&#xD;
      doses, on Days 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a manner of 2:1 for study drug (ArteminC) and Standard of Care&#xD;
      to Placebo and Standard of Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up will last 2 weeks. During this time, patients will be monitored for adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional time will be required for follow up (until hospital discharge) in order to check&#xD;
      side effects and study drug efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo, composed of the same solvent but without active ingredients, will be given in the&#xD;
      placebo group as add-on therapy, 2 times a day, on Days 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall rationale A preparation of ArtemiC, comprising Artemisinin, Curcumin, Boswellia, and&#xD;
      Vitamin C in a nanoparticular formulation, is proposed as a treatment for the disease&#xD;
      associated with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2. It is readily available in light of its&#xD;
      status as a food supplement. This initiative is presented under the urgent circumstances of&#xD;
      the fulminant pandemic caused by this lethal disease, which is known as COVID-19 and has&#xD;
      spread across the globe causing death and disrupting the normal function of modern society.&#xD;
      The grounds for the proposal are rooted in existing knowledge on the components and&#xD;
      pharmacological features of this formulation and their relevance to the current understanding&#xD;
      of the disease process being addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leading among these considerations are well established immuno-modulatory activities of the&#xD;
      active ingredients as established in vitro and in vivo and published over the years. These&#xD;
      activities as apparent, for example, in diminishing activity of TNF alpha and IL-6 levels are&#xD;
      acknowledged to be relevant to the pathophysiology processes involved in the progressive form&#xD;
      of COVID-19. The active agents have in addition prominent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory as&#xD;
      well as anti-aggregant and anti-microbial activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these activities and observations in animal models, together with clinical&#xD;
      experience of the separate ingredients and in various combinations in other contexts it is&#xD;
      proposed to evaluate their effect in the context of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ArtemiC on&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology 50 adult patients who suffer from COVID-19 infection studied in parallel groups&#xD;
      treated with active agent or placebo as add on to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed through collection and analysis of adverse events, blood and urine&#xD;
      laboratory assessments and vital signs.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ArtemiC on&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TREATMENT AND DESIGN 50 adult patients who suffer from COVID-19 infection, and do not&#xD;
      participant in any other clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient must agree to not participate in any new clinical study during the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ArtemiC is a medical spray combined of Artemisinin (6 mg/ml), Curcumin (20 mg/ml),&#xD;
      Frankincense (15 mg/ml) and vitamin C (60 mg/ml) in spray administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has a current status as a food supplement. Patients will receive up to 12 mg Artemisinin,&#xD;
      40 mg Curcumin, 30 mg Frankincense and 120 mg vitamin C in 2ml as a total maximum dose, given&#xD;
      as add-on therapy, comprised of 2 daily doses of 0.5 ml each, on Days 1 and 2. Each dose&#xD;
      contains 0.5 ml (total 1 ml daily dose), which is equal to 5 pushes on the spray bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo, composed of the same solvent but without active ingredients, will be given as add-on&#xD;
      therapy in the placebo group, 2 times a day, on Days 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a manner of 2:1 for study drug (ArteminC) and Standard of Care&#xD;
      to Placebo and Standard of Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 2 weeks. During this time, patients will be monitored for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional time will be required for follow up (until hospital discharge) in order to check&#xD;
      side effects and study drug efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the effect of oral administration of the study drug will be assessed by&#xD;
      determining the clinical and laboratory tests as summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemistry Blood Test: Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Chloride (Cl), Creatinine, Glucose,&#xD;
      Urea, Albumin, Calcium total, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, Direct&#xD;
      Bilirubin, LDH, Total Protein, Uric Acid, CRP, and Lipid Profile (including Total&#xD;
      Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides), D-dimer, ESR as well as Troponin as required.It will&#xD;
      be performed per institutional schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology Blood Test: complete CBC. It will be performed per institutional schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;

      institutional schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;

      will be performed per institutional schedule. All the above measurements will be performed by&#xD;
      the hospital staff, not necessarily by the principal investigator or the sub-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 Prior to engaging in any study procedures, the subject must meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria by history (which includes a declination), and review and sign&#xD;
