  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program&#xD;
      to patients with Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia in the post-acute period on pulmonary functions,&#xD;
      exercise capacity and anxiety level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients diagnosed with Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia will be enrolled in this prospective,&#xD;
      interventional study according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      and a personalized PR program will be organized before hospital discharge. After discharge,&#xD;
      the pulmonary rehabilitation program will continue in telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the telerehabilitation program, exercises will be supervised by a physiotherapist two days&#xD;
      a week, and patients will be asked to do the exercises themselves for the other 3 days.&#xD;
      Patients will also receive exercise videos for these 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 4 weeks and will be called for final evaluation&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Dyspnea level as measured by modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC scale is a self-rating tool to measure the degree of disability that breathlessness poses on day-to-day activities on a scale from 0 to 4. 0: no breathlessness except on strenuous exercise; 4: too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing.</description>

    <measure>Change in physical activity level as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) -Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IPAQ-Short Form is used to measure level of physical activity.It consists of 7 questions that provide information about time spent on walking, moderate to vigorous physical activities, and time spent sitting. The energy required for the activities was calculated by the MET-minute/week score. Standard MET values for these activities are: Walking = 3,3 METS; Moderate Physical Activity = 4,0 METS; Vigorous Physical Activity = 8.0 METS; Sitting = 1,5 METS</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety and depression as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.The total scores range is 0-21 for both depression and anxiety scores. A higher score indicates a worse depression and anxiety.</description>

In the telerehabilitation program, exercises will be supervised by a physiotherapist two days a week, and patients will be asked to do the exercises themselves for the other 3 days. Patients will also receive instructional exercise videos for these 3 days.</description>
