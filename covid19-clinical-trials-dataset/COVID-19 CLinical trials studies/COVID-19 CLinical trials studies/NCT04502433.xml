      The purpose of this Phase II -Proof of Concept study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of poractant alfa (Curosurf®), administered by endotracheal (ET) instillation in adult&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with SARS-COV-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a UK multicentre, open-label, randomized phase II proof of concept study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of poractant alfa will be evaluated in terms of ventilatory free days&#xD;
      during the 21 days after randomization, in adult patients with ARDS due to SARS-COV-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same evaluation is planned in a separate cohort of patients under extracorporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation (vvECMO) in terms of ECMO free days during the 21 days after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient randomized to the study treatment will receive three administrations of Curosurf&#xD;
      ® with a 24 hours dosing interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment collection will last until day 28 when the evaluation will occur at the ICU,&#xD;
      or by phone call if the patient has been discharged before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy patients will be randomized in the study with a ratio 3:2 (i.e. 42 patients in the&#xD;
      poractant alfa arm and 28 in the control arm). An additional exploratory cohort of 15&#xD;
      patients in ECMO will be randomised by 3 sites with a ratio 3:2 (i.e. 9 patients in the&#xD;
      poractant alfa arm and 6 in the control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm population is treated as per Standard of Care (SoC).&#xD;
