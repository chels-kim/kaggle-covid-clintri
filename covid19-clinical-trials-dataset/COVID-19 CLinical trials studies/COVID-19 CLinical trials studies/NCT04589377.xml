  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involves testing a brief mindfulness training program to reduce students'&#xD;
      psychological threat and support motivation, engagement, and learning in introductory&#xD;
      undergraduate physics courses. The investigators predict that, compared to a control&#xD;
      condition, mindfulness training will reduce psychological threat and increase motivation,&#xD;
      engagement, and learning in physics.&#xD;
