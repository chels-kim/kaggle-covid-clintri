  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn babies and children with congenital heart defects who need heart surgery need to be&#xD;
      placed on the heart-lung machine for heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to use the heart-lung machine, the investigators have to use blood and other fluids&#xD;
      to fill the tubing. During the operation, ultrafiltration is carried out as standard of care&#xD;
      to remove extra fluid. Modified ultrafiltration is also performed after surgery. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators are looking to use the filter additionally before surgery. Using the&#xD;
      pre bypass filtration before the subject is placed on the heart-lung machine will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to better normalize electrolytes in the blood/fluid mixture used in the heart&#xD;
      lung machine. This technique is called pre-bypass ultrafiltration, or PBUF (pronounced &quot;P&quot;&#xD;
      Buff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a study to see if using PBUF to better normalize&#xD;
      electrolytes in the blood will make a difference. The investigators have been adding fluids&#xD;
      to prime the heart-lung machine in two different ways. The investigators believe both methods&#xD;
      are safe and acceptable but hypothesize that there may be subtle differences in electrolytes&#xD;
      and fluid status when one technique is used as opposed to the other. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that neither technique introduces risk since both are currently used in practice. The&#xD;
      standard method adds blood to the heart-lung machine. The alternate method adds blood to the&#xD;
      heart-lung machine and then additional fluid is added and removed to more normalize the&#xD;
      electrolytes. The investigators plan to randomized subjects undergoing heart surgery to&#xD;
      receive the standard priming method versus PBUF to determine if there is any difference in&#xD;
      outcomes. Laboratory and clinical data collected as part of clinical care will be used to&#xD;
      determine difference sin outcomes. There will be no additional blood taken for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks to PBUF. The benefits include helping investigators determine if&#xD;
      PBUF does or does not make a difference to how subjects recover after surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that providing more normal blood values will either improve the&#xD;
      subjects' outcome or have no benefit. The investigators do not anticipate increased risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given COVID -19 restrictions, the study is on hold.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research question: Can PBUF provide more physiologic values for glucose, sodium, potassium&#xD;
      and lactate throughout the cardiopulmonary bypass period without an increased incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The values for glucose, sodium, potassium and lactate in blood primes for&#xD;
      subjects weighing less than 8 kg are known to be non-physiologic. The process of priming the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is not standardized across institutions and there are several&#xD;
      methods used to correct for known prime value issues. The investigators documented the prime&#xD;
      values for 20 subjects weighing less than 8 kg and then performed pre-bypass ultrafiltration&#xD;
      (PBUF) on the prime for those same circuits to achieve more physiologic prime values. The&#xD;
      investigators were cautious not to implement too significant of a change as the investigators&#xD;
      assessed the technique and documented that plasma-free hemoglobin importantly did not rise&#xD;
      and that measured osmolality was still slightly above the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: Prospective randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that pre cardiopulmonary bypass ultrafiltration&#xD;
      (PBUF) can provide more physiologic prime values for glucose, sodium, potassium and lactate.&#xD;
      Plasma-free hemoglobin will not increase with the technique. Osmolality will be maintained&#xD;
      slightly above the normal range. PBUF will not negatively impact clinical outcome measures&#xD;
      and may improve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 To determine if use of PBUF will result in more physiologic values for&#xD;
      glucose, sodium, potassium and lactate during and immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 To determine if PBUF can be achieved with no increase in plasma free&#xD;
      hemoglobin while maintaining plasma osmolality within acceptable range during and immediately&#xD;
      after cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 To determine if use of PBUF will result in improved clinical outcomes after&#xD;
      surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Prior to surgery, subjects will be randomized to one of the two study groups&#xD;
      using a randomly permuted blocks design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Analyses will be performed on an intention to treat basis. Comparisons&#xD;
      of subject characteristics and outcomes will be made using the two-sample t test or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. If&#xD;
      imbalances in patient factors exist between the two groups, linear and logistic regression&#xD;
      will be used to compare outcomes for the groups adjusting for these potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Sample size is calculated for comparisons of subjects in the normal&#xD;
      range of values for the PBUF and standard care groups. This will be done separately for&#xD;
      glucose, sodium, potassium, and lactate; each comparison will be performed at the 0.0125&#xD;
      level of significance. If 70% of standard care subjects are in the normal range versus 90% of&#xD;
      PBUF subjects, a total of 176 subjects (88 per group) would be required to achieve 80% power.&#xD;
      With 350 eligible subjects that meet inclusion criteria based on 2017 numbers and 75% consent&#xD;
      rate the investigators will be able to enroll 260 subjects in 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given COVID-19 restrictions, the study is on hold.&#xD;
