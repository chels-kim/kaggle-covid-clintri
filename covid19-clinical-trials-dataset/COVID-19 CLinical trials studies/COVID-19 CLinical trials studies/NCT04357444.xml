  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose interleukin 2 (Ld-IL2) administration&#xD;
      in improving clinical course and oxygenation parameters in patients with SARS-CoV2-related&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 25% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 infection presented life-threatening&#xD;
      respiratory conditions. Of these, 60% met ARDS criteria leading to death in 25% to 63% of the&#xD;
      cases. SARS-CoV2-related ARDS is caused by a massive inflammatory cell infiltration leading&#xD;
      to dysregulated cytokine/chemokine responses with lung immunopathological changes. To date,&#xD;
      there is no treatment available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells playing a crucial role in the&#xD;
      control of immune responses, in part by preventing excessive inflammation. Depletion of Treg&#xD;
      cells in models of lung infection or after berylium exposure exacerbated lung inflammation.&#xD;
      In contrast, a beneficial role for Treg during early ARDS and its resolution has been&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose interleukin 2 (Ld-IL2) is the first therapy driving Treg-specific expansion and&#xD;
      activation. Ld-IL2 was successfully tested in a wide range of preclinical models of&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, including beryllium-induced lung inflammation. Moreover, Ld-IL2 has&#xD;
      been shown to be safe and free of serious adverse events when administered in patients with&#xD;
      various autoimmune diseases. Importantly, in our previous work, we observed only very low&#xD;
      concentrations of IL-2 in the blood (0.1 pg/mL [0.0-2.0]) as well as in the BAL supernatant&#xD;
      (0.8 pg/mL [0.4-1.3]) collected from patients during the early phase of ARDS, suggesting that&#xD;
      additional IL-2 could be beneficial for Treg expansion/activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is therefore to investigate the therapeutic benefit of Ld-IL2 as a Treg inducer&#xD;
      for controlling SARS-CoV2-related ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission of patients to the intensive care unit at one of the recruiting centers, the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be checked by the investigating physician and participation in the&#xD;
      study will be proposed to the patient or parent/family member/trusted person. If the patient&#xD;
      is unable to consent and there is no parent/family member/trusted person, the patient may be&#xD;
      included in the emergency procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion (J0), the patient will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms (low dose&#xD;
      IL-2 or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental treatment will be daily administered to the patient from D1 to D10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be monitored daily until D28 during hospitalization.&#xD;
