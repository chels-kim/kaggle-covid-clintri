      Multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease&#xD;
      in patients treated or not with IMUNO TF ® and a combination of nutraceuticals and who have&#xD;
      tested positive in a COVID-19 diagnostic test based on the duration of symptoms.&#xD;

      SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION The primary objective of the study was to describe the course of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated or not with IMUNO TF® and a combination of&#xD;
      nutraceuticals and who have tested positive in a COVID-19 diagnostic test based on the&#xD;
      duration of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was established according to the ICH guidelines, where it was&#xD;
      specified that the number of patients should be sufficient to provide a safe response about&#xD;
      the issues raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean duration of mild/moderate symptoms of COVID-19 was 11.5±5.7 days. A sample of 18&#xD;
      patients would be sufficient to estimate, with a 95% confidence and a precision of +/- 2.8&#xD;
      days, a mean duration of symptoms with a standard deviation of 5.7 days. Assuming a loss of&#xD;
      10% of patients, the sample size was 20 patients. Considering the two groups of patients&#xD;
      (treated with IMUNO TF® / not treated with IMUNO TF®), the sample size was 40 patients, 20&#xD;
      patients per group. The calculations were performed with the help of the PASS package,&#xD;
      version 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROCESSING Study data were collected in a CRD and inserted the data in a database&#xD;
      specifically designed for the study. The database included internal consistency ranges and&#xD;
      rules to ensure data quality control.&#xD;

        It was planned to collect data from approximately 40 patients who had tested positive in a&#xD;
        diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2: 20 patients who have been treated with IMUNO TF® with a&#xD;
        combination of nutraceuticals and 20 patients who have not been treated with the&#xD;
        investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients who met the screening criteria and gave their informed consent to participate&#xD;
        were included consecutively.&#xD;
