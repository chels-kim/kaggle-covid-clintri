      Background The significant risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare staff mandated&#xD;
      changes to Basic and Advanced Life Support (BLS and ALS) guidelines. As advised by the&#xD;
      European Resuscitation Council (ERC), healthcare staff should put on airborne-precaution&#xD;
      personal protective equipment (PPE) before starting chest compressions and/or airway&#xD;
      interventions, as a minimum an FFP3 mask (FFP2 or N95 if FFP3 not available), eye and face&#xD;
      protection and long-sleeved gown. However, wearing FFP3 masks has been shown to highly impair&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and the effect of wearing PPE on the quality of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not known. The aim of this project is therefore to to&#xD;
      investigate whether wearing PPE has an effect on the quality of chest compressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study forsees a simulated CPR scenario on manikins. Study participants are lay&#xD;
      rescuers and members of the rescue organization Croce Bianca. Each participant will perform 5&#xD;
      sequences consisting of 2 min of chest compressions altered by 2 min of no chest compressions&#xD;
      (break), as recommended by the current ERC guidelines. The participants will perform the&#xD;
      described CPR sequence two times in a cross-over design with randomized order, once while&#xD;
      wearing PPE and once without wearing PPE. Between the two CPR sequences (i.e. with and&#xD;
      without PPE) a break of 60 min for recovery will be given. During both CPR sequences, the&#xD;
      quality of chest compressions will be measured.&#xD;
