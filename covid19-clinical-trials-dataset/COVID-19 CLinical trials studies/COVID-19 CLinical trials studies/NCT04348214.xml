  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective investigation and screening of all HCWs working in all governmental university&#xD;
      hospitals and the affiliated COVID-19 quarantine hospitals using an online survey and&#xD;
      laboratory testing using rapid serological tests and PCR. To date, the Ministry of Higher&#xD;
      Education has dedicated quarantine hospitals at the following governmental universities: Ain&#xD;
      Shams, Cairo, Helwan, Alexandria, Mansoura, Assiut, Minia. This list may be expanded in the&#xD;
      future. The project will be pilot tested in Ain Shams University, then extended to other&#xD;
      universities subsequently. For risk categorization of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 virus and&#xD;
      assessment of infection control needs, an online survey questionnaire will be administered to&#xD;
      all HCWs in the governmental university hospitals involved in emergency and intensive care&#xD;
      and in the provision of care for COVID-19 patients in the affiliated COVID-19 quarantine&#xD;
      hospitals. For confirmation of infection and determination of the secondary infection rate,&#xD;
      paired serological samples at baseline and after exposure will be collected. For measuring&#xD;
      the validity of the available rapid serological tests, a respiratory sample will be taken for&#xD;
      viral detection by RT-PCR. A real-time interactive map using geographical information system&#xD;
      programming will be developed to flag hotspots for HCWs' risk and infection control needs&#xD;
      that originated from the online survey risk categorization in governmental university and&#xD;
      COVID-19 quarantine hospitals. Policy and decision makers will use the map to manage&#xD;
      emergency healthcare resource mobilization based on HCWs' risk and infection control needs.&#xD;

      Research Approach and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Healthcare workers' risk and 2. Infection prevention and control needs: Study design and&#xD;
      setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fulfill specific objectives, a prospective investigation of all HCWs working in all&#xD;
      governmental university hospitals and the affiliated COVID-19 quarantine hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the Ministry of Higher Education has dedicated quarantine hospitals at the following&#xD;
      governmental universities: Ain Shams, Cairo, Helwan, Alexandria, Mansoura, Assiut, Minia.&#xD;
      This list may be expanded in the future. The project will be pilot tested in Ain Shams&#xD;
      University, then extended to other universities subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population For the purpose of this study, HCWs are defined as all staff in the&#xD;
      governmental university hospitals involved in emergency and intensive care and in the&#xD;
      provision of care for COVID-19 patients in the affiliated COVID-19 quarantine hospitals.&#xD;
      These include those who have been present in the same area as the patient, as well as those&#xD;
      who may not have provided direct care to the patient, but who have had contact with the&#xD;
      patient's body fluids, potentially contaminated items or environmental surfaces. This&#xD;
      includes health care professionals, allied health workers, auxiliary health workers (e.g.&#xD;
      cleaning and laundry personnel, x-ray physicians and technicians, clerks, phlebotomists,&#xD;
      respiratory therapist, nutritionists, social workers, physical therapists, lab personnel,&#xD;
      cleaners, admission/reception clerks, patient transporters, catering staff etc.). Once a case&#xD;
      of COVID-19 has been identified in these hospitals, a list of all health care workers with&#xD;
      any exposure to COVID-19 patient will need to be drawn up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study tool and data collection For risk categorization of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 virus and&#xD;
      assessment of infection control needs, an online survey questionnaire will be administered to&#xD;
      all HCWs in the governmental university hospitals involved in emergency and intensive care&#xD;
      and in the provision of care for COVID-19 patients in the affiliated COVID-19 quarantine&#xD;
      hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be adapted from the World Health Organization relevant protocols and&#xD;
      interim guidance. The sections of the questionnaire will cover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Socio-demographic, background information including history of tobacco use, and&#xD;
           pre-existing medical conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. COVID-19 virus exposure risk assessment for community exposure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. COVID-19 virus exposure risk assessment for nosocomial exposure (i.e. contact and&#xD;
           possible exposure with the COVID-19 patients since the patient has been admitted to the&#xD;
           health care facility);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HCW interactions with COVID-19 patient information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. HCW activities performed on COVID-19 patient in health care facility;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. HCW symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Adherence to infection prevention and control measures during health care interactions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Adherence to infection prevention and control measures when performing&#xD;
           aerosol-generating procedures (e.g. tracheal intubation, nebulizer treatment, open&#xD;
           airway suctioning, collection of sputum, tracheotomy, bronchoscopy, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
           resuscitation, etc.); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Accidents with biological material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This online survey will be completed at baseline and at any future contact or possible&#xD;
      exposure with the COVID-19 patients since the patient has been admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other forms will complement the data collected in the online survey questionnaire. The&#xD;
      complementary forms include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory form for specimen collection for screening and testing and the relevant&#xD;
           results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up laboratory form for specimen collection for screening and testing and the&#xD;
           relevant results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCW symptom diary: Each HCW contact will be asked to record the presence or absence of&#xD;
           various signs or symptoms each day for up to 21 days after the administration of the&#xD;
           baseline questionnaire (minimum 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome form for follow up of HCWs who experience contact or possible exposure with the&#xD;
           COVID-19 patients since the patient has been admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health care facility infection prevention and control form: filled once at baseline for&#xD;
           each of the study hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be filled by HCWs, and dedicated teams and coordinators representing the hospital&#xD;
      infection control focal points and the hospital management at each of the study hospitals.&#xD;
      The forms will be electronically linked to the online survey for instant updates of HCW&#xD;
      information using an automatically generated unique serial study number for each HCW to be&#xD;
      used across all study forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Testing for COVID-19 among healthcare workers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For confirmation of seroconversion, determination of the secondary-infection attack rate, and&#xD;
      the proportion of asymptomatic infection paired serological samples will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A baseline serum sample will be collected from all healthcare workers with any exposure&#xD;
           (regardless of symptoms), as soon as possible after confirmation of a COVED-19 infected&#xD;
           patient in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A second serum sample will be collected from the same healthcare workers at least 21&#xD;
           days after the collection of the first serum sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      For measuring the validity of the available rapid serological tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A respiratory sample will be taken for viral detection by RT-PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Geospatial mapping of health care workers' risk and infection control needs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this aim the following subtasks must be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Build a full stack web-based platform that is integrated with a geographical information&#xD;
      system. Where, the platform frontend is a real-time interactive map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the platform backend is a database system to store and manipulate the HCWs' risk&#xD;
      and infection control data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build a real-time Signal-R flagging service to track the survey results and put flags on&#xD;
           the platform interactive map where these flags represent the location of high HCWs' risk&#xD;
           and infection control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build a real-time reporting service based on Signal-R and Artificial Intelligence&#xD;
           techniques to follow up the survey results and inform the policy and the decision makers&#xD;
           with the location and information of the high HCWs' risk and infection control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this reporting service provides more insights on the survey results using the&#xD;
      Artificial Intelligence techniques such as the association between the geographical&#xD;
      information and the high HCWs' risk rate.&#xD;
