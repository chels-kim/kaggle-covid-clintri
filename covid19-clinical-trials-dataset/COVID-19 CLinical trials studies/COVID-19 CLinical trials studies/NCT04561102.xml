    <textblock>
      &quot;This is a prospective, single-center specimen collection study. Subjects 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 will be enrolled. Two nasal swab samples and one&#xD;
      saliva sample will be collected from each subject. The saliva sample will be tested with the&#xD;
      COVIDSeq Test and one nasal swab will be tested with an EUA approved COVID test. The other&#xD;
      nasal swab sample will be stored and a subset (approximately 250 specimens) will be tested&#xD;
      with the COVIDSeq Test. Results of all testing will be provided to the sponsor for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the comparator EUA test will be provided to the collection site investigator or&#xD;
      designated collection site study staff. No medical treatment, guidance on treatment&#xD;
      decisions, nor medical care will be provided. &quot;&#xD;
