  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has a big impact on individuals and society as a whole. Especially persons with&#xD;
      (multiple) comorbidities such as stroke are affected. The impact of COVID-19 on stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation delivery and stroke patients' functioning is unclear.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With 16'000 patients hospitalized and with new permanent disability in approximately 7'000&#xD;
      individuals every year in Switzerland, stroke has a major impact on quality of life and is an&#xD;
      enormous socioeconomic burden. Virtually all patients receive inpatient rehabilitation in the&#xD;
      sub-acute phase poststroke. However, also in the later phases poststroke, patients receive&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions in outpatient rehabilitation clinics and private practices, with&#xD;
      goal to improve or maintain their functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Switzerland finds itself in an extraordinary situation. The Federal Council has&#xD;
      issued a series of measures aimed at the population, organizations and institutions, and the&#xD;
      cantons. The aim is to curb the spread of the coronavirus and assure the provision of&#xD;
      healthcare. The people are invoked to stay at home and only leave the home if absolutely&#xD;
      necessary. If they are over the age of 65 or have an underlying medical condition, the&#xD;
      Federal Council strongly recommend that you stay at home under any circumstances unless you&#xD;
      have to go to the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the recommendation of the Swiss Federal Council almost all stroke patients belong to the&#xD;
      group who should stay home. Furthermore, all outpatient rehabilitation clinics have reduced&#xD;
      the interventions to a minimum. It is unknown how a sudden stop of rehabilitation influences&#xD;
      the stroke patients' functional capacities and their perceived quality of life.&#xD;
