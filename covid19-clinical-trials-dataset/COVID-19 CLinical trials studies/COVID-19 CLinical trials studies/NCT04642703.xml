  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in COVID-19 patients has been associated&#xD;
      with a high mortality rate. In this context, the utility of tracheostomy has been questioned&#xD;
      in this group of ill patients. This study aims to compare in-hospital mortality in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients with and without tracheostomy due to prolonged IMV Methods: Cohort study of adult&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients subjected to prolonged IMV. Since the first COVID-19 case (March 3, 2020)&#xD;
      up to November 30, 2020, all adult critical patients supported with IMV by 10 days or more at&#xD;
      the Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile will be included in the cohort. Pregnant women and&#xD;
      non-adult patients will be excluded. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory&#xD;
      data, disease severity, and ventilatory support will be retrospectively collected from&#xD;
      clinical records. The indication of tracheostomy, as part of our standard of care, will be&#xD;
      indicated by a team of specialists in intensive care medicine, following national guidelines,&#xD;
      and consented to by the patient's family. The 90-days mortality rate will be the primary&#xD;
      outcome, whereas IMV days, hospital/CU length of stay, and the frequency of&#xD;
      healthcare-associated infections will be the secondary outcomes. Also, a follow-up interview&#xD;
      will be performed one year after a hospital discharged in order to assess the vital status&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality of patients subjected to tracheostomy will be compared with the group of&#xD;
      patients without tracheostomy by logistic regression models. Furthermore, propensity-score&#xD;
      methods will be performed as a complementary analysis.&#xD;
