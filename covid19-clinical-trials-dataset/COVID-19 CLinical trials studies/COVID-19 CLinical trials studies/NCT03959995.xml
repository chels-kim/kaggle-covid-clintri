  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause usually have a serious impact on a woman's life, associated with negative&#xD;
      consequences for health and quality of life. Early preventive assessments are very difficult&#xD;
      to implement due to the complex hormone-deficiency-induced effects on a large variety of&#xD;
      organs and systems with estrogen receptors. In fact, only a few types of interventions have&#xD;
      the potential to comprehensively improve the various risk factors and complaints of the&#xD;
      menopausal transition. In detail, however, not every form of exercise training or every&#xD;
      training protocol is effective for exerting positive effects on selected risk factors. In&#xD;
      particular, the training concept for addressing musculoskeletal or cardio-metabolic risk&#xD;
      factors differ fundamentally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several studies, we confirmed the effect of different complex training programs on risk&#xD;
      factors of different postmenopausal female cohorts with special consideration of osteoporotic&#xD;
      aspects. The training programs applied in this context were characterized by the consistent&#xD;
      implementation of recognized training principles and an in general exercise&#xD;
      intensity-oriented approach. Recent studies confirmed the effectiveness of this proceeding&#xD;
      for women with relevant postmenopausal risk factors including low bone strength. However, the&#xD;
      crucial issue of the most effective, feasible and easily customizable training protocol for&#xD;
      addressing postmenopausal risk factors remains to be answered, taking into account that the&#xD;
      majority of exercise programs were realized in an ambulatory group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study will be to evaluate the effects of an optimized physical training on&#xD;
      risk factors and complaints of (early) postmenopausal women with special consideration of the&#xD;
      osseous fracture risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note (05.06.2020): Of importance, the intervention has to be cancelled due to COVID-19&#xD;
      lockdown in March 2020 after 13 months of intervention.&#xD;
