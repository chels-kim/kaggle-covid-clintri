    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Hexoskin cardiorespiratory and&#xD;
      activity data, as well as patient symptomatology, to provide an AI model for disease&#xD;
      progression that will be at the service of the clinical team to recommend the best customized&#xD;
      and evolving care trajectory for each patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The following protocol proposes a mixed methods pilot study, whereby the immediate purpose is&#xD;
      to generate quantifiable information regarding the feasibility of a virtual trial with the&#xD;
      Hexoskin Platform, collection of data quality in COVID-19 patients, and values for algorithm&#xD;
      construction. In essence, sixteen participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis will be&#xD;
      invited to wear the Hexoskin biometric garment during the course of several hours per week,&#xD;
      over a period of 28 days. In addition to the biometric data collection, participants will be&#xD;
      invited to complete four questionnaires. The biometric data will be combined to the&#xD;
      sociodemographic information and patient symptomatology to construct an algorithm which can&#xD;
      accurately predict patient outcomes.&#xD;
