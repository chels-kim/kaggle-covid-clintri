  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the Covid-19 pandemic, non-operative management for acute appendicitis (AA) was&#xD;
      implemented in the UK. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and outcomes of&#xD;
      conservative versus surgical management of AA during the pandemic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective observational cohort study was conducted in a single UK tertiary referral&#xD;
      centre and was registered locally as a clinical audit. Patients included in this study were&#xD;
      adults (≥16 years) with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis made clinically and/or&#xD;
      radiologically in our hospital. Patients presented sequentially to the emergency department,&#xD;
      and subsequently were referred to the emergency surgical service for further management. The&#xD;
      data collection periods were between 1st November 2019 and 10th March 2020 ('the pre-COVID&#xD;
      period') and 10th March 2020 to 5th July 2020 ('COVID period'). The start of the COVID period&#xD;
      was determined as the day of our hospital pandemic policy introduction, following the&#xD;
      identification of the first SARS-CoV-2 positive patient at our site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected retrospectively for the pre-COVID period and prospectively during the&#xD;
      COVID pandemic using the electronic patient record (HYPERSPACE® Epic 2014 Version IU1, Epic&#xD;
      Systems Corporation, Verona, WI, USA). Data collected included patient demographics,&#xD;
      radiology reports, timings of consultations, operative records, post-operative care,&#xD;
      post-operative complications, re-operation rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), histology&#xD;
      results, re-attendance to hospital and mortality within 90 days of the initial presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants were scored using the Alvarado score (9), Appendicitis inflammatory&#xD;
      response (AIR) score (10), the Adult appendicitis score (AAS) (11), American Society of&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (12) and Rockwood Clinical Frailty&#xD;
      Scale (13) based on their initial presentation history and investigations, as previously&#xD;
      described in the literature. Conservative management was determined as the use of antibiotics&#xD;
      only (i.e. an intervention was not offered at initial consultation). Interventional radiology&#xD;
      (IR) guided drain insertion refers to CT or ultrasound (US) guided insertion of an&#xD;
      intra-abdominal drain. Time to theatre was calculated in hours from the admission time to the&#xD;
      start of the operation. Operative time was calculated in minutes from skin incision to the&#xD;
      end of skin closure. Time of day when the procedure was performed was determined by the start&#xD;
      time of the operation, with those starting after 17:00 until the following day at 08:00&#xD;
      classified to have been performed out of hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative details were recorded based on the operating surgeon's documentation. Conversion&#xD;
      from a laparoscopic to open approach was determined as additional incisions performed either&#xD;
      in the right iliac fossa or midline laparotomy. The level of the surgeon was determined based&#xD;
      on the years of practice post-qualification (Junior Trainee; Senior Trainee; Consultant).&#xD;
      Critical care admission was determined if the patient was cared for in a Level 2 (high&#xD;
      dependency unit) or a Level 3 care (intensive care unit) setting. Re-attendance referred to&#xD;
      any patient re-presenting following their initial admission. This study has been reported in&#xD;
      line with the STROCSS criteria (14).&#xD;
