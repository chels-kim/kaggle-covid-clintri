  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initial data from COVID-19 patients suggests that one of the primary causes of death is&#xD;
      significant endothelial injury leading to blood clotting and impaired multiorgan&#xD;
      microvascular perfusion. The current study uses a safe, convenient bedside imaging tool&#xD;
      called contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to estimate the extent of microvascular perfusion&#xD;
      impairment in the heart, kidneys and/or brain of COVID-19 pediatric patients in vivo and&#xD;
      assess the significance of imaging findings by correlating to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted at one site, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. We&#xD;
      will enroll and evaluate 30 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current study uses a safe, convenient bedside imaging tool called contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) to measure the extent of microvascular perfusion impairment in the heart,&#xD;
      kidneys and/or brain of COVID-19 pediatric patients and, as exploratory analysis, to assess&#xD;
      the significance of imaging findings by correlating to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (LumasonTM, Bracco Inc) is an FDA-approved&#xD;
      ultrasound contrast agent. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan with a duration of approximately&#xD;
      15 minutes will be performed when a COVID-19 diagnosis has been made (or is highly suspected)&#xD;
      according to established clinical procedures. One CEUS will be performed per patient, with up&#xD;
      to 2 intravenous injections of the contrast agent. The dosing plan will be weight-adjusted,&#xD;
      based on a dose of 0.03 mL/kg (with a maximum dose of 2.4 mL per injection). Organ perfusion&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the heart, kidneys, and/or brain. Clinical outcomes during hospital stay&#xD;
      will be collected for correlation to CEUS-based measures.&#xD;

    <description>Intravenous administration of contrast agent Sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres before performing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). In pediatric patients, after reconstitution 0.03 mL per kg is administered intravenously. The weight-based dose of 0.03 mL per kg will be repeated one time during a single examination. Following each injection, an intravenous flush of 0.9% Sodium Chloride is injected. The study duration per subject will be approximately 15 minutes including the time to prepare the contrast agent and perform the CEUS, as well as the 60 minute monitoring period after the first and second injection (if there are two injections of contrast) of the contrast agent.</description>

    <description>Injection of Sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres (Lumason) contrast agent will be performed via the existing peripheral intravenous line using the FDA-recommended dose of 0.03 mg/kg. Two bolus injections will be performed to evaluate for dynamic bowel perfusion and several 2-minute cine clips as well as static images will be acquired during the exam.</description>
