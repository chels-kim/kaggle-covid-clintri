  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sustainability of the United Kingdom's National Health Service's (NHS) is threatened&#xD;
      immediately by Covid-19 and continually by an increasing prevalence of long-conditions that&#xD;
      cannot be cured but can be maintained. Shifting traditional face-to-face outpatient&#xD;
      appointments to remote video consultations may help the NHS continue to serve patients&#xD;
      efficiently. While much research has examined healthcare providers' attitudes and beliefs&#xD;
      about remote video consultations, less has attempted to understand how NHS service providers&#xD;
      should invite patients to attend them. The present study examines how the framing of an&#xD;
      invitation to attend a hospital outpatient appointment by video influences the proportion of&#xD;
      people who agree to attend by video. It also explores some of the barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      people may experience to attending appointments by video across diagnostic complexities and&#xD;
      age groups. The results of this study should help hospitals better present patients with the&#xD;
      option to attend video consultations where appropriate, and provide support to mitigate&#xD;
      common barriers to people's willingness to give video consultations a go.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Consenting participants be randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 fashion. Each group will be asked to imagine receiving an invitation to attend a hospital outpatient appointment by video or in-person. In the first group, the proposed attendance mode will be by video. In the second group, the proposed attendance mode will be in-person. In the third group, participants will simply be asked to select which mode of attendance they prefer: video or in-person.</intervention_model_description>
