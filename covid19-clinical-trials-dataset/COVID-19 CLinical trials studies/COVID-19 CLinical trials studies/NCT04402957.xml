      To evaluate the proportion of subjects alive and free of respiratory failure (e.g. need for&#xD;
      non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow oxygen, or ECMO) and free of the&#xD;
      need for continued renal replacement therapy (RRT) on Day 28. The need for continued RRT at&#xD;
      Day 28 will be defined as either dialysis in the past 3 days (Day 26, 27, or 28) or an eGFR&#xD;
      on Day 28 &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;

      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept&#xD;
      study of LSALT peptide as prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute&#xD;
      kidney injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Following screening and after&#xD;
      establishing baseline parameters such as lung and renal function, clinical chemistries,&#xD;
      coagulation, hematology, and urinalysis, and satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of two blinded treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 100 mL of 5 mg IV LSALT peptide infusion over 2 hours daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 100 mL drug-free IV saline infusion over 2 hours daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty (30) patients will be randomized to active drug (LSALT peptide) and 30 patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to matching placebo. Patients and, if necessary, the Legal Authorized&#xD;
      Representative (LAR), the Investigational Staff, and the Sponsor and its representatives will&#xD;
      not know the randomization schemata. The Pharmacist at the site will be unblinded and prepare&#xD;
      drug/placebo for injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      LSALT peptide compared with placebo in a defined number of adult hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      the diagnosis of COVID-19. This is a 1:1 randomization comparing 5 mg LSALT peptide daily&#xD;
      with matching placebo. LSALT peptide or drug-free saline will begin immediately once the&#xD;
      patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria at the start of hospitalization and followed&#xD;
      with daily physical exams, blood chemistries, coagulation, and hematology; ECGs will be&#xD;
      recorded at Baseline, Day 3, and EOS. Patients will be maintained on standard of care,&#xD;
      including prophylaxis or treatment for VTE, per institutional guidelines throughout the&#xD;
      study. Questionnaires (APACHE II, SOFA, Berlin Definition, and modified Medical Research&#xD;
      Council Dyspnea Scale) will be assessed at Baseline, when clinically indicated, and at EOT&#xD;
      and EOS. Dosing will end on Day 14, or at cure or increasing severity of ARDS, or at death.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed clinically, and safety and efficacy measures will be recorded at&#xD;
      end of study (EOS; Day 28) or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of therapy will be a maximum of 14 days. Patients will be maintained on the standard&#xD;
      of care for the treatment of COVID-19 as defined by the institutional guidelines.&#xD;
      Co-morbidities and concomitant medications will be reviewed daily and documented in the&#xD;
      patient's eCRF. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential consequence of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, will be assessed daily and prophylaxis will be included as standard of&#xD;
      care for every patient. Please refer to antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      (COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, 12-May-2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (refer to the DSMB Charter) will evaluate patients on a&#xD;
      continuing basis for primarily safety assessments but also the adequacy of treatment based&#xD;
      upon clinical data of the patient, target drug concentrations, and data obtained from the&#xD;
      AB001 PK study in healthy subjects to offer recommendations to the Sponsor. In the absence of&#xD;
      adverse events or any safety issues during the course of study, the DSMB may recommend&#xD;
      continuance or suspension of the study due to futility or safety issues. The DSMB will meet&#xD;
      at least monthly if not more frequently based upon enrollment throughout the study period.&#xD;
      Per protocol, at no time will patients be dosed for more than 14 days of therapy. The DSMB&#xD;
      Charter will outline all processes for changes to the protocol and protocol design prior to&#xD;
      the first patient being enrolled into study.&#xD;

    <description>LSALT, a peptide drug with the sequence NH3-LSALTPSPSWLKYKAL-COOH, binds to dipeptidase-1 (DPEP-1) but does not inhibit its biologic enzymatic activity, potentially minimizing off-target or other adverse effects. LSALT peptide inhibits leukocyte recruitment in multiple experimental disease models through the direct inhibition of leukocyte adhesion to DPEP-1 present in lungs, kidney, and liver. DPEP-1 represents a new molecular pathway for leukocyte adhesion discovered by Arch Biopartners scientists.</description>

          4. APACHE II score &lt; 20&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Therapies which have been shown to be beneficial and are included in standard COVID-19&#xD;
             treatment guidelines (e.g. those of WHO or NIH) are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Sexually active women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must be using a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control throughout the study and for at least 1 day&#xD;

             A medically acceptable method of birth control includes intrauterine devices in place&#xD;
             for at least 3 months, surgical sterilization, or the implant. In patients who are not&#xD;
             sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control and urine will be&#xD;
             tested per protocol. Women who are of nonchild-bearing potential, i.e.,&#xD;
             post-menopause, must have this condition captured in their medical history. Pregnant&#xD;
             women and nursing mothers are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient or LAR is available and willing to give written informed consent, after being&#xD;
             properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and prior to engaging in any&#xD;
             study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             within five half-lives or 30 days (whichever is longer) prior to randomization and&#xD;
             throughout the study period. However, should any of these treatments become&#xD;
             standard-of-care and incorporated into clinical treatment guidelines (e.g. those of&#xD;
             WHO or NIH), the treatment is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Anticipated transfer to another hospital or medical center within 72 hours, which is&#xD;
             not a study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled of poorly treated active hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HepC), or HIV&#xD;

               -  Chronic hematologic disease which, in the opinion of the PI, prohibits the&#xD;
                  patient from entering into study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute liver injury with AST and/or ALT levels greater than 3x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of coagulopathy within the last year as defined by abnormal ACT, aPTT,&#xD;
