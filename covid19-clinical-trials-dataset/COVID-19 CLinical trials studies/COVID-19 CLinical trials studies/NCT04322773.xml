  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. The median time from onset of symptoms of COVID-19 to development of acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported as short as 9 days. No effective&#xD;
      prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. According to data from the&#xD;
      Danish Health Authority (www.sst.dk/corona), as of March 21st, 2020, there were 1326 patients&#xD;
      infected with the disease in Denmark, more than 250 are admitted to a hospital, and &gt;50 of&#xD;
      them have required intensive care. Nearly 350.000 cases and 15.000 deaths have been reported&#xD;
      globally. These numbers are likely to markedly increase during the coming weeks, challenging&#xD;
      the capacity of health systems worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it has been described that disease severity and&#xD;
      outcomes are related to the characteristics of the immune response. Interleukin (IL)-6 and&#xD;
      other components of the inflammatory cascade contribute to host defense against infections.&#xD;
      However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response known as 'cytokine storm'. In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study&#xD;
      found that a cytokine storm involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Studies on the Middle&#xD;
      East respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate that cytokine&#xD;
      genes of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 can be markedly upregulated. Similarly, patients with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines&#xD;
      including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),&#xD;
      interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage&#xD;
      inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and TNF-α. These findings indicate that the magnitude&#xD;
      and characteristics of the cytokine response is related to the severity and prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that IL-6 blockade may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for&#xD;
      other types of cytokine storm, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including&#xD;
      sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Remarkable&#xD;
      beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a IL-6 receptor inhibitor has been&#xD;
      described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a retrospective case series from&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two available drugs based on human monoclonal antibodies against IL-6&#xD;
      receptor, tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) and sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi). IL-6 receptor&#xD;
      inhibitors are currently licensed for several autoimmune disorders and are considered well&#xD;
      tolerated and safe in general. The most common side effects reported are upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections, headache, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious&#xD;
      side effects are serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm associated with&#xD;
      serious adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and that blockade of&#xD;
      IL-6 would be suitable therapeutic target for these patients. The study will investigate the&#xD;
      effect of different types of IL-6 inhibition versus no adjuvant treatment compared to&#xD;
      standard of care in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the effect of either one of three IL-6 inhibitor&#xD;
      administrations, relative to the standard of care, on time to independence from supplementary&#xD;
      oxygen therapy, measured in days from baseline to day 28, in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
