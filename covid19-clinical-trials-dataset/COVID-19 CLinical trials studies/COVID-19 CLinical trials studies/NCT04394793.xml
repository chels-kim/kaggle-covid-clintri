    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy in low doses (30 to 100 cGy) was a popular treatment of viral pneumonias until&#xD;
      1940s. Low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) could possibly reduce the inflammation and prevent&#xD;
      the cytokine storm thus mitigating the severity of pneumonitis. This is a single arm study&#xD;
      designed to assess the feasibility and clinical efficacy of low dose radiation therapy (70&#xD;
      cGy in single fraction) in the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A total of 10 eligible&#xD;
      patients (as per inclusion criteria) will be recruited and response will be assessed based on&#xD;
      the symptomatic improvement or deterioration by using the National Early Warning Score&#xD;
      (NEWS). The NEWS score will be recorded on baseline and then on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14.&#xD;

      There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, and no vaccine is&#xD;
      currently available. The treatment is symptomatic, and oxygen therapy represents the major&#xD;
      treatment intervention for patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be&#xD;
      necessary in cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen therapy, whereas hemodynamic&#xD;
      support is essential for managing septic shock. The death rate ranges from 2-15% in different&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in modern history of humankind and it has become&#xD;
      imperative to find novel treatments to mitigate the casualties caused by infection. The&#xD;
      clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from mild symptoms to critical conditions requiring&#xD;
      ventilatory support and ICU care. According to Chinese CDC report, 81% patients had mild&#xD;
      disease (non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia), 14% had severe disease and 5% had critical&#xD;
      disease. Based on severity of symptoms, there are several scoring methods which can predict&#xD;
      the outcome of disease. National early warning score (NEWS) is a popular scoring system used&#xD;
      for non-ICU patients suffering from acute illness. This score helps in quickly determining&#xD;
      the degree of illness and intervention required. It also provides likelihood of death or&#xD;
      admission to an ICU. Based on this score any illness can be categorized as mild (Score &lt;4),&#xD;
      moderate (Score 5-6 or individual 3) and severe (Score ≥7). According to this scoring system,&#xD;
      Covid-19 patients having a score of 5-6 will have probability of 15.7% critical events&#xD;
      (HDU/ICU admission or 30-day mortality) and those having score ≥7 will have about 24.1%&#xD;
      critical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonitis appears to involve a cytokine storm with elevated&#xD;
      pro- inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα among many others, leading to an onslaught&#xD;
      of neutrophils and macrophages, diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure. This is&#xD;
      where a potential opportunity for low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) emerges. LDRT is a&#xD;
      potential treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia since it has an anti-inflammatory action.&#xD;
      Successful management of worsening pneumonia will reduce the development of ARDS and thereby&#xD;
      preventing deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of megavoltage beam in modern times has improved our dosimetry in treating deep&#xD;
      targets. Radiotherapy which can penetrate lobar and interstitial space can help in preventing&#xD;
      both lobar as well as interstitial pneumonia. In the absence of any effective drug and,&#xD;
      historical data suggests that low dose of 0.5 to 1 Gy radiotherapy to whole lung can possibly&#xD;
      prevent cytokine storm and critical events (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial use of X-rays to treat patients with pneumonia was reported in 1907. This report&#xD;
      offered a new mechanistic insight founded on the dose response, proposing that low doses of&#xD;
      X-rays would affect disease resolution. It was observed that not only did the X-ray treatment&#xD;
      has lifesaving potential, but it was also effective when other treatments had reached their&#xD;
      therapeutic limits as seen in cases of chronic bronchopneumonia, which could be resolved with&#xD;
      a single administration of X-rays. Subsequent reports suggested that LDRT was successful in&#xD;
      decreasing the mortality rate in untreated patients from about 30% to 5-10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Study: It is reasonable to try an LDRT treatment of 30 to 100 cGy to the&#xD;
      lungs of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia as it could reduce the inflammation and relieve&#xD;
      the life-threatening symptoms. The recent emerging literature indicates that the efficacy of&#xD;
      thoracic LDRT must be investigated as it would present a negligible risk to COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia patients, and have the potential to reduce the fatality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Interventional, Clinical, Single arm, Pilot study Number of patients: 10&#xD;
      Treatment: Patient will be treated as per COVID-19 standard management protocol of the&#xD;
      treating institute along with intervention of Low Dose Radiotherapy (LDRT) 70cGy in single&#xD;
      fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment field- Field adequately covering both the lungs. Beam energy : 6MV X-ray photons&#xD;
      Number of beams- 2 (1 Anterior and 1 posterior field). Prescription point - Midway of&#xD;
      anterior-posterior chest separation. Treatment Workflow: Patients will be maneuvered to lie&#xD;
      down on treatment couch in a supine position, with hands above head. Gantry rotated to 90&#xD;
      degree, a lateral chest X ray portal image will be taken, which will guide in measuring dose&#xD;
      prescription point. Gantry rotated back to 0 degree; an adequate field size will be opened.&#xD;
      Total treatment duration will be about 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response Assessment and statistical analysis: Response will be assessed based on the&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement or deterioration by using the NEWS score. The NEWS score will be&#xD;
      recorded on baseline and then on Day 3 (D-3), Day 7 (D-7) and Day 14 (D-14). To compare the&#xD;
      NEWS score (baseline and post LDRT), student t test (paired) will be used. For statistical&#xD;
      significance, p value of 0.1 will be considered significant. Number of patients requiring ICU&#xD;
      admission or undergoing death following LDRT will also be recorded to assess critical events.&#xD;
