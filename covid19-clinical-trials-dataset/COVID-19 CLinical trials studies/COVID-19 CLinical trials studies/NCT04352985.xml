      Prospective, observational, clinical investigation of PMX cartridge use in COVID 19 patients&#xD;
      with septic shock&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use protocol for a population of patients with an immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening condition, for whom no comparable alternative therapy options are available.&#xD;
      The PMX cartridge will be utilized to treat critically ill patients with septic shock who&#xD;
      also have COVID 19 virus. The objective will be to observe the efficacy of the PMX cartridge&#xD;
      with a focus on safety of use in this population.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Toraymyxin PMX-20R (PMX Cartridge)</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention is two (2) treatment sessions of PMX cartridge administration within approximately 24 hours of each other. Each treatment session will target 2 hours with a minimum of 1 ½ hours, at a flow rate of approximately 100 mL/minute, (range of 80 to 120 mL/minute). In cases where the clinical status of the subject is improving, or if the subject suffers from a relapse and the treating physician believes an additional PMX treatment may improve the clinical outcome of the subject, they may administer an additional PMX treatment session (for a total of 3 treatment sessions) at their discretion. All subjects will continue to receive standard medical care for COVID 19 and septic shock.</description>
