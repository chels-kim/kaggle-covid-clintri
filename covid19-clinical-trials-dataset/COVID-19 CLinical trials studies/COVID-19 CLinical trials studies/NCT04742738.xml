    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded,&#xD;
      age-escalating study to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a SK&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccine (GBP510) adjuvanted with Alum in healthy&#xD;
      younger and older adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      candidate vaccine administered twice with 28-day interval in healthy adults including older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 260 healthy younger and older adults will be enrolled to receive 2 doses of either&#xD;
      one GBP510 formulation (Test group 1 or 2) or placebo saline (Placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 2 stages, and a stepwise approach will be adopted as a safety&#xD;
      precaution. Approximately 60 healthy adults aged 19 to 55 years will be enrolled and&#xD;
      vaccinated first in Stage 1, and blinded safety data collected through 14 days after the last&#xD;
      study vaccination will be reviewed by the sponsor, and then by the independent Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) in an unblinded manner. Advancement to Stage 2 for further enrollment&#xD;
      of 200 healthy younger and older adults aged 19 to 85 years will be determined if an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile is confirmed based on the sponsor and DSMB review. DSMB will&#xD;
      recommend whether to proceed to the next stage or not, and DSMB may suggest discontinuation&#xD;
      of the study or adjustment of dose and dosing regimen based on the safety review.&#xD;
