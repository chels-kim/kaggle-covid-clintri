    <textblock>
      DPPFit is a Healthy Lifestyle Intervention designed to reformat the effective strategies of&#xD;
      the Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) into a tool for use in a primary care setting. DPPFit&#xD;
      is a 16-week technology-based intervention for diabetes prevention. In keeping with the&#xD;
      National DPP educational sessions, the intervention weeks follow the order and presentation&#xD;
      of the N-DPP 16 session topics. The goal is to develop a pragmatic translation of the DPP&#xD;
      that is effective in the real-world setting of primary care clinic. The hope is that in doing&#xD;
      so, those at risk of developing type II diabetes mellitus will have evidenced-based&#xD;
      prevention methods at their disposal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      DPPFit is an HLI designed to translate the effective strategies of the National Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (N-DPP) into a tool for use in a primary care setting. The 16-week&#xD;
      intervention follows the order of the 16 sessions that make up the core components of the&#xD;
      traditional DPP. The novelty in this application is the intervention delivery, in addition to&#xD;
      the use of technology to supplement resource and time intensive DPP behavioral strategies.&#xD;
      The entire intervention is delivered through automated text messages (SMS/MMS). For any given&#xD;
      week, the daily text messages for that week reflect the core session of the DPP (i.e DPPFit&#xD;
      Week 1 texts correspond to DPP Session 1). In addition to the automated daily messages,&#xD;
      participants are issued a Fitbit and assisted in setting up the Fitbit App on their smart&#xD;
      phones. The Fitbit App is considered a standalone mHealth App. The fitness tracker and&#xD;
      companion App allow participants to set goals and track food and physical activity. The&#xD;
      content of the text messaging is almost entirely from the N-DPP participant notebook (2012).&#xD;
      Exceptions to this are a series of prompts to cue participant to use the Fitbit and/or Fitbit&#xD;
      App to support the session. These include topics about setting goals in the Fitbit App, how&#xD;
      to track food using the App, or how to connect with friends and do challenges on Fitbit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be sustainable and feasible in a primary care setting, remote delivery of intervention&#xD;
      materials and components is a necessary part of any evidence-based tool to address diabetes&#xD;
      prevention. This automated, remote dissemination, technology-based application of the N-DPP&#xD;
      components means that intervention delivery and protocol are feasible methods to address&#xD;
      diabetes prevention in light of the ongoing Covid-19 health crisis.&#xD;

    <description>The Enhanced Intervention Group was a subgroup of the participants that were invited for voluntary weekly meet-n-greet sessions in the Primary Care Clinic. These sessions were information and not educational sessions for the intervention. The entire EIG concept was to test a social component of participants by providing an informal opportunity for a DPPFit social group. The group sessions were terminated after only 5 weeks as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were the only component of the DPPFit study that were face-to-face.</description>
