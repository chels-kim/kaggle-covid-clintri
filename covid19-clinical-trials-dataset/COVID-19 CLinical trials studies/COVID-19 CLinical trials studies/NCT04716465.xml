    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a serious global public health concern. This disease is&#xD;
      caused by a novel coronavirus which was first discovered in Wuhan, China in 2019 and later&#xD;
      spread rapidly throughout the world. Symptoms of the disease can manifest as fever, cough,&#xD;
      encephalitis, myalgia, fatigue, muscle weakness, arthralgia, anosmia, and impairment in other&#xD;
      bodily functions in the acute phase. In 17% to 67% of cases, COVID-19 patients will develop&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and critical illness. Besides the impact on the&#xD;
      respiratory system, coronaviruses have an effect on other systems including the central&#xD;
      nervous system, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, and gastrointestinal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential long-term secondary effects on the musculoskeletal system such as muscle weakness,&#xD;
      decreased muscle mass, and myopathies have been brought under attention. Persisting symptoms&#xD;
      in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection are frequently a complaint with at least 1&#xD;
      symptom, particularly fatigue and dyspnea. In recent papers, the authors commented on the&#xD;
      potential role of dysautonomia in the post-covid-19 entity related to microangiopathy and&#xD;
      endothelial injury. Such lesions were already reported in brain biopsy samples of severe&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is further to elucidate the presence of dysautonomia in&#xD;
      post-covid-19 patients, by evaluating heart rate variability.&#xD;
