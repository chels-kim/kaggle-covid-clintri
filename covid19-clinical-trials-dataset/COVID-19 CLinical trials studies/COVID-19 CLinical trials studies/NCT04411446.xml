  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent inception of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the coronavirus disease&#xD;
      (COVID-19), has caused thousands of deaths globally. The most frequently reported&#xD;
      complications among COVID-19 patients are from respiratory involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D has immunomodulatory effects that could protect against COVID-19 infection. Indeed,&#xD;
      there is good evidence from randomized clinical trials suggesting that high doses of vitamin&#xD;
      D administered during cold seasons prevent viral respiratory infections in at risk&#xD;
      individual, and more recently, observational studies suggested that the mortality rate from&#xD;
      COVID-19 is inversely correlated with levels of serum 25(OH)vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that a high dose of vitamin D given orally to patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 will prevent the occurrence of respiratory deragement&#xD;
      and other adverse clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the aforementioned hypothesis, a randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical&#xD;
      trial comparing a 500.000 UI dose of vitamin D versus placebo among COVID-19 patients at&#xD;
      moderate risk, requiring hospitalization but without requirements of critical care at&#xD;
      admission was designed. The intervention will be one dose of 500.000 UI given orally or&#xD;
      matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has a sequential design with two steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first step, projected to include 200 patients, will assess the effects of the&#xD;
           intervention on the respiratory SOFA; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is a detectable effects, the second step, projected to include 1264 patients,&#xD;
           will assess the effects on a combined event that includes need of high dose of oxygen or&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study outcomes will be measured during the index hospitalization.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two parallel arms randomized controlled trial. A sequential design will be used with the first primary outcome being the primary outcome for the first step. This step will include 200 patients. After reach this point, a review of the primary outcome (change in respiratory SOFA) will be done. According to these results, the Executive committee will decide to proceed the second step of the study and include the remaining 1064 patients to evaluate the second primary outcome (need for high dose of oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory SOFA.</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>Is the respiratory component of the sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score). It is a 4 points scale, each point indicate a deeper respiratory impairment. The score is based on the relationship between the arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2), as the ratio of both (PaFi). In the cases were arterial blood gas are not measured, the pulse oximetry will be used instead.&#xD;
The respiratory SOFA is as follows:&#xD;
1: PaO2/FiO2 &gt;=300;&#xD;
2: PaO2/FiO2 &gt;=200 and &lt;300;&#xD;
3: PaO2/FiO2 &gt;=100 and &lt;200;&#xD;
4: PaO2/FiO2 &lt;100.&#xD;
The minimum respiratory SOFA score will be record on daily basis during first week or to death or discharge, whichever occur first.&#xD;
