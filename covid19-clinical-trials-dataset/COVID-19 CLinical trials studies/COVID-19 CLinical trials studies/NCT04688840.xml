    <textblock>
      Introduction: Over the last decades, telemedicine has been used in many surgical aspects. Its&#xD;
      role in postoperative follow up is of significant interest with a remarkable success. Since&#xD;
      the appearance of COVID-19, the challenge is how to follow the recommendations of World&#xD;
      Health Organization which stressed on the importance of social distancing to avoid infection&#xD;
      and at the same time provides satisfactory medical services. This study was done to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and efficacy of Whatsapp social media program in postoperative follow up of&#xD;
      patients with primary hip arthroplasty at the time of pandemic&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized comparative study. The investigators reviewed all registered&#xD;
      patients underwent primary total hip arthroplasty (T.H.A.) at our department up to five years&#xD;
      ago. Four hundred sixty three patients were recorded at our data base. After reviewing&#xD;
      patients' files, the investigators excluded fifty two patients with follow up less than one&#xD;
      year and 29 patients with a previous history of complications. Three hundred eighty two&#xD;
      patients were initially eligible for the study. The investigators contacted them by telephone&#xD;
      calls in order to ask them to be included in this study. The investigators were unable to&#xD;
      contact 57 patients, 51 refused to be included, 31 preferred a personal contact with the&#xD;
      surgeon, 14 patients were died and 51 patients did not have an internet access. One hundred&#xD;
      seventy eight participants were finally eligible to be included in our research. Only 167&#xD;
      participants completed both electronic and routine follow up and these were our final&#xD;
      materials. The investigators designed a group on WhatsApp for all participants included in&#xD;
      the study. The questionnaires were sent on the group to be filled by the participants in&#xD;
      addition to a request for routine x ray follow up. Also, the investigators used the group to&#xD;
      send any announcement, schedule of routine visits and some instructions about how to answer&#xD;
      the questionnaires. To keep the privacy of participants' information, every one was asked to&#xD;
      resend the file and x- ray pictures to the surgeon private account. The investigators&#xD;
      collected data received by all participants and reviewed them. If there was any serious&#xD;
      complain or major radiological finding the investigators asked the participant for immediate&#xD;
      clinical visit. One month later, the investigators started to recall all participants for&#xD;
      routine follow up visit (RV) and reevaluate them clinically and radiologically. The&#xD;
      investigators asked participants to calculate total time needed for completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaires, time needed for x-ray and we added time needed for reviewing these files. The&#xD;
      same was done at the RV including time of transportation. The investigators obtained a&#xD;
      written consent from all of the participants after discussion about the aim of the research&#xD;
      and the confidentiality of their data. All procedures performed in the study were in&#xD;
      accordance with the ethical standards of our department and with the 1964 Helsinki&#xD;
      declaration and its later amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators evaluated the effectiveness of the electronic visit (EV) by calculation of&#xD;
      the number of missing complications or signs detected at the time of RV and require any&#xD;
      interference or close observation&#xD;
