      The study is a multicenter, adaptive, randomized, double-blinded, and placebocontrolled Phase&#xD;
      II/III trial. It will be conducted globally. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of SCTA01 in high-risk outpatients with COVID-19.The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy rate among study group [SCTA01+ standard of care (SOC)] and&#xD;
      control group (placebo + SOC) up to Day 29.&#xD;
