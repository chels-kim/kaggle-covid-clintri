      A multi-centre, observational cohort study will be carried out in consecutive patients&#xD;
      operated on for urgent digestive pathology. Two cohorts will be defined: the 'pandemic'&#xD;
      cohort, which will include all patients [COVID-19-positive or negative] operated on for&#xD;
      emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2020; and the control&#xD;
      cohort, which will include all patients operated on for emergency digestive pathology during&#xD;
      the months of March to June 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be gathered on demographic characteristics, clinical and analytical&#xD;
      parameters, scores on the usual risk scales for quality management in a General Surgery&#xD;
      service (POSSUM, P-POSSUM and LUCENTUM scores), prognostic factors applicable to all&#xD;
      patients, specific factors for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, complications and&#xD;
      postoperative mortality (at 30 and 90 postoperative days). In the pandemic cohort it will be&#xD;
      detailed whether or not the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective will be to determine the incidence of postoperative complications and&#xD;
      mortality. This variable will be analysed in the &quot;full analysis set&quot; population. Secondary&#xD;
      objective will be to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infected patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COVIDCIR is an observational, multicenter, cohorts' study of patients undergoing&#xD;
      emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery during the period of maximum impact of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in Spain (from March 1st to June 30th, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study conforms to the stipulations of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Ethics and Clinical Investigation&#xD;
      Committee) and a waiver for written informed consent was given. The level of protection of&#xD;
      confidentiality, in terms of protection of personal data as required by Spanish Law (LOPD&#xD;
      3/2018), was also ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 surgical teams from different Spanish hospitals have been proposed as&#xD;
      participants in this study, which has been coordinated by the Department of General and&#xD;
      Digestive Surgery of Bellvitge University Hospital (L'Hospitalet del Llobregat, Barcelona,&#xD;
      Spain). All hospitals participating are from Spain, with different surgical capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients operated on for emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery constitute the target&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: ≥18 years, both genders, and operated on for urgent/emergency&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patients who have undergone a scheduled surgical intervention or patients&#xD;
      operated on by a service other than General and Digestive Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts will be defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Covid-19-positive (infected by SARS-CoV-2) patients who required emergency/urgent&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery from March 1st to June 30th, 2020 Cohort 2: Covid-19-negative (not&#xD;
      infected by SARS-CoV-2)patients who required emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery from&#xD;
      March 1st to June 30th, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Consecutive patients who required emergency/urgent gastrointestinal surgery from&#xD;
      March 1st to June 30th, 2019 (control cohort of a &quot;pre-pandemic&quot; period, all patients&#xD;
      Covid-19-negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is 30-day postoperative mortality. Secondary variables are 90-day mortality,&#xD;
      postoperative complications, severa complications (graded as Clavien-Dindo score &gt;= IIIA),&#xD;
      and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main variables related to postoperative mortality and complications will be: Age,&#xD;
      comorbidities, ASA score, type of surgical pathology, type of performed surgery, POSSUM&#xD;
      score, P-POSSUM score, LUCENTUM score and specific analitic parameters for Covid-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics, and a&#xD;
      descriptive and exploratory comparative analysis between cohorts will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative incidence of mortality (and its 95% confident interval) and the incidence of&#xD;
      morbidity (and its 95% confident interval) at 30 and 90 days will be estimated by SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection status (cohort 1) and in the control groups (cohorts 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the selection bias effect of potential confounders, propensity scores will be&#xD;
      estimated using a multinomial model to estimate the probability that subjects were&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-positive, SARS-CoV-2-negative. Then, subjects will be matched using the propensity&#xD;
      score. After matching, to identify imbalance between groups, the standardized mean difference&#xD;
      will be estimated and plotted. In the matched sample, the cumulative incidence of mortality&#xD;
      (and its 95% confidence interval) and the incidence of morbidity (and its 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval) at 30 and 90 days will be compared using a generalized linear model with a binomial&#xD;
      distribution and a logarithm link function. Those variables that remain imbalance between&#xD;
      groups after matching would be added to the model with an adjusting purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and a logarithm link function will be&#xD;
      used to estimate relative risk as a measure to indentify prognostic factors associated with&#xD;
      30 and 90 days mortality and morbidity incidences. Five predictive scores of postoperative&#xD;
      complications and/or mortality will be calculated: POSSUM-mortality, POSSUM-complications,&#xD;
      P-POSSUM, LUCENTUM-logistic regression and LUCENTUM-CHAID. Their applicability on the&#xD;
      complications and/or mortality prediction in COVID-19 pandemic will be assessed.&#xD;
