  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to discuss the neuroimaging findings and indications, epidemiological data,&#xD;
      laboratory values, and the relationship of these variables with mortality in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 can present as neurological symptoms such as anosmia, headache, taste perversion,&#xD;
      dizziness, syncope, and altered state of consciousness. It has been reported in previous&#xD;
      studies that thromboembolic ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes associated with COVID-19 have&#xD;
      been observed in the early period. It has been suggested that conditions characterized by&#xD;
      neurological sequelae, such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, ataxic seizures,&#xD;
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), demyelinating diseases, and neuromuscular disorders may occur&#xD;
      in the longer term.In the present study, the investigators aimed to reveal the findings of&#xD;
      neuroimaging analyses performed in patients followed up with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who had&#xD;
      neurological symptoms, discuss the relationship of these findings with laboratory and&#xD;
      epidemiological data, and emphasize that CNS involvement in these patients should not be&#xD;
      overlooked. In this study, 436 patients with COVID-19 who underwent at least one neuroimaging&#xD;
      procedure during April 2020-December 2020 due to neurological symptoms and whose diagnosis&#xD;
      was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test were included. Although&#xD;
      computed tomography was predominantly used for imaging, magnetic resonance imaging was also&#xD;
      used when necessary. The patients were grouped based on imaging findings, and statistical&#xD;
      evaluations were made between the groups.&#xD;
