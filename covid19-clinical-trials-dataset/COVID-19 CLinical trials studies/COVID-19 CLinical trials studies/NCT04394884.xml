      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome. It is caused by the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. People with severe COVID-19 infection have a hyper-inflammatory response.&#xD;
      Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a role in the innate immune system. BTK inhibition can be&#xD;
      used to target the innate immune system that appears to contribute to mortality. This could&#xD;
      be an effective way to help the inflammatory responses in people with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the immunologic mechanisms by which BTK inhibition may decrease&#xD;
      hyper-inflammatory responses in people with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older in one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are in the hospital with COVID-19. They will or will not be treated with a BTK&#xD;
           inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They do not have COVID-19. They are or are not in the hospital. They will be treated&#xD;
           with a BTK inhibitor for a reason other than COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their demographic and clinical information.&#xD;
      Their medical history will be reviewed. If they have COVID-19, their symptoms will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give 3-4 blood samples. These may be taken through a vein. They may also be&#xD;
      taken through an existing central venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give a stool sample. This will be collected by nursing staff. It will be&#xD;
      collected using a stool collection vial. Stool collection is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants samples will be collected over about 7 days. These will be used for research and&#xD;
      genetic testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel&#xD;
      coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe COVID-19&#xD;
      infection is associated with a hyper-inflammatory response and evidence of innate immune cell&#xD;
      activation. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a central role in innate immune cell signaling&#xD;
      and activation and BTK inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for&#xD;
      ameliorating excessive inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which BTK inhibition modulates the host inflammatory response in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 is critical in order to better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multisite natural history laboratory study, hospitalized patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      (n=80) will be recruited at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and The Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Hospital. Forty of these patients will be recipients of BTK inhibition, either as&#xD;
      part of their standard clinical care or in another clinical trial. The other 40 will not be&#xD;
      recipients of BTK inhibition and will serve as a control group. A third group of patients&#xD;
      without COVID-19 (n=40) who will be recipients of BTK inhibition for other clinical&#xD;
      indications will also be enrolled as a second control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three or four longitudinal blood draws and may be asked to provide&#xD;
      stool samples. All specimens and data will be coded and sent to the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health (NIH) for research analysis. Only site investigators will have access to the code s&#xD;
      key for their respective sites; the NIH investigators will not have the keys. Coded blood&#xD;
      samples will be used for genetic testing, transcriptional analyses, deep immunological&#xD;
      phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other research tests. Coded clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data from routine care (e.g., basic demographic information, vital signs,&#xD;
      medications, clinical labs, and radiologic imaging findings) will also be captured. Coded&#xD;
      stool samples may be collected as part of this study to determine whether viable SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      is present in stool, which will help advance our understanding of pathogenesis and enteric&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
