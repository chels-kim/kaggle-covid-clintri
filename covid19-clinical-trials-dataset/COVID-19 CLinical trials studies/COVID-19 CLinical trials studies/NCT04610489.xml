    <textblock>
      This study plans to compare a direct antigen test for severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) obtained by mid-turbinate nasal swab with a reverse transcription&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) test obtained by nasopharyngeal swab (the current&#xD;
      reference standard) in a population of patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 for&#xD;
      fewer than 5 days. Subjects whose physicians have already ordered an rt-PCR test at a&#xD;
      Carilion testing center will be screened and recruited by phone during a required scheduling&#xD;
      call. The study coordinator will describe the study by phone, and the subject will be&#xD;
      consented when they arrive at the testing center. After consenting, a mid-turbinate swab&#xD;
      direct antigen test will be obtained just prior to the ordered nasopharyngeal swab and any&#xD;
      other ordered tests. The subjects will receive their rt-PCR test results through the usual&#xD;
      channels of clinical notification. The subjects will not receive their nasal antigen results.&#xD;
      The antigen test results will be analyzed in a batch process and the results entered into&#xD;
      RedCap by the study staff. The rt-PCR results will be extracted from the Epic electronic&#xD;
      health record using patient identifiers and paired with the corresponding antigen result for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
