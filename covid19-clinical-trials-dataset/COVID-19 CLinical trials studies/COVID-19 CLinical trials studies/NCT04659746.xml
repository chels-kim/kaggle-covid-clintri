    <textblock>
      MejoraCare-Paraguay main objective is to test a mHealth solution (MejoraCare app) to be used&#xD;
      for the education and empowerment of chronic patients (COPD, cancer, diabetes, heart disease.&#xD;
      hypertension, etc.), and for supporting healthcare professionals to monitor and better&#xD;
      understand patients' evolution during the COVID-19 outbreak (MejoraCare dashboard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mHealth solution is built upon the Adhera platform developed by Salumedia Labs, which&#xD;
      has already been validated in other therapeutic areas such as smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MejoraCare is expected to raise awareness, educate and empower chronic patients, promoting&#xD;
      behavioral changes towards adhering to healthier lifestyles thus reducing the risk of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection while providing emotional regulation support aiming at improving their&#xD;
      mental health, quality of life, and emotional well-being.&#xD;

      MejoraCare-Paraguay main objective is to test an mHealth solution (MejoraCare app) to be used&#xD;
      for the education and empowerment of chronic patients (COPD, cancer, diabetes, heart disease.&#xD;
      hypertension, etc.), and for supporting healthcare professionals to monitor and better&#xD;
      understand patients' evolution during the COVID-19 outbreak (MejoraCare dashboard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mHealth solution is built upon the Adhera platform developed by Salumedia Labs, which&#xD;
      has already been validated in other therapeutic areas such as smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its objective is two-fold: on the one hand, MejoraCare will provide the target population&#xD;
      with an educational resource to improve their self-efficacy and knowledge about the disease&#xD;
      and, on the other hand, to provide them with tools for the regulation of stress, anxiety and&#xD;
      negative emotions generated in this high-risk population due to the COVID-19 outbreak&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MejoraCare is expected to raise awareness, educate and empower chronic patients, promoting&#xD;
      behavioral changes towards adhering to healthier lifestyles thus reducing the risk of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, while providing emotional regulation support aiming at improving their&#xD;
      mental health, quality of life, and emotional well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized health education embedded into MejoraCare app covers the following topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention of COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinforcement of self-management behaviors for chronic conditions (e.g., physical&#xD;
           activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modules for improving resilience and coping skills related to stress and negative&#xD;
           emotions related to the COVID-19 outbreak (e.g., isolation at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For health care providers, MejoraCare dashboard provides the following functionalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Segmentation, monitoring, and follow-up of potential positive cases of COVID19 patients&#xD;
           and people at special risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support to patients undergoing quarantine at home recovery phase, including remote&#xD;
           monitoring of symptoms and a means to contact them in the cases that are deemed&#xD;
           necessary by the healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of MejoraCare-Paraguay are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To analyze the impact of the MejoraCare mHealth solution in terms of mental health,&#xD;
           quality of life, and emotional well-being in chronic patients at risk of COVID-19&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the acceptance of the technology by patients and professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expects to demonstrate the benefits that an mHealth intervention may have on&#xD;
      supporting mental health, quality of life, and emotional well-being for vulnerable patients&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;info-demia&quot; of constant news about the virus, along with the restrictive/lockdown&#xD;
      measures that are being enforced by the governments to reduce the pandemic progression pose a&#xD;
      great challenge for the emotional stress for people in general, and with a higher impact on a&#xD;
      vulnerable population, especially for those living with chronic conditions that seem to&#xD;
      worsen the prognostic in case of infection. Besides, as the pandemic continues its spread,&#xD;
      health services are being challenged due to the lack of resources to cope with such a high&#xD;
      demand for potential positive cases. In some cases, this affects the quality of care of&#xD;
      chronic patients, who also refrain from attending their routine appointments due to the fear&#xD;
      of infection. Therefore, reinforcement and behavioral guidance are needed to allow people&#xD;
      living with chronic conditions to know and understand which are the measures they need to&#xD;
      take to prevent the infection, or how to act in the event that they are infected. Besides, it&#xD;
      is necessary to provide this population with tools to support the prevention of psychological&#xD;
      and emotional problems that can worsen their health status and, therefore, their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mHealth solutions rely on a technology (smartphones) which already has a high level of&#xD;
      penetration in the population, makes their widespread highly scalable, and can be released&#xD;
      with relatively low costs. If developed under strong quality and safety requirements, they&#xD;
      can be a perfect fit for building public health strategies on top of them. On the other hand,&#xD;
      the lack of specific digital solutions to educate and empower chronic patients in disease&#xD;
      prevention techniques for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases with a relatively high&#xD;
      mortality rate among the vulnerable population like the seasonal flu puts them in an even&#xD;
      more risky situation to get infected.&#xD;
