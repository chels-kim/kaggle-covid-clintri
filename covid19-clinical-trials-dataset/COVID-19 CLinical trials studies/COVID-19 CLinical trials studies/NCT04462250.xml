  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A key driver of the current opioid overdose epidemic is the misuse of legitimately prescribed&#xD;
      opioid medications. Patient education through use of mobile technology may help to increase&#xD;
      knowledge of appropriate use of opioid medications; however, knowledge does not always&#xD;
      translate into behavior modification. Therefore, there is a need for more research into&#xD;
      patient-facing technology that can increase both knowledge and behaviors consistent with&#xD;
      appropriate opioid use. These needs have been amplified by the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exposed healthcare disparities,&#xD;
      heightened the risk for mental and behavioral health disorders, and dramatically increased&#xD;
      reliance on telehealth technologies. It is critically important that telehealth solutions be&#xD;
      accessible and user-friendly for all consumers, particularly members of underserved&#xD;
      communities with limited digital health literacy. This feasibility study will develop a&#xD;
      mobile health app to improve appropriate use of opioid medications among patients with a&#xD;
      prescription to treat non-cancer pain. The study will use focus groups with consumers and&#xD;
      providers to determine the content and features to be included in the app and will test the&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing a contingency management approach (i.e., rewards system) with the&#xD;
      app using a randomized control trial. The key outcome of interest is confirmation of the&#xD;
      design and operating specifications of the app, including the use of contingency management.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of interest are the overall rating of the app and an increase in knowledge&#xD;
      among users regarding the safe use, storage, and disposal of opioid medications.&#xD;
