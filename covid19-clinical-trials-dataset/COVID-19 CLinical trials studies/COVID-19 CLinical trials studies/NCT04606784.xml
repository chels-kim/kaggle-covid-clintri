&#xD;
          1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed with COVID-19, as evaluated by PCR test confirming infection with&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2, or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis based on radiological clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Respiratory distress as evidenced by at least two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest x-ray, CT scan, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recording of SpO2 ≤ 90% or the patient is requiring supplemental oxygen to&#xD;
                  maintain an SpO2 ≥ 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring supplemental oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of mild, moderate, or severe ARDS by Berlin definition&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A signed informed consent form from the patient or the patient's legal representative&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) or do-not-intubate (DNI) order in place&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal&#xD;
             failure, or significant liver abnormality (e.g. cirrhosis, transplant, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is on chronic immunosuppressive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. As a result of the medical review and screening investigation, the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator considers the patient unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A history of allergic reactions to human albumin (reaction to non-human albumin such&#xD;
             as egg albumin is not an exclusion criterion) or excipients in 5% human albumin&#xD;
             (N-acetyltryptophan, sodium caprylate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has known pregnancy or is currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in another clinical trial (not including treatments for COVID-19 as&#xD;
