      This Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit performance study will be used to establish the&#xD;
      performance of the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit as compared to a known high&#xD;
      sensitivity RT-PCR molecular assay. The results of this study will be used to demonstrate the&#xD;
      Lucira COVID-19 'swab to result in 30 minutes' test kit is similar in performance to known&#xD;
      high sensitivity best-in-class molecular assays performed in high complexity labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be combined with other studies the Sponsor has underway and&#xD;
      will support a FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test&#xD;
      Kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This performance study will include nasal swabs self-collected by study subjects at&#xD;
      community-based locations with trained medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject's participation in this study will consist of one study visit and one collection&#xD;
      event. The subject self-collects a nasal swab sample according to Lucira COVID-19 Test Kit&#xD;
      instructions and runs test according to Quick Reference Instructions (QRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit self-collection will be an additional swab&#xD;
      collection for reference method testing. One (1) additional NS specimen will be collected&#xD;
      either by the health care professional or self-collection, prepared in Transport Medium and&#xD;
      sent to a reference laboratory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single site study with community-based sampling in high COVID-19&#xD;
      prevalence communities in California. The Investigational device will be tested on-site and&#xD;
      the reference samples will be sent to one (1) reference laboratory in the U.S. Testing in the&#xD;
      reference laboratory will be performed by trained laboratory personnel. This study, to be&#xD;
      performed with medical staff on site, and will include nasal swabs self-collected by study&#xD;
      subjects per the QRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community based sampling will be conducted only by trained medical study staff. Study staff&#xD;
      will bring all study materials-the Lucira investigational device as well as the reference&#xD;
      swab collection kit-to all subjects enrolled in the study. This mobile, outdoor,&#xD;
      community-based sampling method will ensure that COVID-symptomatic persons with fever do not&#xD;
      travel from their homes, thus risking exposure to others. All medical staff participating in&#xD;
      the study will be under the oversight of the study Principal Investigators and wear&#xD;
      appropriate PPE during community visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified research person will be designated as the Investigator at each site, with the&#xD;
      responsibility for oversight of the study in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and&#xD;
      regulatory requirements. The protocol and subject informed consent will be reviewed by an&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) and written IRB approval will be issued prior to enrollment&#xD;
      of subjects into the study at that site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject's participation in this study will consist of a single visit. Following completion&#xD;
      of the informed consent process and a review of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to determine&#xD;
      eligibility, each subject will receive a unique study identification number. Subject&#xD;
      demographics including age, sex, race, and ethnicity, will also be collected at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be observed during the swabbing collection by the HCP and HCP will document&#xD;
      collection details and any collection issues. The HCP will confirm the Lucira COVID-19 Test&#xD;
      Kit is running and will interpret the test results once completed. Nasal swabs obtained from&#xD;
      self-collection will be discarded after it has been used for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Lucira COVID-19 Test Kit collection will be a collection for reference method&#xD;
      testing. A reference swab should not be collected until the Lucira Test Kit is running. The&#xD;
      nasal swab reference swab shall be collected in the same manner as the initial collection,&#xD;
      prepared in Transport Medium and sent to the Sutter Shared Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate performance, all reference samples collected will be tested using EUA-cleared&#xD;
      molecular method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay *&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference testing will characterize specimens as negative or positive for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
      Therefore, sensitivity and specificity of the Lucira COVID-19 Test will be calculated by&#xD;
      comparison with the reference methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional testing on remaining remnant aliquots may be performed to investigate any&#xD;
      discrepant and discordant results as needed, and samples may undergo additional testing by&#xD;
      other EUA-cleared molecular methods. The Roche Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay will be used for&#xD;
      discrepant testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subject consents to storage and future testing of samples, any extra remnants at the end&#xD;
      of the study will be returned to the Sponsor for storage.&#xD;

    <description>The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit is intended to detect the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 in nasal swab samples. This test is a single-use test kit that determines whether there is active shedding of the virus which causes COVID-19. This test utilizes a molecular amplification technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.&#xD;
Positive results are indicative of active infection with SARS-CoV-2. Persons who test positive should self-isolate and seek care from their healthcare provider.&#xD;
Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persons who continue to experience COVID-like symptoms should seek follow up care from their healthcare provider</description>
