      Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak seriously challenges worldwide health care&#xD;
      systems. The current climate of anxiety due to COVID-19 and home confinement limiting access&#xD;
      to emergency departments (ED) have induced an increase of phone calls to the emergency call&#xD;
      center &quot;15&quot; medical advices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if a pediatric telephone triage protocol may improve patient's pathways during&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak, parental compliance is assessed after telephone advice, during and after&#xD;
      home confinement (the end of home confinement in France was on May 11th 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 14th April 2020 to 7th June 2020, all calls received by the platform of telephone calls&#xD;
      at Children's Lenval Hospital during open hours and open days are collected. For each call,&#xD;
      symptoms are recorded by trained physicians and trained residents using a telephonic triage&#xD;
      tool through a directed interview. A medical orientation is recommended to parents at the end&#xD;
      of their call. Follow-up are conducted 2 to 4 days after with their consent by telephone&#xD;
      interview in order to evaluate their compliance&#xD;

      Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak seriously challenges worldwide health care&#xD;
      systems. The current climate of anxiety due to COVID-19 and home confinement limiting access&#xD;
      to emergency departments (ED) have induced an increase of phone calls to the emergency call&#xD;
      center &quot;15&quot; for medical advices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, Lenval Hospital pediatric ED didn't have a standardized telephonic triage protocol&#xD;
      fitted to COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, a telephonic triage tool is created as a decision&#xD;
      support system in order to help physicians in regulating patient's pathways and in providing&#xD;
      standardized medical advices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether a pediatric telephone triage protocol may improve patient's orientation&#xD;
      during COVID outbreak, parental compliance is assessed after telephone advice, during and&#xD;
      after home confinement (the date of end of home confinement in France is 11th May 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 14th April 2020 to 7th June 2020, all calls received by the platform of telephone calls&#xD;
      at Children's Lenval Hospital during open hours and open days are collected. For each call,&#xD;
      symptoms are recorded by trained physicians and trained residents of the pediatric emergency&#xD;
      department (PED) using a telephonic triage tool through a directed interview. A medical&#xD;
      orientation is recommended to parents at the end of their call. Follow-up are conducted 2 to&#xD;
      4 days after with their consent by telephone interview in order to evaluate their compliance.&#xD;
      Whatever the medical orientation given to parents, the investigators were able to visit PED&#xD;
      in case of worsening of their child's condition or whenever they would feel the need a&#xD;
      physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questioning parents about clinical condition of their child without a clinical look is&#xD;
      challenging: on the one hand, clinical status of any sick child may change quickly; In the&#xD;
      other hand, parents may not be reliable in evaluating their child's condition according to&#xD;
      their level of concern. COVID-19 outbreak context may exacerbate parental anxiety and&#xD;
      therefore induce inappropriate behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents was considered as &quot;non compliant&quot; if they haven't followed the orientation initially&#xD;
      given by the physician after telephone triage. They was considered as &quot;compliant&quot; (1) if they&#xD;
      have respected the recommended orientation or (2) if they have had to bring their child at&#xD;
      pediatric emergencies because of a worsening of his condition in the next 48 hours of the&#xD;
      first call. In this specific case, to determine if the consultation at pediatric ED was&#xD;
      necessary, the investigators recorded all resources utilization used and final orientation&#xD;
      decided after visiting the ED. Thus, worsening of a child condition was defined as&#xD;
      prescription of any diagnostic act and/or on-site therapeutic and/or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would allow to evaluate the applicability and the utility of a formalized&#xD;
      telephone triage protocol fitted to COVID-19 epidemic, performed by trained medical staff in&#xD;
      a Children's Hospital. Consequently, the investigators would be able to extend its use after&#xD;
      the COVID outbreak period&#xD;
