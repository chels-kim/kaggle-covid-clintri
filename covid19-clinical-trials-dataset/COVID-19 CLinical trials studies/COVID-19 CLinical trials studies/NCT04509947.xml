    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Local Adverse Events (AEs) for 7 days after First Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 (7 days after first vaccination on Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local AEs are pre-defined local (at the injection site) AEs for which participants are specifically questioned and which are noted by participants in their diary for 7 days post first vaccination. Solicited local AEs are: injection site pain/tenderness, erythema, swelling and induration at the vaccination site. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

             studies. Before randomization, participants who were born female must be either (a)&#xD;
             not of childbearing potential; (b) of childbearing potential and practicing a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception (failure rate of less than (&lt;) 1 percent (%) per&#xD;

             contraception from signing the informed consent until 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             study vaccine. Use of hormonal contraception should start at least 28 days before the&#xD;
             first administration of study vaccine. The investigators should evaluate the potential&#xD;
             for contraceptive method failure (example, noncompliance, recently initiated) in&#xD;
             relationship to the first vaccination. Highly effective methods for this study&#xD;
             include: (1) hormonal contraception: (i) combined (estrogen and progestogen&#xD;
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,&#xD;
             intravaginal, or transdermal); (ii) progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
             with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable); (2) intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD); (3) intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); (4) bilateral tubal&#xD;
             occlusion/litigation procedure; (5) vasectomized partner (the vasectomized partner&#xD;
             should be the sole partner for that participant; (6) sexual abstinence. Applicable to&#xD;
             Cohort 2 only: Before randomization, a woman must be (a) postmenopausal&#xD;
             (postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause) or permanently sterile; and (b) not intending to conceive by any&#xD;
             method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All female participants of childbearing potential must: have a negative highly&#xD;
             sensitive urine or serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening; have a negative highly sensitive urine beta-hCG pregnancy test immediately&#xD;
             prior to each study vaccine administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction for&#xD;
             a minimum 28 days after receiving the dose of study vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant agrees to not donate bone marrow, blood, and blood products from the first&#xD;
             study vaccine administration until 3 months after receiving the last dose of study&#xD;
             vaccine&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a clinically significant acute illness (this does not include minor&#xD;

             first dose of study vaccine; randomization at a later date is permitted at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigators and after consultation with the sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions&#xD;
