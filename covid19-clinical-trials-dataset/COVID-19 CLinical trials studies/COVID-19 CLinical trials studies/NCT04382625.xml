  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel coronavirus SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)-CoV-2 was first identified during&#xD;
      the outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 with the now resulting pandemic. Aggressive&#xD;
      supportive care is the mainstay of treatment currently and rescue with lung protective&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation is essential for survival in patients with severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome. Despite supportive care, mortality is significant in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      in the U.S., especially among patients &gt; 65 years of age. Pharmacologic treatments to&#xD;
      decrease disease severity are urgently needed. Hydroxychloroquine is currently widely used&#xD;
      for treatment of autoimmune disease including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, and it has been used to prevent and treat malaria. In vitro and in vivo antiviral&#xD;
      activity towards SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Since hydroxychloroquine has been used for&#xD;
      decades its properties as a drug are well known. The investigators propose a pragmatic trial&#xD;
      of hydroxychloroquine in moderately ill hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with&#xD;
      the hypothesis that hydroxychloroquine reduces severity of acute lung injury caused by&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

      Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first identified during the outbreak in Wuhan, China in&#xD;
      December 2019 with the now resulting pandemic. Aggressive supportive care is the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment currently and rescue with lung protective mechanical ventilation is essential for&#xD;
      survival in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite supportive&#xD;
      care, mortality is significant in hospitalized patients in the U.S., especially among&#xD;
      patients &gt; 65 years of age. Pharmacologic treatments to decrease disease severity are&#xD;
      urgently needed. Candidate treatments with antiviral activity and/or immune-modulating&#xD;
      effects include hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and tocilizumab&#xD;
      among others. There is limited high quality clinical data prompting a dilemma of how to use&#xD;
      and review potential treatments and ensure patient safety now as the pandemic begins to peak.&#xD;
      There are also significant limitations in drug supplies at many institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is currently widely used for treatment of autoimmune disease including&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, and it has been used to prevent and&#xD;
      treat malaria. In vitro and in vivo antiviral activity towards SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.&#xD;
      Since hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades its properties as a drug are well known.&#xD;
      Pertinent adverse events to monitor in a hospitalized patient include QTc (corrected QT&#xD;
      interval) prolongation, elevation of liver enzymes/acute liver injury, and hypokalemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute lung injury and progressive respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality in&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. In acute lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome, the severity of&#xD;
      hypoxia is categorized by the Pao2/FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) ration as mild (200 mm&#xD;
      Hg&lt;Pao2/Fio2≤300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg&lt;Pao2/Fio2≤200 mm Hg), and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ≤100&#xD;
      mm Hg). A persistently low Pao2/Fio2 ratio is associated with worse outcomes and may be a&#xD;
      marker of failure to respond to conventional therapy. PaO2/FIO2 is a clinically useful&#xD;
      measure in patients regardless of if they are receiving noninvasive supplemental O2 or&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, and low ratios are associated with duration of ICU stay and hospital&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care of hospitalized patients with covid-19 is evolving with hospital guidelines arising&#xD;
      across the U.S. with several commonalities. Patients receive clinical assessment, chest&#xD;
      x-ray, covid-19 testing, basic labs (WBC, CMP), and additional labs based on protocol or&#xD;
      clinical judgment (ABG, CRP-C reactive protein, LDH), antibiotics for possible bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia, acetaminophen for fever, supplemental O2, close monitoring for worsening&#xD;
      respiratory status and consideration for mechanical ventilation. Since covid-19 is a novel&#xD;
      illness, there is no proven clinically efficacious drug treatment. Candidate drugs are being&#xD;
      used, some in the context of trials and others by physician discretion. Early intubation over&#xD;
      escalating noninvasive support (ie. High flow nasal canula and bipap) has been adopted due to&#xD;
      the frequency of rapidly worsening oxygenation, hemodynamic instability, and to protect staff&#xD;
      from virus aerosolization. Low tidal volume ventilation and prone positioning are lung&#xD;
      protective strategies used in critically ill covid-19 patients that are based on management&#xD;
      of acute respiratory distress syndrome generally. Arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and shock are&#xD;
      serious complications from covid-19 that warrant avoidance of acidosis, electrolyte&#xD;
      monitoring and replacement, and pressor support. Conservative fluid replacement is used to&#xD;
      avoid worsening oxygenation. In sum, multiple factors including timeliness and quality of&#xD;
      care likely affect patient outcomes. Hospitalists and pulmonary critical care physicians&#xD;
      direct the care of covid-19 patients with support from specialists as needed including&#xD;
      infectious disease, cardiology, and nephrology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pragmatic trials focus on studying the real-world effect of an intervention, such as a&#xD;
      medication, in the context of other care a patient is likely to receive. The intervention is&#xD;
      delivered by staff normally taking care of the patient with monitoring that is routinely&#xD;
      available. Advantages can include generalizability, increased physician participation due to&#xD;
      less burdensome study protocols, and feasibility. Disadvantages include allowance of&#xD;
      unblinded design, bias from physicians and patients about the intervention, and more&#xD;
      heterogeneity in treatment than in a mechanistic protocolized trial. Efforts to minimize bias&#xD;
      include selecting objective outcomes (e.g. PaO2/FIO2 rather than cough or dyspnea).&#xD;
