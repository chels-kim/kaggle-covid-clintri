  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a cohort-randomized controlled trial of Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy-enhanced ShipShape (ACT+SS) compared to the standard ShipShape-only program, for&#xD;
      overweight or obese Navy personnel. As a result of COVID-19, this study is now being&#xD;
      conducted virtually.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a cohort-randomized controlled trial of ACT-enhanced SS (ACT+SS)&#xD;
      compared to the SS-only program. Cohorts of Navy personnel who are failing or at risk of&#xD;
      failing the body composition assessment (BCA) or who are overweight/obese will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive 8 weekly ACT+SS intervention groups or 8 weekly SS-only intervention groups. The&#xD;
      scientific aims are to: 1) determine the effectiveness of ACT+SS compared to the SS-only&#xD;
      program; 2) examine psychological flexibility as a mechanism underlying intervention&#xD;
      response; and 3) explore potential moderators of intervention response. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include BMI, body fat %, indices of physical activity, problem eating,&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life, emotional functioning and indices of psychological&#xD;
      flexibility, measured at baseline, mid- and post-intervention, and 3- and 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      and self- reported BCA status at 6-month follow-up. The investigators have purposefully&#xD;
      designed a cohort-randomized trial with interventions that are pragmatically implemented in a&#xD;
      real-life military setting, and outcomes that are immediately relevant to service members and&#xD;
      leadership. The cohort randomization is essential to the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      research in this setting. The military-relevant and generalizable findings are more likely to&#xD;
      have impact within the military. SS provides an ideal comparison arm that is the current&#xD;
      standard of practice in the Navy. Integrating ACT with SS in this setting overcomes many of&#xD;
      the logistical, practical, chain-of-command, and other challenges that have typically impeded&#xD;
      research in the military. The investigators have thoughtfully selected primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes that are theoretically linked, and additional assessments that are empirically-based&#xD;
      and will allow better understanding of mediators and moderators of intervention response in&#xD;
      Navy personnel. Due to Covid-19 we have adapted the interventions to be administered&#xD;
      virtually.&#xD;

These include: a) education for nutrition and physical activity; b) creating and documenting goals for weight loss and physical fitness; c) a food diary to track eating habits throughout the program; d) developing behavioral strategies to initiate/maintain an exercise program; e) monitoring of physical activity (pedometer provided by the study); and f) identifying and overcoming personal triggers for over-eating.</description>
