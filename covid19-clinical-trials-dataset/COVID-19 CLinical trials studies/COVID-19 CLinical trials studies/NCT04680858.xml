      Optimal communication is crucial for team work in high class endoscopy. Team work is highly&#xD;
      challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Necessary protective equipment as FFP-mask and face&#xD;
      shields impair communication significantly. Digital enhanced approaches to maintain team&#xD;
      communication during endoscopic procedures are mandatory not only in actual circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:A prospective, two-armed interventional study will be performed at an&#xD;
      endoscopy unit at a tertiary center. 200 endoscopic examinations (EGD, colonoscopy, EUS,&#xD;
      ERCP) were randomly assigned (1:1) to a group that was performed with DECT equipped endoscopy&#xD;
      team or with standard communication. All examinations were performed under protective&#xD;
      equipment. Primary outcome was rate of communication associated adverse events. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included team subjectively perceived comfort with DECT enhanced communication during&#xD;
      endoscopic work, duration of examinations, SAE.&#xD;
