  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS-LINK™ is comprised of networks working cooperatively to advance Multiple Sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      science and improve MS participant outcomes. In this study participants will be followed from&#xD;
      the time of consent through the lifetime of the study (currently 3 years), unless the&#xD;
      participant chooses to withdraw from the study. Collection of participant's medical history,&#xD;
      including MS and treatment history, will be automated through extraction from the&#xD;
      participant's electronic medical record (EMR) and other health information systems (for&#xD;
      example, radiology). Participants will complete patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and other&#xD;
      health-related information digitally. Participating participants will have access to their&#xD;
      own data in an ongoing manner via a web-based Participant Portal.&#xD;
