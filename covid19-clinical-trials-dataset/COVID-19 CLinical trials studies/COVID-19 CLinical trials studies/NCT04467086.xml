  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortages of intravenous sedatives due to increased ICU&#xD;
      patient admissions and greater use of mechanical ventilation. A shortage of sedatives is as&#xD;
      concerning as a shortage of mechanical ventilators since critically ill patients require&#xD;
      sedation for comfort and to tolerate mechanical ventilation. Anti-adrenergic medications are&#xD;
      increasingly recognized for their role in sedation of critically ill patients. Propranolol is&#xD;
      a plentiful and inexpensive, non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker with good penetration of&#xD;
      the blood-brain barrier, which can reduce agitation and arousal. The study team published a&#xD;
      single-centre retrospective study of 64 mechanically-ventilated patients which found the&#xD;
      initiation of propranolol was associated with an 86% reduction in propofol dose and a roughly&#xD;
      50% reduction in midazolam dose while maintaining the same level of sedation. Propranolol has&#xD;
      the potential to mitigate the threat posed by worldwide sedative shortages and improve&#xD;
      critical care management of patients who require mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to evaluate whether the addition of propranolol to a standard sedation&#xD;
      regimen reduces the dose of sedative needed in critically ill patients requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. This study is an open-label randomized controlled trial, single-blinded with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation. Both arms will receive sedation according to usual intensive care unit practice&#xD;
      with a sedative agent. The intervention arm will additionally receive enteral propranolol&#xD;
      20-60mg q6h titrated up over 24-48h until intravenous sedative doses have fallen to a minimal&#xD;
      level (propofol &lt;0.5mg/kg/h or midazolam &lt;0.5mg/h) or the maximum dose of propranolol is&#xD;
      reached. Intravenous sedative doses will be titrated downwards in response to sympatholysis&#xD;
      produced by the propranolol, as evidenced by a decreasing heart rate or blood pressure. The&#xD;
      control arm will receive sedation without the addition or propranolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the change in primary sedative dose from baseline to Day 3 of&#xD;
      enrollment. Analysis of the primary outcome will be a difference in differences; the change&#xD;
      in sedative dose from baseline to Day 3 in the intervention group versus the same change in&#xD;
      the control group. The Mann-Whitney U test will be used as a nonparametric test of&#xD;
      independent samples for this outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients often require sedation for comfort and to tolerate mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. There are internationally accepted guidelines for sedation of critically ill&#xD;
      patients, and dexmedetomidine and propofol are recommended as sedative agents over&#xD;
      alternatives, such as benzodiazepines. There is now a worrying shortage of propofol in&#xD;
      Canada, the European Union, and parts of the US. The supply of dexmedetomidine, an expensive&#xD;
      alternative to propofol, is now considered to be at risk. It is unsuitable as monotherapy for&#xD;
      deep sedation, and most hospitals in Canada limit use to 48h, due to high costs. This&#xD;
      therefore makes it inadequate for COVID-19 treatment. Other sedative agents for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation include benzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam), but these are associated with higher&#xD;
      mortality from sepsis, higher incidence of delirium, and longer length of stay in the ICU.&#xD;
      That notwithstanding, midazolam is also currently in short supply. Shortages of sedative&#xD;
      medications will be as impactful on critical care practice as shortages of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilators; propofol, midazolam, and dexmedetomidine were all listed on March 31, 2020 as&#xD;
      &quot;Tier 3 Shortages&quot; by Health Canada - having &quot;the greatest potential impact on Canada's drug&#xD;
      supply and health care systemâ€¦.based on low availability of alternative supplies, ingredients&#xD;
      or therapies.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In critically-ill patients, the sympathetic nervous system can become hyperactive, producing&#xD;
      neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE) to increase blood pressure and heart rate. In&#xD;
      the brain, a pontine nucleus called the locus ceruleus (LC) provides the majority of brain&#xD;
      NE. LC adrenergic input to the medial septal area and medial preoptic area of the forebrain&#xD;
      mediates arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympatholytics have previously been prescribed to manage agitation in critical illness.&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is one such example, an intravenous alpha-2 agonist, which readily penetrates&#xD;
      the central nervous system. It has an anti-noradrenergic effect in the locus ceruleus,&#xD;
      consequently increasing inhibitory GABA neuron activity in the forebrain. Clonidine, is an&#xD;
      oral and intravenous agent that is highly lipid soluble, with good penetration of the Central&#xD;
      Nervous System, has been well studied in the ICU environment. However a recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      showed clonidine use did not reduce length of stay or length of ventilation for critically&#xD;
      ill patients, and only led to a small reduction in the use of opioids. Propranolol is a&#xD;
      non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, approved for treating hypertension, angina,&#xD;
      arrhythmias, migraines and pheochromocytoma in Canada. It has also been used off label to&#xD;
      treat anxiety disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is a lipophilic molecule,&#xD;
      crosses the blood brain barrier, and can block the locus ceruleus' ability to activate the&#xD;
      forebrain, similar to alpha 2 agonists. In rat models, propranolol delays arousal from a&#xD;
      state of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extensive search of PubMed and Web of Science did not reveal published trials of&#xD;
      propranolol as a sedative agent in critical illness or mechanical ventilation. However,&#xD;
      propranolol was shown to significantly reduce agitation in a randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      patients with traumatic brain injury. Observational studies in traumatic brain injury have&#xD;
      shown that propranolol use is associated with a shorter length of hospital and ICU stay, and&#xD;
      possibly a lower mortality risk, without reports of significant side effects. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      of 10 randomized controlled trials in severely burned patients found propranolol reduced&#xD;
      hospital length of stay. Other studies have shown that propranolol may have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on catabolism in critical illness, and improve cardiac function and survival in&#xD;
      animal models of cardiac resuscitation. This study team published a single centre&#xD;
      retrospective study of 64 mechanically-ventilated patients which found that the initiation of&#xD;
      propranolol was associated with an 86% reduction in propofol dose, and an approximately 50%&#xD;
      reduction in midazolam dose, while maintaining the desired sedation target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If propranolol reduces sedative doses required by mechanically ventilated patients (either&#xD;
      with or without COVID illness) to the degree seen in this team's retrospective study, this&#xD;
      would effectively reduce usage of sedatives two- to seven-fold. The cost of the average daily&#xD;
      dose of propranolol used in the retrospective study (~120mg) would be $0.27 (pharmacy cost at&#xD;
      The Ottawa Hospital), and propranolol is in abundant supply in Canada and around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this data, propranolol may enable critical care providers to sedate mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients using their usual approaches except with substantially lower doses of&#xD;
      sedatives. This would not only extend the use of currently limited supply of sedatives, it&#xD;
      would significantly reduce medication costs in critical care units in Canada and worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the addition of propranolol to a standard sedation regimen reduce the dose of sedative&#xD;
      needed in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), 1:1 allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit who are anticipated to&#xD;
      require mechanical ventilation &gt;48h, who are requiring intravenous sedatives to achieve a&#xD;
      sedation goal that is anticipated to be stable for &gt;48h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive propranolol enterally at a starting&#xD;
      dose of 20mg every 6 hours for two doses, and then 30mg every 6 hours for four doses. This&#xD;
      dose will be titrated upwards every 24 hours depending on clinical response (40mg every 6&#xD;
      hours for four doses, 50mg every 6 hours for four doses, and 60 mg every 6 hours thereafter).&#xD;
      The maximum dose to be used in the intervention group is 60mg every 6 hours. Daily dose&#xD;
      titration will be guided by hemodynamic markers indicative of the expected sympatholysis from&#xD;
      propranolol. Upward titration of propranolol should coincide with a downward titration in&#xD;
      sedatives until a minimum level of sedative infusion is reached (propofol &lt;0.5mg/kg/h or&#xD;
      midazolam &lt;0.5mg/h). For each participant, the intervention will be administered from&#xD;
      enrollment until approximately 48h after the patient is liberated from the mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator, and the study will continue until hospital discharge or 28 days after enrollment,&#xD;
      if the patient is still alive. Enrollment can begin as early as 24h after the start of a&#xD;
      sedative infusion in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome and Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be a comparison of the change in primary sedative dose from baseline&#xD;
      to Day #3 of the study in the intervention group compared with the same change in the control&#xD;
      group- the difference in differences. Given the global need for a substantial reduction in&#xD;
      sedative consumption for mechanically ventilated patients, this study assumes that a 70%&#xD;
      reduction in sedative dose would be clinically meaningful, which corresponds to the&#xD;
      difference between the sedative infusion doses required for study eligibility (ie. propofol&#xD;
      &gt;1.5 mg/kg/h or midazolam &gt;1.5 mg/h) and the minimum doses below which propranolol would no&#xD;
      longer be increased (ie. propofol &lt;0.5 mg/kg/h or midazolam &lt;0.5 mg/h). Based on the mean +/-&#xD;
      SD daily dose of propofol at baseline (942 +/- 1629 mg) and on Day #3 (155 +/- 641mg) in&#xD;
      observational study, this trial should enroll 98 patients in a 1:1 randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to have 80% power to detect a significant difference with a one-tailed alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
      Allowing a 10% dropout rate (a previous study of sedation strategies at these sites reported&#xD;
      a dropout rate of 3%), this study will aim to enroll 108 patients (54 control; 54&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be analyzed as a difference in differences- the change in sedative&#xD;
      dose from baseline to Day #3 (defined as the 24h period starting 60h after enrollment) in the&#xD;
      intervention group vs the same change in the control group. The Mann-Whitney U test will be&#xD;
      used as a nonparametric test of independent samples for this outcome, as well as the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes that relate to sedative dosing on Day #3 compared to baseline. For&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, groups will be compared using unpaired statistical tests- Chi-square for&#xD;
      proportions, and unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate for parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric data. The effect of age, sex and gender, and pre-ICU beta-blocker prescription&#xD;
      will be analyzed as planned subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A No Objection Letter from Health Canada, Division 5, has been obtained to conduct this&#xD;
      clinical trial. Research Ethics Board approval is pending. An established data safety&#xD;
      monitoring committee will evaluate adverse events. An interim analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      after 50 enrolled patients, and the study will be terminated if the data safety monitoring&#xD;
      committee determines the risk of adverse events, based on the rate of adverse events reported&#xD;
      in this clinical trial to the committee, outweighs the potential benefits. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from each participant or their legal substitute decision maker.&#xD;
