      The purpose of this study is to determine how peoples' bodies respond to exposure to&#xD;
      COVID-19. Employees of Beaumont Health in Michigan who are older than 18 years may be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Participants from other high-risk groups who are not Beaumont&#xD;
      employees may also be recruited, as may family members of Beaumont employees who have tested&#xD;
      positive for COVID-19. Participants will have blood drawn two or more times for serology&#xD;
      testing. This serology test will determine if participants have detectable levels of the&#xD;
      antibodies that our bodies develop to fight COVID-19 infection. Participants will fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire each time they provide a blood sample. The questionnaires include questions&#xD;
      about participants' personal traits; their health; general questions about their risk to&#xD;
      exposure; job and risk of exposure; symptoms, diagnosis, treatment of COVID-19 since last&#xD;
      blood draw. Researchers will monitor participants' medical records in a confidential manner&#xD;
      for one year after the last blood draw to help determine if people who develop antibodies to&#xD;
      COVID-19 are protected against developing a COVID-19 infection in the future.There may be no&#xD;
      direct benefits for participants; however, information from this study may benefit other&#xD;
      people by increasing our understanding of COVID-19, how it spreads from person to person, and&#xD;
      how people respond to fight off the infection.The results of the serology test are used for&#xD;
      research only and will not affect clinical decisions regarding participants' treatment or&#xD;
      quarantine&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beaumont Health is an eight-hospital regional health care system with a total of 3,337 beds,&#xD;
      38,000 employees and 5,000 physicians in Southeast Michigan. In the first 3 weeks of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic within Michigan over 3300 patients tested positive through our system and&#xD;
      over 1000 have been admitted for inpatient care. COVID-19 has a wide range of presentations&#xD;
      from asymptomatic to multisystem organ failure and death. Spread from asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals has been described in the literature but the extent of this transmission is&#xD;
      unclear. Large scale serologic testing can help address this question by detecting antibodies&#xD;
      generated after an individual is infected with COVID-19. Healthcare workers have developed&#xD;
      COVID-19 but the true infection rate among those who care for COVID-19 patients and whether&#xD;
      the infection occurs at work is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day, thousands of Beaumont physicians, nurses, technicians and other caregivers are&#xD;
      working under extraordinary stress, doing their very best to care for patients with this&#xD;
      highly contagious and potentially deadly virus. They are trying to protect themselves from&#xD;
      infection while dealing with personal protective equipment requirements and limited knowledge&#xD;
      of who in the hospital environment may be carrying the infection and potentially spreading it&#xD;
      among the staff. Caregivers are at greater risk of infection than the public, and when they&#xD;
      become sick, it reduces the number of trained personnel available to care for hospitalized&#xD;
      patients. Serological testing would give Beaumont's front-line staff, family members and&#xD;
      patients peace of mind by determining infection rates in our care units. Knowing the&#xD;
      infection rates will demonstrate how effective the use of personal protective equipment has&#xD;
      been for staff, whether any flaws exist in the system, and how many clinical staff currently&#xD;
      have potentially protective antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beaumont Health has 2 EURO Lab Workstations capable of running the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA&#xD;
      EUROIMMUN serology assay (referred to as the EUROIMMUN assay hereafter). Each EUROIMMUN assay&#xD;
      consists of 2 separate tests; one of which measures IgG (the memory antibody which should&#xD;
      give long acting resistance to people who mount an immune response) and the second of which&#xD;
      measures IgA (the secretory antibody that should protect against infection through mucous&#xD;
      membranes). Researchers can run 5,000 samples a day with each sample being tested for IgA and&#xD;
      IgG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants (employees and affiliated non-employed physicians and advanced&#xD;
      practice providers) will provide informed consent. Researchers will analyze all participants&#xD;
      over 2 blood draws between 2 and 4 weeks apart to see if they developed antibodies to&#xD;
      COVID-19. Participants at medium risk for exposure in their job function at Beaumont will&#xD;
      have 3 draws 2-4 weeks apart and people considered the highest risk, those who provide the&#xD;
      direct patient care to COVID-19 patients, will be tested 2-4 weeks apart until the pandemic&#xD;
      in Michigan is under control (estimated to be 8 blood draws). If the participants agree,&#xD;
      researchers will bank 0.5 ml of serum for future testing related to COVID-19. An initial&#xD;
      questionnaire and subsequent questionnaires with each blood draw will be completed by&#xD;
      participants. Biostatistics will analyze the data from the questionnaires and the serology&#xD;
      test to determine any links between level of risk associated with the participants job,&#xD;
      medical history, and exposure history to development of COVID-19 antibodies. Participants&#xD;
      medical records will be monitored for one year to see if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      if they have a positive PCR test for COVID-19 since they were tested for the presence of&#xD;
      antibodies. All employees identified as developing COVID-19 after their antibody levels were&#xD;
      tested will be analyzed and a correlation between antibody level and development of COVID-19&#xD;
      will be generated. This will allow an estimation of the protective effect of antibodies&#xD;
      relative to people who have no detectable antibodies. Researchers will perform an&#xD;
      epidemiologic analysis to identify contacts between staff and patients based on records in&#xD;
      the EMR and can cross reference to determine if nosocomial transmission is likely occurring&#xD;
      from staff to patients and vice versa. Researchers will also determine if there was any&#xD;
      likely exposure to patients with COVID-19 on the same floor or if prior patients in the room&#xD;
      had COVID-19. This will also allow researchers to model the rate of spread of the virus&#xD;
      within the hospital from unknown sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional studies on subpopulations of participants will test whether antibody tests on&#xD;
      dried blood spots (small drops of blood applied to filter paper, which do not have to be&#xD;
      refrigerated) correlate with results obtained from drawing a full vial of blood.&#xD;
      Reproducibility, stability, the effect of shipping, inter-lab concordance and any differences&#xD;
      between participant-collected and phlebotomist-collected blood spot samples will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional subpopulation study will test immediate family members of participants who test&#xD;
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to evaluate intra-family spread of the disease. Another&#xD;
      subpopulation study will recruit participants from other high-risk populations at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
