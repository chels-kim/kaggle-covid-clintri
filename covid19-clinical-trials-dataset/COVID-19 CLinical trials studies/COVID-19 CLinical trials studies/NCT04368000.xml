    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication among patients with severe&#xD;
      disease. In a report of 138 patients with COVID-19, 20% developed ARDS at a median of 8 days&#xD;
      after the onset of symptoms, with 12.3% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Efficacious therapies are desperately needed. Supportive care combined with intermittent&#xD;
      prone positioning may improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone positioning (PP) of patients with severe ARDS (when combined with other lung-protective&#xD;
      ventilation strategies) is associated with a significant mortality benefit. In addition, PP&#xD;
      for &gt;12 hours in severe ARDS is strongly recommended by clinical practice guidelines. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to compare the outcomes of prone positioning versus usual care positioning&#xD;
      in non-intubated patients hospitalized for COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and&#xD;
      rapidly spread worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a&#xD;
      pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The clinical disease (COVID-19) is mild in 81% of patients,&#xD;
      severe disease occurs in 14%, and 5% of cases result in critical illness. The reported&#xD;
      overall case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.3% in China, although the CFR varies widely (0.7- 7.2%)&#xD;
      between regions. Older age is associate with increased mortality. The reported CFR is 8%&#xD;
      among patients 70-79 years old and 15% in those 80 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple therapies have been proposed based on in vitro evidence or anecdotal reports.&#xD;
      Although, no high quality clinical trials have demonstrated an effective treatment regimen&#xD;
      other than supportive care. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major&#xD;
      complication among patients with severe disease. In a report of 138 patients with COVID-19,&#xD;
      20% developed ARDS at a median of 8 days after the onset of symptoms, with 12.3% of patients&#xD;
      requiring mechanical ventilation. Efficacious therapies are desperately needed. Supportive&#xD;
      care combined with intermittent prone positioning may improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone positioning (PP) of patients with severe ARDS (when combined with other lung-protective&#xD;
      ventilation strategies) is associated with a significant mortality benefit. In addition, PP&#xD;
      for &gt;12 hours in severe ARDS is strongly recommended by clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
      Improvements in gas exchange, cardiac output, and clearance of secretions have been&#xD;
      demonstrated with PP, and are thought to contribute to the survival benefits. Low quality&#xD;
      evidence from case series and retrospective studies in awake, spontaneously breathing&#xD;
      patients suggest PP is feasible, improves oxygenation, and may avoid the need for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. A recent prospective observational study of early PP combined with high-flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation was well tolerated and may help patients&#xD;
      avoid intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center non-blinded randomized controlled pragmatic feasibility study&#xD;
      comparing the outcomes of prone positioning (intervention) versus usual care (control) in&#xD;
      non-intubated patients hospitalized for COVID-19.&#xD;
