  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, the investigators will compare vital parameters measurements obtained&#xD;
      using continuous data from reference monitors and continuous wireless MultiSense® monitoring&#xD;
      patch in 60 post-ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients and over 7 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MultiSense® strip is a unique, band aid-sized, clinical signal quality, connected strip&#xD;
      for real-time monitoring of cardio-respiratory parameters. The MultiSense® strip measures in&#xD;
      real-time, remotely and continuously 11 clinical key-indicators by being attached to the&#xD;
      patient thorax: ECG trace, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate and&#xD;
      relative respiration depth, pulse transit time, plethysmographic trace, perfusion index, skin&#xD;
      temperature, physical activity and body position. Designed to be worn continuously for at&#xD;
      least seven days, the patient can keep the patch during his sleep or in the shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the quality of measurements of clinical signs provided&#xD;
      by MultiSense® strip in comparison to measurements made with conventional medical devices in&#xD;
      the hospital setting, in terms of accuracy, connectivity, generation of artifactual data and&#xD;
      stability of data transmission. The study population includes 60 patients transferred to&#xD;
      post-ICU units for a minimum of 5 days. Once in the post-ICU unit, the MultiSense® strip will&#xD;
      be attached on patient's thorax. The monitoring will last between 5 to 7 days.&#xD;
