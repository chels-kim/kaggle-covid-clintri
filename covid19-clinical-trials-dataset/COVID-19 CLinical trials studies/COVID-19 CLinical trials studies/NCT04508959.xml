      The McMaster Multi-Regional Hospital Coronavirus Registry (COREG) is a platform that is&#xD;
      collecting detailed case data on laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital inpatients and&#xD;
      outpatients. The COREG platform will provide rapid high-quality evidence to improve the&#xD;
      prevention and clinical management of COVID-19 for older adults in Canada, and&#xD;
      internationally. The COREG platform will also provide researchers and partners with complete&#xD;
      regional level clinical data on COVID-19 cases to inform rapid decision-making and&#xD;
      projections, sub-studies, extensions, and linkage for all affected populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving pandemic,&#xD;
      which poses a major and ongoing threat to health and the health system both globally and&#xD;
      locally. While there have been country-specific case series that have offered some guidance&#xD;
      on interventions that may be effective; applying them to local settings is problematic, given&#xD;
      differences in population density, demographics (including vulnerable sub-populations),&#xD;
      economic and political capacity. To this end, local data is needed to better inform on the&#xD;
      timing and implementation of specific and targeted interventions to mitigate the spread and&#xD;
      impact of the virus immediately, and thereafter. Near real-time information can greatly&#xD;
      inform efforts and decisions needed to address resource allocation in response to the dynamic&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The Investigators' aim is to collect data on the impact and burden of COVID-19&#xD;
      that can inform and support real-time local clinical and policy decisions. Specifically, the&#xD;
      objectives are to: 1) Create a COVID-19 admission case registry as a local research and&#xD;
      quality improvement platform for the COVID-19 pandemic; and 2) Collect data that can inform&#xD;
      local pandemic decisions and evaluation, including incidence, vulnerability, complications,&#xD;
      and clinical course of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators have established the McMaster Coronavirus (COVID-19) Registry&#xD;
      (COREG), an ISARIC-WHO compatible, comprehensive platform that facilitates uniform data&#xD;
      collection of COVID-19. COREG is an extension of the ISARIC-WHO case report form (CRF)&#xD;
      designed to capture local information on transmission, disease- burden, course, and outcomes&#xD;
      of COVID-19 cases from all COVID-19 charting hospitals in the Waterloo, Hamilton, and Niagara&#xD;
      Regions of Ontario, Canada (Population &gt; 1,500,000). COREG is a comprehensive patient&#xD;
      registry based retrospective data collection on all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases&#xD;
      (according to the ISARIC definition) admitted to St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton (SJHH),&#xD;
      Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS), Grand River Hospital, St. Mary's General Hospital, and the&#xD;
      Niagara Health System. The registry includes data abstracted from existing chart data&#xD;
      generated during routine clinical care. A waiver of informed consent is granted. Data&#xD;
      categories to be collected follow the ISARIC-WHO CRF&#xD;
      (https://isaric.tghn.org/covid-19-clinical-research-resources/) and include demographics,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, pre-admission medications, signs and symptoms, diagnostic results,&#xD;
      in-hospital interventions and health outcomes (medical complications during hospitalization&#xD;
      including ICU and death). Cases are identified by the Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC)&#xD;
      at each site and records will be accessed remotely and securely by research and medical&#xD;
      staff. Extracted data are stored in a secure McMaster hosted REDCap and data server. Data&#xD;
      collectors undergo a standardized training. Weekly governance meetings occur between the data&#xD;
      collectors, operational leads and clinical site lead at each site to discuss, address and&#xD;
      resolve any barriers and inconsistences in data collection and advance the scientific agenda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: COREG ensures that COVID-19 data collected are standardized and robust and will have&#xD;
      a meaningful impact on local decision-making, while also being comparable internationally.&#xD;
      COREG will shape consensus recommendations on inpatient management of hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19. It will be invaluable to local and global research efforts, since linkage to&#xD;
      tissue biobanks and other administrative databases can be easily performed to address&#xD;
      questions on pathophysiology, long-term outcomes and healthcare burden.&#xD;
