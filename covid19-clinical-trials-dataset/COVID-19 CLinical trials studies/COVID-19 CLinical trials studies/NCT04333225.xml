    <textblock>
      In order to assess the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine treatment weekly for a total of 7 weeks&#xD;
      in the prevention of COVID-19 infection, three hundred sixty (360) Healthcare workers with&#xD;
      high risk exposure to patients infected with COVID-19 will be tested for COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab once weekly for 7 weeks. Of those, one hundred eighty (180) will&#xD;
      receive weekly doses of hydroxychloroquine for the duration of the study. Subjects who opt&#xD;
      not to receive the study drug will form the control group.&#xD;
