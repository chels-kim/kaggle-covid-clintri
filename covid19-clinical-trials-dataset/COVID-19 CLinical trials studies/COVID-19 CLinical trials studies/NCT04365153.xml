      TThe purpose of this prospective, Phase 2, single center, blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      study is to demonstrate as a proof of concept that early treatment with canakinumab prevents&#xD;
      progressive heart and respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 infection. These results&#xD;
      will lead to and inform a Phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase 2, single center, blinded randomized-controlled study designed&#xD;
      as a proof of concept to demonstrate that early treatment with canakinumab prevents&#xD;
      progressive heart and respiratory failure in patients with COVID 19 infection, myocardial&#xD;
      injury and hyperinflammation. These results will lead to a Phase III randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in approximately 7 months total, starting from the first patient&#xD;
      enrolled with enrollment expected to complete within 2 months. The follow-up period is 5&#xD;
      months for each patient enrolled. The end of the study, including statistical analysis and&#xD;
      drafting of the final report is expected within 1 month from the last patient enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 45 patients will be randomized using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio: 15 subjects will&#xD;
      receive 600 mg intravenous canakinumab (8 mg/kg if &lt;/= 40 kg), 15 subjects will receive 300&#xD;
      mg intravenous canakinmab (4 mg/kg if &lt;/= 40 kg), and 15 patients will receive placebo&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, clinical team, and subject will be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
