      Aim: We aim to evaluate αvβ3 integrin expression in proven COVID-19 infected patients with&#xD;
      indicative findings on routine contrast-enhanced CT using [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2. If activated&#xD;
      vascular endothelium in the lung parenchyma proceeds ARDS, as frequently observed during&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, imaging αvβ3 integrin expression using PET/CT could have potential as a&#xD;
      clinical tool to characterize patients at early stages during disease and guide development&#xD;
      of novel treatments targeting the vascular endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective, observational non-randomized pilot study. Maximum 10&#xD;
      patients will undergo a [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 PET/CT scan and CT-subtraction scan in the same&#xD;
      procedure. 10-minutes/bed position static [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 PET/CT scans of the thorax&#xD;
      will be acquired starting at 60 minutes post injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Maximum 10 patients from the Infectious Diseases ward with proven COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and indicative pulmonary abnormalities on contrast-enhanced CT (CORADS 4-5) undergo&#xD;
      PET/CT scans after injection of 70 μg (200 MBq) [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 and CT-subtraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients will undergo a [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 PET/CT scan, and in the same&#xD;
      procedure, a CT-subtraction scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate and quantitate&#xD;
      activation of the endothelium in the lung vasculature using [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the spatial correlation between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 uptake and abnormal&#xD;
           findings on routine contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the spatial correlation between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 and CTS of the lung&#xD;
           parenchyma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the correlation between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 and laboratory results&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the correlation between [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(RGD)2 uptake and clinical course of&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
