    <textblock>
      A pilot study to investigate the effects of the prone positioning (PP) on hospital patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators that early self-proning may prevent intubation and improve mortality in&#xD;
      patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants with a primary diagnosis of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia will be&#xD;
      enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened and those that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled to one of two groups: one with prone positioning (on the belly) and the other&#xD;
      with standard supine positioning (on the back). The patient and nursing staff will monitor&#xD;
      times spent in various positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include incidence of intubation, max oxygen requirements, length of hospital&#xD;
      stay, ventilator-free days, worsening of oxygenation saturation, and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In hypoxic respiratory failure, placing patients in the prone position improves ventilation&#xD;
      to perfusion matching, alveolar recruitment, and alveolar to arterial oxygen gradients.&#xD;
      Specifically, in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS, proning intubated patients&#xD;
      improves overall mortality. With the emergence of SARS-COV-2, hospitals around the world have&#xD;
      seen a marked increase in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS. This&#xD;
      surge in cases has prompted a search for more effective strategies to reduce intubation and&#xD;
      improve patient morbidity and mortality. One such strategy is that of voluntary proning, in&#xD;
      which awake patients are instructed to prone themselves (Early PP With High Flow Nasal&#xD;
      Cannula (HFNC) Versus HFNC in COVID-19 Induced Moderate to Severe ARDS) (COVID-19&#xD;
      smArtphone-based Trial of Non-ICU Admission Prone Positioning (CATNAP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial proposes a voluntary proning strategy in patients admitted to the hospital, not&#xD;
      yet requiring mechanical ventilation. Given the clear evidence that proning improves outcomes&#xD;
      in ARDS, investigators hypothesize that early, voluntary self-proning may prevent intubation&#xD;
      and improve mortality in patients with SARS-COV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study of up to 100 participants at UCHealth facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed if they can self prone safely and be assessed against inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria within 12 hours of admission and randomized to either prone or supine&#xD;
      positioning. Baseline labs will be measured and all participants will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously via pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Standard Supine Control Group will utilize standard oxygen (O2) device in supine position&#xD;
      at approximately 30-60 degrees to target peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt;90%&#xD;
      and the participant or nurse will document time in non-supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Prone Experimental Group will position patient in approximately 15-degree reverse&#xD;
      trendelenburg and prone using pillows for comfort. The participant will be asked to rotate to&#xD;
      prone positioning every 2 hours while awake and encourage to sleep prone overnight as&#xD;
      possible with a goal of 10-12 hours daily. Patient to log all time prone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Failure may occur and termination of Intermittent Prone Positioning will occur.&#xD;
      This is defined as respiratory distress or a decrease in O2 saturations &lt;90% for more than 2&#xD;
      minutes as determined by bedside nursing or per virtual pulse oximetry monitoring&#xD;
      notifications during the study on two consecutive occasions. The participant will be returned&#xD;
      to supine positioning and follow standard supine oxygenation. The participant can be&#xD;
      re-challenged in the prone position after the participant stabilizes for 2 hours. The&#xD;
      participant can also choose to stop proning and would be considered a treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Sample Size In New York City the intubation rate has been reported&#xD;
      at 1/3 of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the hospital. The table below shows the&#xD;
      sample size needed for a binomial outcome of intubation when 50% of the sample is randomized&#xD;
      to Prone Positioning (PP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 Beta 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80 Probability of intubation with PP 0.05&#xD;
      0.10 0.15 0.20 Probability of intubation 0.33 0.33 0.33 0.33 Proportion receiving PP 0.50&#xD;
      0.50 0.50 0.50 Sample size 33 39 56 97&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expecting a 13% decrease in intubations with the prone position, investigators will use a&#xD;
      sample size of N = 100 (50 per group) in order to have 80% power with a two-sided alpha =&#xD;
      0.05 for logistic regression. ANCOVA will be used to evaluate continuous, secondary variables&#xD;
      in order to adjust for covariates. The study is powered for the primary outcome of intubation&#xD;
      or no intubation. No adjustments will be made for the secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators and statistician will validate the data and the study will be subject to&#xD;
      institutional quality assurance reviews.&#xD;
