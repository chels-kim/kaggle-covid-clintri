  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine whether lower-risk activities displace&#xD;
      participation in higher-risk behaviors during COVID-19. Investigators will test this aim by&#xD;
      promoting specific activities that are expected to be low-risk when it comes to COVID-19&#xD;
      transmission (e.g., participating in a hiking challenge) and assessing impacts on&#xD;
      participants' activity choices. Investigators also aim to describe adults' activity&#xD;
      participation during COVID-19 generally and to examine secondary outcomes, including reported&#xD;
      stress and sleep.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to examine whether lower-risk activities displace&#xD;
      participation in higher-risk behaviors during COVID-19. Investigators will test this aim by&#xD;
      promoting specific activities that are expected to be low-risk when it comes to COVID-19&#xD;
      transmission and assessing impacts on participants' activity choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two study groups, Group 1 and Group 2, each of which will complete 3 online&#xD;
      surveys and will be provided with information on lower-risk activities to do during COVID-19.&#xD;
      Random assignment to groups will occur after the completion of a baseline survey. Group 1&#xD;
      will receive free access to a local hiking challenge after completing their baseline survey&#xD;
      and an information sheet with current CDC-recommended activities after post-test. Group 2&#xD;
      will receive the same resources, but in the opposite order. Therefore, surveys administered&#xD;
      at midpoint (~6 weeks) and post-test (~12 weeks) will allow for a test of the effects of&#xD;
      providing access to the hiking challenge on outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants choose to sign up for the hiking challenge, they receive a list of local&#xD;
      hikes/nature walks, accompanying maps, scavenger-hunt-like activities (finding a certain&#xD;
      landmark on each hike), and the opportunity to earn prizes and engage with other hikers on&#xD;
      social media. The primary outcome will be the activities in which participants engage. An&#xD;
      adapted version of the Pleasant Activities list (Koks) will be used to assess activities&#xD;
      participants have engaged in during the past 30 days at baseline, midpoint (~6 weeks), and&#xD;
      post-test (~12 weeks). Current CDC guidance will be used to code activities as lower- and&#xD;
      higher-risk anticipating the creation of an aggregate frequency of activities in each of the&#xD;
      following categories: activities done outdoors alone or with members of the household (lower&#xD;
      risk), activities done indoors alone or with members of the household (lower risk),&#xD;
      activities done outdoors with others not in one's household (moderate risk), and activities&#xD;
      done indoors with others not in one's household (higher risk). Adults' participation in&#xD;
      different types of activities will also be summarized generally, in addition to specific&#xD;
      activities of interest (e.g., the lower risk activities that are being targeted, like hiking;&#xD;
      and activities that have received attention as being particularly higher risk, like indoor&#xD;
      restaurant dining). Investigators will also examine impacts of the provision of the hiking&#xD;
      challenge on secondary outcomes, including reported stress and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the potential to shed light on displacement of higher-risk activities through&#xD;
      promotion of lower-risk activities that could serve as substitutes. It also allows for an&#xD;
      assessment of the impacts of the local hiking challenge on aspects of well-being.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will indicate the frequency that they complete various activities using an adapted version of the Pleasant Activities List (Koks). Frequencies of each activity are indicated on a 0-4 scale where 0=never in the past 30 days and 4=very often in the past 30 days/more than 1 time per week. For each activity, participants will also indicate if it was done indoors or outdoors and who was there. We will aggregate the frequencies of activities that are lower-risk for COVID-19 transmission based on CDC recommendations at the time of the study. We anticipate that two indicators of lower-risk activities will be those completed outdoors by oneself or with individuals in the household and those completed indoors in which only the self or those in the household are present.</description>
