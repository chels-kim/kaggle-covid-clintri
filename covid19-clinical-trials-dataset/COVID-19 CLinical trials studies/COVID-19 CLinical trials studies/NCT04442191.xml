  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are ill with COVID-19 may benefit from receiving convalescent plasma infusions&#xD;
      containing antibodies from donors who have recovered from the disease and are proven to no&#xD;
      longer be infected. Given the current public health emergency due to COVID-19, the FDA has&#xD;
      recently fast-tracked the use of convalescent plasma. The purpose for this study is to assess&#xD;
      if convalescent plasma collected from donors previously infected with Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, can provide&#xD;
      clinical benefit to those acutely ill with the virus and to evaluate if such treatment is&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two arms in the interventional study, where subjects will either be treated&#xD;
      with convalescent plasma or fresh frozen plasma in a randomized and blinded manner. As an&#xD;
      additional comparison, the clinical course of subjects enrolled during the period of the&#xD;
      study who do not receive an alternative treatment for COVID-19 will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design and Procedures - Comparison group (no-treatment control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be identified by reviewing a REDCap database containing the list of all&#xD;
           patients at the University of Illinois at Chicago Hospital (UIC) who were tested for&#xD;
           COVID-19. Using these data, the investigators will identify those subjects who are &gt;40&#xD;
           years old, were admitted to the hospital during the period of the study, otherwise met&#xD;
           all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the infusion arm of the study but were&#xD;
           not enrolled and did not receive any medications for treatment of COVID-19 (were treated&#xD;
           with only supportive care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical data from the hospital admissions of these subjects will be entered into a&#xD;
           REDCap database. The same clinical information captured for subjects who underwent&#xD;
           transfusion (vital signs, oxygen status, etc.) will be entered into this database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures - Intervention arms Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients admitted to UIC Hospital and meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
           after documentation of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enrolled subjects will answer a symptom screen, undergo a physical exam, and have&#xD;
           clinical data extracted from their chart (including medical history, demographic&#xD;
           information, vital signs and documentation of oxygen requirement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women of childbearing age will be asked if there is a chance that they might be&#xD;
           pregnant, if they are currently breastfeeding, and if they are planning to become&#xD;
           pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood will be drawn for a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and blood type and screen, and a&#xD;
           sample of blood will be stored for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs will be collected for Reverse&#xD;
           Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A study investigator will ask the patient's primary team if they are planning on&#xD;
           treating the patient with Remdesivir. If the patient qualifies for this medication, the&#xD;
           study investigator will monitor the patient's chart and work with the patient's nurse to&#xD;
           ensure that the first convalescent plasma infusion and first dose of Remdesivir are&#xD;
           given within 24 hours of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures - Transfusion Visits (Study days 0 and 1) Note - the first&#xD;
      transfusion visit may be done on the same day as the screening visit if time permits,&#xD;
      otherwise it will be done the following day. Items 1 and 2 will only be performed for the&#xD;
      first transfusion visit if the visit occurs the day after the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient's clinical status, oxygen requirement, vital signs, and physical exam will&#xD;
           be extracted from their clinical chart. Extracted information will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. imaging: chest X-ray or chest CT results&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. labs: CBC with differential, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
                (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Demographic and medical information: history of present infection (length of&#xD;
                symptoms prior to presentation, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will be asked a symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization to convalescent plasma or fresh frozen plasma will be 1:1. Randomization&#xD;
           will be conducted by a physician not involved in the study and using pre-prepared lists&#xD;
           with random permuted blocks of varying sizes. This physician will hand-deliver an order&#xD;
           sheet for either convalescent or fresh frozen plasma to the blood bank (this way no&#xD;
           orders that could potentially unblind study personnel will be in participants' charts).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The blood bank technical staff will select either two compatible blood-type&#xD;
           non-therapeutic units of plasma or two compatible units of convalescent plasma,&#xD;
           depending on which group the patient has been randomized to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the blood bank does not have any product of that patient's blood type, investigators&#xD;
           will not be able to have the subject complete the remainder of the study. However, the&#xD;
           investigators will keep the information about the participant's blood type in the study&#xD;
           database. Then, in the event that plasma of the appropriate blood type is obtained,&#xD;
           study investigators may contact participants to find out if they are still interested in&#xD;
           being part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The blood product will be delivered to the floor and the participant's nurse will infuse&#xD;
           and document plasma administration following UIC Hospital policy &quot;TX 5.03.&quot; Study&#xD;
           subjects will receive 1 unit of plasma the first day, with the second unit being given&#xD;
           the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Once the blood product has been hung, the patient's nurse will place it in a bag that&#xD;
           will prevent the patient or physician's taking care of the patient from seeing whether&#xD;
           the unit is regular frozen plasma or convalescent plasma. The nurse will be under&#xD;
           instructions not to convey information about which type of plasma was used to the study&#xD;
           team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The nurse will be instructed to stop the transfusion while a small sample of plasma&#xD;
           remains in the bag. The bag will then be sent back to the blood bank (this is usual&#xD;
           protocol for blood products), and remaining plasma will be emptied into a storage&#xD;
           container, labeled with the patient's study identification number, and frozen for later&#xD;
           use for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. If a transfusion reaction occurs the transfusion will be stopped and reported to the&#xD;
           blood bank as stated in UIC Hospital policy &quot;TX 5.03.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures - Post-infusion monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-transfusion clinical data will be collected from electronic medical record daily&#xD;
           for days 2-8 following the first transfusion (or until the participant is discharged if&#xD;
           they are discharged prior to 8 days following transfusion). This information includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. symptoms: cough, dyspnea, shortness of breath&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. oxygenation: oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen requirement, supplemental&#xD;
                oxygen method (e.g., ventilator, nasal canula, prone positioning, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. imaging: chest X-ray or chest CT results&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. labs: CBC with differential, CRP, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, creatinine (and&#xD;
                whether or not the patient has required renal support)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. medications: antibiotics and anti-viral medications, neuromuscular blocking agents,&#xD;
                vasopressors&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. location: intensive care unit, discharged, regular hospital bed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant will have a swab sample for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR collected daily for days&#xD;
           2-8 following the first transfusion (or as many days as they are admitted if they are&#xD;
           discharged prior to 8 days following the first transfusion) and on day 14 following&#xD;
           plasma infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will also have blood drawn on days 2, 4, and 8 following the first plasma&#xD;
           infusion for measurement of antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 (if they are discharged prior&#xD;
           to day 4 or 8 they will not undergo that day's blood draw).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient is discharged prior to 14-days following infusion of plasma, they will be&#xD;
           asked to return to Project Wish on day 14 post- infusion of plasma for a blood draw (for&#xD;
           antibody titers), a nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab (for RT-PCR testing) and to&#xD;
           answer a short symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient will be contacted by telephone (if discharged) at 28-days following plasma&#xD;
           infusion and will be asked a symptom questionnaire. If they remain in the hospital at&#xD;
           this time point, they will be asked this questionnaire (if capable) and will have&#xD;
           information regarding their clinical condition extracted from their chart.&#xD;
