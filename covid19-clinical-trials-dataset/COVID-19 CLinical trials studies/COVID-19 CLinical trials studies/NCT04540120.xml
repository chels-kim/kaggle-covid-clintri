  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of orally administered NLRP3&#xD;
      inhibitor, dapansutrile, for the treatment of moderate COVID-19 symptoms and early cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome (CRS) in an ambulatory, at-home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection from a new strain of severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by fever, cough&#xD;
      and shortness of breath, which in certain patients can lead to systemic organ failure and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data show that SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune signaling sensor NLRP3. Activation&#xD;
      of NLRP3 initiates the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which includes the production of&#xD;
      primary cytokine, IL-1, triggering an intense inflammatory response that is prevalent in&#xD;
      symptomatic COVID-19 patients. When CRS advances further to a fulminant 'cytokine storm', the&#xD;
      data show that respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a specific inhibitor of NLRP3, dapansutrile may reduce or prevent the hyperinflammation&#xD;
      associated with CRS by inhibiting the production of IL-1β early to arrest the progression to&#xD;
      a severe 'cytokine storm.' The end result would be a reduction in the need for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients to receive intensive medical treatment, allowing for fewer hospitalizations,&#xD;
      administration of mechanical ventilation and deaths.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating dapansutrile&#xD;
      versus placebo. Approximately 80 subjects randomized 1:1 (40 dapansutrile, 40 placebo) are&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening/Baseline/Day 1 Visit, subjects will provide informed consent, be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility, and be randomized/enrolled into the study. Subjects will also receive the&#xD;
      first dose of study drug at this visit once study eligibility has been confirmed, and the&#xD;
      second dose of study drug will be taken approximately 12 hours after the first dose. Study&#xD;
      drug will be continued twice daily (morning and evening doses) through Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial duration will be approximately 45 days for all subjects enrolled, with assessments&#xD;
      as follows: Screening/Baseline/Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 (±1 day), Day 29 (±3 days), and&#xD;
      Day 45 (± 3 days). The Day 29 and Day 45 follow-up visits may be conducted virtually via the&#xD;
      institution's telehealth process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to maintain two paper diaries at home daily for the first 14 days:&#xD;
      a dosing diary and a subject diary. The dosing diary will be used to record the number of&#xD;
      capsules taken each morning and evening. The subject diary will be used to record&#xD;
      temperature, oxygen levels, COVID-19 symptoms, and overall health (using the prior 24-hour&#xD;
      period for parameters requiring subject recall). The set of questions used in the subject&#xD;
      diary will also be administered to the subjects at the Screening/Baseline/Day 1Visit&#xD;
      (pre-dose), Day 15, Day 29, and Day 45 visits. Each subject will be provided a no-contact&#xD;
      thermometer and a hand-held pulse oximeter at the Screening/Baseline/Day 1 Visit for home&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 29 and Day 45, additional assessments of safety and clinical activity will occur. The&#xD;
      Day 29 and Day 45 follow-up visits will be conducted virtually via the sites' telehealth&#xD;
      process.&#xD;

               1. History of any of the following: residence in a congregate setting (e.g., jail or&#xD;
                  prison, homeless shelter, or chronic care facility), substance abuse (e.g.,&#xD;
                  injection or non-injection), health-care workers with unprotected exposure to&#xD;
                  subjects who are at high risk of TB or subjects with TB disease before the&#xD;
                  identification and correct airborne precautions of the subject or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Close contact (i.e., share the same air space in a household or other enclosed&#xD;
                  environment for a prolonged period (days or weeks, not minutes or hours)) with a&#xD;
                  person with active pulmonary TB disease within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of or currently active primary or secondary immunodeficiency;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Past or present requirement for oxygen (e.g., nasal cannula, proning, mechanical&#xD;
             ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications/therapies over the defined or planned&#xD;
             use of any concomitant medications/therapies during the&#xD;

             Treatment Period, including specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. use of ibuprofen or diclofenac&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. use of colchicine&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. use of systemic steroids within 30 days of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. use of janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. use of off-label agents (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, dexamethasone) and&#xD;
                  biologic and oral anti-cytokine agents (e.g., current treatment with adalimumab,&#xD;
                  infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, tocilizumab, sarilumab,&#xD;
                  anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept, baricitinib, tofacitinib, or upadacitinib);&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: During the treatment period a patient may meet the criteria for a treatment&#xD;
             approved by the FDA specifically for COVID-19 (e.g. remdesivir). In this situation the&#xD;
             investigator and medical monitor should confer and take the most appropriate decision&#xD;
             for the patient. If possible, the preference would be for the patient to complete the&#xD;
             14 days of dosing before adding on the 2nd treatment. If that is not possible the&#xD;
             preference would be for the patient to continue their 14 days on dapansutrile and&#xD;
             complete all study related visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known history of renal impairment (e.g., calculated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;&#xD;
             45 mL/min);&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Evidence of malignant disease, or malignancies diagnosed within the previous 5 years&#xD;
             (except for local basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the cervix uteri that has been excised and cured);&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of infection or known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV);&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any other concomitant medical or psychiatric conditions, diseases, or prior surgeries&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair the subject from safely&#xD;
             participating in the trial and/or completing protocol requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Individuals who have been in a chronic care facility in the past 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Individuals who are incarcerated;&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Participation in any clinical trial and/or use of any investigational product within&#xD;
             the immediate 30-day period prior to the Screening/Baseline//Day 1 Visit.&#xD;
