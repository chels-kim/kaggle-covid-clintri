  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will produce a low cost, ergonomic, hood integrated PAPR for use initially&#xD;
      within the NHS. It will focus on user centred design, engineering optimisation, feasibility&#xD;
      testing, certification and intellectual property protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the pre-CE marked Bubble PAPR prototype PPE in the clinical&#xD;
      environment and gather usability data from consenting participants (staff).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To develop low cost, ergonomic, personal protective equipment to prevent virus&#xD;
      transmission to NHS healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to address these problems by taking a user centred design approach to&#xD;
      develop and manufacture a highly functional Hood Integrated Personal Air Purifying Respirator&#xD;
      (HI-PAPR) at a low cost. The design team brings together Manchester University NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust (MFT) ICU frontline clinical staff, an experienced product design consultancy,&#xD;
      Designing Science Limited (DSL) and the technical expertise of the School of Engineering at&#xD;
      the University of Manchester (UoM). The project will run through a rapid design and&#xD;
      evaluation cycle in simulated and clinical environments to refine the concept to meet&#xD;
      regulatory requirements. The final product could be used in primary/secondary care and in the&#xD;
      community and will be ready for wide-scale manufacture and supply for the UK NHS within six&#xD;
      months of the project start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate Bubble PAPR in the clinical environment and gather usability data&#xD;
      from frontline healthcare staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Bubble PAPR will meet or exceed the British and European standards for PAPRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That participating staff who subsequently use the PAPR will rate the PPE as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More comfortable than current PPE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safer than current PPE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easier to communicate with colleagues than current PPE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easier to communicate with patients than current PPE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Do clinical staff report that the Bubble PAPR is more comfortable than current FFP3&#xD;
      facemasks.&#xD;
