  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effect of personalized support using instant messaging&#xD;
      application on alcohol drinking reduction in university students proactively recruited from&#xD;
      universities in Hong Kong.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The government has promoted Hong Kong as the Asian's wine hub with zero alcohol tax (ethanol&#xD;
      ≤30%) since 2008, which causes dramatic increases in alcohol drinking and binge drinking&#xD;
      rates. Alcohol use in youth is the leading cause of disability adjusted life-years loss. Most&#xD;
      adult drinkers start drinking at age 18-21. Evidence shows that alcohol brief intervention&#xD;
      (ABI) is effective reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol use in university students. The&#xD;
      proposed trial aims to enhance the ABI by incorporating information communication&#xD;
      technologies (ICTs) such as instant messaging (IM) Apps (e.g. WhatsApp and WeChat) to provide&#xD;
      personalized, real-time chat-based support led by nurses. The aims of study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the main effect of the Intervention vs. Control group on alcohol&#xD;
           consumption per week at 6-month (Primary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effects on alcohol consumption per week at 12-month, AUDIT scores at 6 and&#xD;
           12-month, perceived usefulness of IM app at 12-month, intention to use IM app to&#xD;
           reduce/quit drinking at 12-month, number of standard drinks, episode of binge drinking,&#xD;
           episode of heavy drinking, planned drinking, Academic Role Expectation and Alcohol&#xD;
           Scale, Alcohol Problems Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 4-item, Perceived Stress&#xD;
           Scale 4-item, Covid-19 related drinking behavioral changes, and self-efficacy to&#xD;
           reduce/quit drinking at 6-month and 12-month&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify mediators between intervention and outcomes to inform the potential&#xD;
           mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To qualitatively explore experience on the interventions for reducing alcohol use and&#xD;
           related harms&#xD;

    <description>The chat-based IM support is the extension of baseline ABI and regular e-messages, which aims to provide real-time behavioral and psychosocial support to reduce or quit drinking. It will be personalized according to the subjects' characteristics (gender, drinking pattern and alcoholic drinks preferences), intention to drink and specific questions regarding drinking. Through real-time chatting (text and/or voice), drinkers can acquire information on consequences of drinking and gain social support immediately to reduce intention to drink and alcohol consumption.</description>
