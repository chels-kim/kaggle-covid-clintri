  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of Isoquercetin in&#xD;
      preventing disease progression and symptoms improvement in mild-to-moderate hospitalised&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labelled, randomized and multi-centre clinical trial in subjects with RT-PCR&#xD;
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild-to-moderate symptoms, and who are currently admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital for diagnosis of COVID-19. The study has two arms: hospital standard COVID-19&#xD;
      care (Control group) and hospital standard COVID-19 care + Isoquercetin (Isoquercetin group).&#xD;
      The recruited subjects will be placed into either group by an electronic randomization&#xD;
      process. Patients in the Isoquercetin group will receive a daily dose of 1000 mg Isoquercetin&#xD;
      as 4 x 250 mg Isoquercetin capsules as add-on therapy in addition to the hospital standard&#xD;
      COVID-19 care. The Isoquercetin treatment will continue for 28 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Adults aged 18 years and above.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe or critical COVID-19, e.g.:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heart rate ≥ 125 beats per minute OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Respiratory failure, defined as clinical need for high-flow oxygen therapy, non-&#xD;
                  invasive positive pressure ventilation or endotracheal intubation and mechanical&#xD;
                  ventilation OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Shock, defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
                  &lt;60 mm Hg or requiring vasopressors OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Multi-organ dysfunction/failure (WHO Clinical Progression Scale score ≥6)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hospitalisation for reasons other than severity of COVID-19 or comorbidities (e.g.&#xD;
             social reasons, local policies, isolation/quarantine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active bleeding or high risk for bleeding (e.g. known acute gastrointestinal ulcer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of significant haemorrhage (requiring hospitalisation or transfusion) outside&#xD;
             of a surgical setting within the last 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Familial bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Severe hepatic and renal impairment as no safety and PK data of isoquercetin are&#xD;
             available in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current daily use of aspirin (&gt; 81 mg daily), Clopidogrel (Plavix), cilostazol&#xD;
             (Pletal), aspirin-dipyridamole (Aggrenox) (within 10 days) or considered to use&#xD;
             regular use of higher doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents as determined by&#xD;
             the treating physician (e.g. ibuprofen &gt; 800 mg daily or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concomitant use of Cyclosporine, Warfarin (Coumarin), TPA, strong inducer of CYP3A4,&#xD;
             or substrate of CYP3A4 with narrow therapeutic index.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to isoquercetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with isoquercetin, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with Isoquercetin. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known hypersensitivity to Isoquercetin, Quercetin, or to any of the excipients used in&#xD;
             the Isoquercetin capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient with history of poor compliance, or current or past psychiatric disease that&#xD;
             might interfere with the ability to comply with the study procedures or give informed&#xD;
             consent according to the judgment of the investigator or institutionalized by court&#xD;
             decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient with any condition that the physician judges could be detrimental to patient&#xD;
             participating in this study.&#xD;
