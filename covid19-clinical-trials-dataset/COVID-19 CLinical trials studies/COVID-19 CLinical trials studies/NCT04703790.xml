  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to address the factors associated with an individual's&#xD;
      personal willingness to get the vaccine and attitudes about potential public policy&#xD;
      approaches to implementation of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Additionally,&#xD;
      to evaluate how these attitudes change over time. The 1200 participants will be recruited by&#xD;
      Ipsos (Ipsos KnowledgePanelÂ®) from their nationally representative panel to participate in a&#xD;
      survey at Time 1 and 1 year later. The information collected will include demographics,&#xD;
      health status, household composition, experiences with COVID-19, attitudes about vaccines in&#xD;
      general, COVID-19 vaccine specific attitudes, willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      acceptability, and attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that those who live in urban areas and who are older, have greater knowledge of&#xD;
      COVID-19, who have known someone who was hospitalized for COVID-19, and have generally&#xD;
      positive attitudes about vaccines will be more willing to get a vaccine. The primary reasons&#xD;
      for willingness will be personal safety and desire to return to normal activities. The&#xD;
      investigators also anticipate that those who vary on socio-demographics (e.g., live in urban&#xD;
      areas, have more liberal political views), have greater knowledge of COVID-19, who have known&#xD;
      someone who was hospitalized for COVID- 19, and have generally positive attitudes about&#xD;
      vaccines will be more supportive of mandatory vaccination strategies. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that attitudes will change over time in response to the current status of the&#xD;
      pandemic and of available data about the vaccine's efficacy and safety.&#xD;

      The overall objective is to address attitudes about potential public policy approaches to&#xD;
      implementation of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine and&#xD;
      the factors associated with an individual's personal willingness to get the vaccine once&#xD;
      available, and to assess how these attitudes change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. To describe participants' perceptions of public health strategies including mandatory&#xD;
      vaccination requirements (e.g., travel, school attendance, work place requirements (e.g.,&#xD;
      schools, health care facilities, offices), working in a health care facility, health care&#xD;
      providers, living in residential facilities) and targeted age groups (e.g., children,&#xD;
      adolescents, adults, elderly).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. b. To determine how attitudes about strategies are related to socio-demographic&#xD;
           characteristics (e.g., age, education, race/ethnicity, political views and political&#xD;
           party affiliation, household structure), knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, personal experience&#xD;
           with the infection, and other vaccine attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Example hypothesis: Those who vary on socio-demographics (e.g., live in urban areas,&#xD;
           have more liberal political views), have greater knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, who have known&#xD;
           someone who was hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2, and have generally positive attitudes about&#xD;
           vaccines will be more supportive of mandatory vaccination strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. To determine the relationship of socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., age,&#xD;
           education, race/ethnicity, political views and political party affiliation, household&#xD;
           structure), knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, personal experience with the infection, and other&#xD;
           vaccine attitudes with willingness to get the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. To evaluate the primary reasons driving vaccine acceptance including safety issues&#xD;
      (personal, family, or global), desire to return to normal activities (e.g., school, work, or&#xD;
      social events), and desire to no longer need to wear a mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Example hypotheses: Those who vary on socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., live in urban&#xD;
      areas, who are older), have greater knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, who have known someone who was&#xD;
      hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2, and have generally positive attitudes about vaccines will be&#xD;
      more willing to get a vaccine. The primary reasons for willingness will be personal safety&#xD;
      and desire to return to normal activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third specific aim: This specific aim focuses on how the findings from aim 1 and aim 2 change&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a. To evaluate how national level perceptions of public health strategies (aim 1) and an&#xD;
      individual's personal willingness to get the vaccine (aim 2) change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the unknown trajectory, there are several possible scenarios. For example, if&#xD;
      nationally there is a decrease in new infections with lifting of the restrictions then the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that there will be an overall decrease in support for mandatory&#xD;
      strategies and in willingness to accept the vaccine. Alternatively, if new infections are&#xD;
      rising and restrictions are in place, then there will be an overall increase in&#xD;
      acceptability. The investigators are also prepared to adapt our surveys should one or more&#xD;
      vaccines become licensed and available prior to the time 1 or time 2 survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3b. The investigators will explore whether changes in perceptions of public health strategies&#xD;
      (aim 1) and an individual's personal willingness to get the vaccine (aim 2) vary based on&#xD;
      relevant socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., region of the country, political views and&#xD;
      political party affiliation, household structure, race/ethnicity) and, when appropriate,&#xD;
      changes within those characteristics (e.g., when rates of infections are changing&#xD;
      differentially across regions). The investigators also will explore whether changes in&#xD;
      perceptions of public health strategies (aim 1) and an individual's personal willingness to&#xD;
      get the vaccine (aim 2) vary based on perceptions of societal events. For example, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate if changes in vaccine attitudes are associated with regional&#xD;
      differences in whether cases are increasing or decreasing; changes in household structure&#xD;
      (e.g., the presence of elders in the home); or perceptions of media reports.&#xD;
