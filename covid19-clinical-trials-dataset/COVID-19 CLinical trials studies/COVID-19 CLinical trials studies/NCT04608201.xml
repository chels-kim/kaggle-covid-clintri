  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic represents a major therapeutic challenge. The&#xD;
      highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and the long&#xD;
      duration of the disease have led to a massive influx of patients admitted in health services&#xD;
      and intensive care units. To current knowledge, there is no treatment yet that that can&#xD;
      prevent infection from SARS-COV-2 virus, nor the disease progression to a severe form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily active smokers are rare among outpatients or hospitalized COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several arguments suggest that nicotine could be responsible for this protective effect thank&#xD;
      to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on epidemiological data and experimental data from scientific literature, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that nicotine could inhibit the penetration and spread of the virus and improve&#xD;
      the management of COVID19 , particularly in hospitalized patients to prevent adverse outcomes&#xD;
      (death, transfer to intensive care unit, care limitation, mechanical ventilation an high flow&#xD;
      oxygen).&#xD;
