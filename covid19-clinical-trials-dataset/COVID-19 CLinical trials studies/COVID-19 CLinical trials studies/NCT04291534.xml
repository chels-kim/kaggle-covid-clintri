  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current context of the Covid-19 health crisis leads to an over-solicitation of health&#xD;
      systems, with hospital staff in the front line. These personnel are undergoing high levels of&#xD;
      stress, an alteration of their life rhythm, but also of their health status and quality of&#xD;
      life at work. In addition, night work, through the disruption of circadian rhythms, has&#xD;
      consequences on physical and mental health. The more frequent worsening of the condition of&#xD;
      certain patients at night increases the burden and responsibilities of night staff.&#xD;
      Increasing the use of psychoactive substances (SPAs) can become a solution for managing&#xD;
      stress, work rhythms, sleep disorders and their consequences. This self-medication behaviour&#xD;
      is not without risks, neither for staff nor for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ALADDIN study is a project made up of 2 waves of questionnaires - one during and the&#xD;
      other after the Covid &quot;hospital&quot; crisis - filled in by the hospital night staff of AP-HP.&#xD;
      This project will assess the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on the quality of work life,&#xD;
      mental health disorders, post-traumatic stress and substance use of hospital night staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of psychoactive substance&#xD;
      consumption among the night shift healthcare workers of the AP-HP and to describe the&#xD;
      participants' quality of working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is prospective study using an online self-completed questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire was elaborated on the basis of the validated scales ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking,&#xD;
      and Substance Involvement Screening Test), AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorder Test, shortened&#xD;
      version) and HAD (for anxiety and depression) and on qualitative interviews conducted among&#xD;
      care staff working the night shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be completed at t0 (baseline) and 18 months after. This study will&#xD;
      provide data on the consumption psychoactive substances by night hospital workers adn their&#xD;
      quality of working life. It will also allow us to compare their consumption with the general&#xD;
      population, and to describe the risk factors influencing the consumption.&#xD;
