  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to find out whether the tonsils and nasal tissues of pediatric patients are the main&#xD;
      factors that protects the children's immune system against COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since it is known that the tonsil and adenoid tissues that are known as a secondary lymphoid&#xD;
      organ, which form the first line of defense, are more active in childhood than adults,&#xD;
      especially in the childhood age group, and since it has been scientifically shown that&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the pediatric age group overcome this disease&#xD;
      lightly than adults, we aimed to reveal whether the defined tonsil and adenoid tissues are&#xD;
      the main factors that protect the children's immune system against COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary outcome of our study was the evaluation of pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and who had COVID-19 infection in terms of adenoid and tonsillar tissue hypertrophy and the presence of chronic or recurrent infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>2020-2021</time_frame>
    <description>The structure of the tonsil and adenoid tissues will be examined by physical examination, and the presence of tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy, tonsillitis, and adenoiditis conditions will be identified. The severity of covid-19 will be determined according to the cases of patients with tonsil and adenoid tissue disorders, who are hospitalized in intensive care, have infiltration in the lungs, and receive oxygen support.</description>
