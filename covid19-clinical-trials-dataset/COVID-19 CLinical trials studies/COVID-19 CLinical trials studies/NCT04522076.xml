  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) and community-acquired pneumonia are significant problems&#xD;
      of modern medicine. Pneumonia is the most common severe complication of COVID-19. But at the&#xD;
      same time, COVID-19 is not the only cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Moreover,&#xD;
      pneumonia is only one of the numerous possible severe complications of COVID-19. Medical&#xD;
      centers specialized for the hospital treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 and&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia were organized in different regions of Russia during coronavirus&#xD;
      pandemic-2020. The indications for hospitalization to one of these centers based in the&#xD;
      National Medical and Surgical Center (NMSC) are: confirmed or suspected severe COVID-19 or&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective medical registry of such patients hospitalized to NMSC, is intended to analyze&#xD;
      and compare their clinical and instrumental data, co-morbidity, treatment, short-term and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes in real clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1. Hospital treatment in NMSC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of this stage: from the date of admission to the hospital up to the date of&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital / or up to the date of death during the reference&#xD;
      hospitalization. The date of admission to the hospital will be the date of enrollment to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of electronic health record data using the Medical Information System (MIS).&#xD;
      Assessment of the outcomes of the hospital phase (discharge from the hospital, death) and&#xD;
      significant events (acute respiratory and pulmonary failure, requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation; cardiovascular events - myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke, acute heart&#xD;
      failure, paroxysmal heart rhythm disturbances, bleedings, thrombosis of large vessels and&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications). A survey of patients to clarify data on risk factors, somatic&#xD;
      diseases, and drug therapy before hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 was diagnosed when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      infection was confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pneumonia was confirmed according&#xD;
      to computerized tomography (CT) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2. Prospective outpatient follow-up for 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of this stage: 24 months after discharge from the hospital This work will be&#xD;
      delivered by investigators from the National Medical Research Center for Therapy and&#xD;
      Preventive Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of long-term outcomes and events among residents of Moscow and the Moscow Region&#xD;
      according to a patient survey (contact by phone for 30-60 days, 6 months, 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      after discharge from the hospital) and medical records.&#xD;
