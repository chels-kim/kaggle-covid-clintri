  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 outbreak has affected health care of patients with rheumatic diseases;&#xD;
      telemedicine might help to assist patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine if a hybrid medical care model, which consists of&#xD;
      alternating face-to-face medical visits and video medical consultations, is not inferior, in&#xD;
      terms of the Patient Reported Outcomes measures (PROMs), to the face-to-face medical care&#xD;
      model, among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outpatients. We also aim to investigate if adherence&#xD;
      to RA-related treatment (considered a surrogate of patient´s education) might be improved&#xD;
      when patients are re-integrated to the health care system, irrespective of the health care&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico, COVID-19 pandemic still uncontrolled. Our Institution provides health care to 1500&#xD;
      RA patients/year and up to August 2020, it is estimated that 500 RA patients might be&#xD;
      affected, which is our target audience. Reinstalling institutional health care provision is&#xD;
      challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This a non-inferiority, cross-over study, with 2 intervention arms. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1. Six months of usual medical care model, followed by 4 months of a control&#xD;
      period, and 6 months of hybrid medical care model, or 2. Six months of hybrid medical care&#xD;
      model, followed by 4 months of a control period, and 6 months of usual medical care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following PROMs will be assessed at specific time points: disease activity/disease&#xD;
      severity (RAPID-3), disability (HAQ-DI), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), patient satisfaction&#xD;
      with the medical care model (questionnaire locally developed), patient´s adherence to medical&#xD;
      care (missed scheduled visits) and patient´s adherence to RA-related treatment (the&#xD;
      Compliance-Questionnaire).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This a non-inferiority and cross-over study, with a planned follow-up of 16 months, with 2&#xD;
      intervention arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1: Patients assigned to 6 months of usual medical care model, followed by 4&#xD;
      months control period, and finally 6 months of hybrid medical care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2: Patients assigned to 6 months of hybrid medical care model, followed by 4&#xD;
      months control period and finally 6 months of usual medical care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the mean disease activity of RA patients (as measured per RAPID-3), after 6&#xD;
           months since study entry, between patients assigned to intervention 1 and patients&#xD;
           assigned to intervention 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the RA patient´s quality of life (as measured per WHOQOL-BREF) and RA&#xD;
           patient's disability (as measured per HAQ-DI) after 6 months since study entry, between&#xD;
           patients assigned to intervention 1 and patients assigned to intervention 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the end of the complete follow-up period, for each patient, to compare the cumulative&#xD;
           RA disease activity during the 6 months period where patients received usual medical&#xD;
           care model, with the cumulative disease activity during the 6 months period where&#xD;
           patients received hybrid medical care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the end of the complete follow-up period, for each patient, to compare patient´s&#xD;
           satisfaction with usual medical care model and patient´s satisfaction to hybrid medical&#xD;
           care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of the complete follow-up period, for each patient, to compare patient´s&#xD;
           adherence to the usual medical care model with patient´s adherence to hybrid medical&#xD;
           care model.&#xD;
