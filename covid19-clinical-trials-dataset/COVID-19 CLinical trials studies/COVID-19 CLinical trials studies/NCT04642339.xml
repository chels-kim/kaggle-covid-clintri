      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial of immunogenicity, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2-induced&#xD;
      coronavirus infection in adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind (blinded for trial subject and the study physician), placebo&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial in parallel assignment of the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy&#xD;
      of the Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2-induced coronavirus&#xD;
      infection in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include 2,000 volunteers over the age of 18. After screening, they will be&#xD;
      randomised (3:1) into two groups - a reference group of 500 volunteers who will receive the&#xD;
      placebo and a study group of 1,500 volunteers who will receive the combined Gam-COVID-Vac&#xD;
      vaccine against SARS-induced coronavirus infection-СoV-2oV-2. The trial subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into five age strata: 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60 and 60+ years. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in the trial for 180±14 days after the first dose of the study drug/placebo and&#xD;
      will have one screening visit and five on-site visits to the study physician during the said&#xD;
      period. The study drug/placebo will be administered intramuscularly during vaccination visits&#xD;
      1 and 2 (day 1 and day 21±2). Follow-up visits Nos. 3, 4, 5 will be conducted on days 28±2,&#xD;
      42±2 and 180±14, respectively. Blood samples will be taken from certain subjects during the&#xD;
      following visits to assess the immunogenicity parameters on days 1, 42±2 and 180±14. During&#xD;
      observation visits, vital indicators will be assessed on all trial subjects and changes in&#xD;
      the subjects' condition and well-being will be recorded, observational visits may be remote,&#xD;
      using telemedicine (TM) technologies. Additionally, the trial subjects will be able to have&#xD;
      remote consultations with the study physician through the TM. Data from trial subjects will&#xD;
      be collected through electronic case report forms.&#xD;
