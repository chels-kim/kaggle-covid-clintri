      Specific Aim #1 (Feasibility; primary aim): To assess the feasibility of the PP-MI&#xD;
      group-based physical activity intervention and outcome assessments in patients with MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The PP exercises and MI-based goal-setting sessions will be feasible: most (â‰¥50%)&#xD;
      of participants will complete 6/9 exercises/sessions. Furthermore, the investigators will be&#xD;
      able to obtain objective physical activity measurement follow-up data from at least 80% of&#xD;
      enrolled participants at the end of the intervention and 24 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2 (Acceptability): To assess whether the intervention is acceptable to&#xD;
      participants, as measured by ratings provided after each PP-MI session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The intervention will be acceptable: participants will rate the PP-MI exercises&#xD;
      with a mean score of at least 7 out of 10 on ease of completion and helpfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3 (Outcomes): To assess whether this preliminary intervention appears to result&#xD;
      in improvement of physical activity, related health behaviors (sedentary time, diet quality),&#xD;
      psychological well-being (optimism, positive affect, anxiety, depression), and the&#xD;
      exploratory outcomes of MetS-relevant physiological markers (e.g., blood pressure, weight,&#xD;
      chart-reviewed lipids and HbA1C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis a: The intervention will lead to improvements in physical activity, related health&#xD;
      behaviors, optimism and positive affect, reductions in depression and anxiety at 9 weeks and&#xD;
      24 weeks compared to baseline (or the start of the intervention, for the WLC group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis b: The hypothesis is that there will be improvements in the exploratory outcomes&#xD;
      of the physiological markers, even if they do not reach significance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial will test a group-based PP-MI intervention adapted for patients&#xD;
      with MetS. MGH outpatient community clinics will serve as the sources of recruitment and the&#xD;
      sites of the groups. The investigators will recruit up to 64 patients with MetS to complete&#xD;
      the study and provide follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from the patients, care&#xD;
      providers, and the electronic medical record as required for characterization of the&#xD;
      population. This information will include medical data related to MetS (e.g., blood sugar,&#xD;
      blood pressure, body mass index, triglycerides, cholesterol), current medications, and&#xD;
      sociodemographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend 90-minute groups sessions that will be held at the clinics (MGH&#xD;
      Healthcare Centers). The overall structure of each session will be: 30 minutes for positive&#xD;
      psychology exercise review/discussion, 30 minutes for physical activity goal setting,&#xD;
      education, and discussion, and 30 minutes for a group walk or indoor exercises in inclement&#xD;
      weather. During times when in-person visits cannot happen (e.g., COVID-19), we will do&#xD;
      virtual group sessions instead of meeting at the clinics, conducted via videoconference&#xD;
      platform (i.e., Zoom). This study has been IRB-approved for waiver of informed consent&#xD;
      documentation, so we will receive informed consent from our potential participants via verbal&#xD;
      consent. We will mail/e-mail an IRB-approved study information fact sheet, providing them&#xD;
      written details about our study before obtaining verbal informed consent. Each participant's&#xD;
      verbal consent will be documented in REDCap. In addition, the group walks will not happen in&#xD;
      these particular circumstances, and all exercise will be done individually to comply with&#xD;
      social distancing measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be either randomized to an immediate intervention group or a wait-list&#xD;
      control (WLC) group. The wait-list control group will start the intervention at Week 10,&#xD;
      after the immediate intervention group completes its final session. Both groups will be asked&#xD;
      to wear an Actigraph GT3x+ accelerometer for 1 week at baseline, then week 9, and week 24 for&#xD;
      the intervention group, and at baseline, weeks 9, 17, and 33 for the WLC group.&#xD;
      Accelerometers such as this one are considered to be the standard for measuring habitual&#xD;
      physical activity. They are pedometer-size devices that attach to a belt and are worn at the&#xD;
      waist. Participants will also be given a wrist-worn Fitbit to keep, which they will be asked&#xD;
      to wear daily for the duration of the study in order to track their activity (steps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon beginning the groups, participants will be provided with a treatment manual with weekly&#xD;
      PP exercises, information about the importance of physical activity and related health&#xD;
      behaviors, and how to set goals to improve these behaviors. The PI or a trained substitute&#xD;
      will lead all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first session, in the PP portion, participants will discuss and be assigned the first&#xD;
      exercise- Gratitude for Positive Events- and will be instructed to complete the PP exercise&#xD;
      during the next week. Prior to completing the exercise, participants will be asked to rate&#xD;
      their current levels of happiness and optimism. Immediately after completing the exercise,&#xD;
      participants will rate the ease of exercise completion, overall utility of the exercise, and&#xD;
      their current levels of happiness and optimism, all using 10-point Likert scales. In the&#xD;
      first goal-setting session, the investigators will discuss the importance of physical&#xD;
      activity in MetS. Investigators will review instructions for Fitbit use and set a goal for&#xD;
      monitoring their baseline physical activity over the next week. Fitbits will not be used as&#xD;
      an outcome measure, but as a tool that participants can use to monitor their activity and set&#xD;
      goals. Finally, the last 30 minutes will be spent doing a group walk around the local clinic&#xD;
      neighborhood (or indoor exercise in the case of inclement weather). All group walks and&#xD;
      exercises will be done at a pace comfortable for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the 8 total weekly PP exercises, set physical activity&#xD;
      goals, and attend as many group sessions as they can.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sessions will include (a) a review and discussion of the past week's PP exercise, (b) a&#xD;
      discussion of the rationale of the next week's PP exercise using the PP manual, and (c)&#xD;
      assignment of the next week's PP exercise. For the goal-setting/MI portion, participants will&#xD;
      (a) review their goals and steps from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving&#xD;
      physical activity (e.g., monitoring physical activity, taking standing breaks), and (c) set&#xD;
      goals for the next week. The exercises and content for both PP and MI will be assigned in the&#xD;
      same order for all participants receiving them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 9 and 24 (Weeks 17 and 33 for the wait-list control group), participants will&#xD;
      complete the same self-report questionnaires that were administered at baseline. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect the Actigraphs at baseline, weeks 9 and 24 (baseline, Weeks 9, 17&#xD;
      and 33 for the WLC group) and upload the data to assess for valid wear time. If participants&#xD;
      have not worn them for enough time (&gt;4 days), the investigators will send it home with them&#xD;
      and ask them to re-wear it and mail it back.&#xD;
