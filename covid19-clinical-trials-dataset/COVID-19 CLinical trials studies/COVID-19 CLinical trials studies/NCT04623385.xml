      Clinical Role of Testosterone and Dihydrotestosterone and which of them should be inhibited&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients - A double-edged sword?&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 attacks and affects Males significantly more than females [1], [2]. Males with&#xD;
      COVID-19 are reported to die at twice the rate of females when they come infected with the&#xD;
      virus [3]. The upregulation of TMPRSS2 by androgens could explain the increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to COVID-19 in men.Contrary to expected, as a study demonstrated that The&#xD;
      expression level of TMPRSS2 increased 6-fold in androgen stimulated LNCaP cells, relative to&#xD;
      androgen-deprived cells[4]. But, surprisingly, low levels of testosterone led to the over&#xD;
      expression and upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, facilitating SARS-CoV-1 entry into&#xD;
      the alveolar cells, and deregulating a lung-protective pathway [5].According to literature&#xD;
      Dihydrotestosterone is many times more potent than testosterone, and many of the effects that&#xD;
      testosterone has in the body only happen after it is converted to dihydrotestosterone [6].&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesis that testosterone has better effect than dihydrotestosterone in case&#xD;
      of COVID-19, because a study found that DHT significantly induced the expression of TMPRSS2&#xD;
      [7]. And at the same time , decreased testosterone levels in critically diseased males&#xD;
      harmfully affect pulmonary endothelial cell functioning, impair the ability to clear the&#xD;
      virus , promote systemic . Obesity among males, promote defective immune response, , and also&#xD;
      generates more pro-inflammatory cytokines important in cell signaling, emanating in&#xD;
      increased, severe disease, worst outcome and vulnerability. Insufficient serum testosterone&#xD;
      level is a poor prognostic indicator for patients infected with COVID-19 by downregulation&#xD;
      pulmonary protective pathways [5], [8]. On the contrary, high testosterone levels can lead to&#xD;
      complication of thrombosis which is also one of the serious manifestations in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients[9]. Thereby we hypothesize that decreased testosterone levels in men have a direct&#xD;
      relation with the severity of infection and a worse outcome in COVID-19. In this case we&#xD;
      should found an appropriate treatment that induces testosterone level to introduce its&#xD;
      protective effect and up regulate pulmonary protective pathways and at the same time protect&#xD;
      against thrombosis and works to reduce the impact of dihydrotestosterone on lung cells&#xD;
      preventing up regulation of TMPRSS2, Her we shed new light on the appropriate treatment can&#xD;
      overcome the challenges that face testosterone therapy in the era of COVID-19 After searching&#xD;
      MEDLINE , PubMed, , Google Scholar, preprints and Controlled Trials until September , 2020 we&#xD;
      found that the appropriate treatment in this case is aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid in&#xD;
      combination with testosterone therapy, as more than one study found that 13 cis retinoic acid&#xD;
      reversibly and potentially inhibit the effect of dihydrotestosterone on different targeted&#xD;
      cells. In addition its impact on thrombin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase IIII trial. 1000 adult male and&#xD;
      female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below outlined inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After searching PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, preprints and Controlled Trials until&#xD;
      September , 2020 we found that the best and appropriate drug which can be combined with&#xD;
      testosterone replacement therapy is aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid owing to its impact on&#xD;
      DHT and thrombin in addition it can be given in the form of aerosol for targeting pulmonary&#xD;
      cells with minimal systemic side effects . As previous study found that testosterone therapy&#xD;
      (TTh) administration using both topical and injectable formulations yielded transient and&#xD;
      concomitant rises in both DHT and T, with higher Hct elevations in men with higher DHT and T&#xD;
      levels[38]. As Testosterone is converted to DHT by the action of 5 alpha-reductase enzyme at&#xD;
      these target tissues.[39]. DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2[31,4] and this will be&#xD;
      followed by the activation of COVID-2019 spike protein to bind to its ACE2 receptors in lung&#xD;
      which in turn makes it more vulnerable to covid-19. A study demonstrated that 13- cis&#xD;
      -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits dihydrotestosterone.[40] on contrary to&#xD;
      other selective inhibitor of serum DHT which led to sexual adverse effects because it usually&#xD;
      given systemically which increases the chance of systemic serious side effects . But 13- cis&#xD;
      -Retinoic acid will be given in the form of aerosol to avoid these systemic side effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, we suggest that 13- cis -Retinoic acid will downregulate TMPRSS2 expression&#xD;
      thorough temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the activation of&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 gene expression. Furthermore, 13- cis -Retinoic acid Found to exert potential effect&#xD;
      on thrombin as high testosterone levels can lead to thrombosis which is also one of the fatal&#xD;
      manifestations in COVID-19 patients .A study in vitro found that Retinoic acid showed the&#xD;
      highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin [41].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we hypothesize that any drug which downregulates TMPRSS2 expression through&#xD;
      targeting AR, AR co-regulatory factors, or AR downstream transcription factors might be&#xD;
      potentially effective against COVID-19 and is worth investigating under a clinical trial.&#xD;
