      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over&#xD;
      150,000 deaths. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 and for which there are currently no approved treatments. Here, the principal&#xD;
      investigator reported according to previous studies and research findings that Isotretinoin&#xD;
      can strongly inhibit both inflammation and viral entry in severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 infection via inhibiting the overproduction of early response proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (IL- 6 and tumor necrosis factors alpha ) which are over expressed in COVID-19 and&#xD;
      contributed to disease progression, poor outcomes, vascular hyperpermeability and multiorgan&#xD;
      failure in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS-CoV-2) and also,via&#xD;
      blocking COVID-19 entry by inhibiting androgenic factors that induce transmembrane protease,&#xD;
      serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression, In addition to inhibiting of Angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      2(ACE2) ,AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is&#xD;
      responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion and entry as opposed to ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or&#xD;
      angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) that upregulate ACE-2 receptors which might&#xD;
      increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications. Moreover, another study&#xD;
      demonstrated that isotretinoin is a potential inhibitor of papain like protease (PLpro) which&#xD;
      is a protein expressed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA and considered one of the proteins that should be&#xD;
      targeted in COVID-19 treatment. In addition, more than one study reported that 13 cis&#xD;
      Retinoic Acid induces CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Regulatory T Cells which their absence during acute&#xD;
      infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage In addition, isotretinoin was&#xD;
      reported to increase CD4 counts and markedly decrease viremia in HIV positive patients&#xD;
      suffering from acne vulgaris . Furthermore,a study reported that 13 Cis retinoic acid induced&#xD;
      significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 resulting in an immune response to dsRNA&#xD;
      intermediate . TLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB&#xD;
      activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs. The production of type I IFNs&#xD;
      is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected&#xD;
      cells. Isotretinoin induces mucosal IgA antibodies that are less prone to ADE phenomenon and&#xD;
      responsible for passive mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract. From this point, the&#xD;
      principal investigator expects that isotretinoin will be the Immunity passport&quot; in the&#xD;
      context of COVID-19 owing to its impact on ACE2 receptors, Memory T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio,&#xD;
      type I IFNs, TMPRSS2, TLR3, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), (PLpro), and&#xD;
      (Il-6).In addition, Isotretinoin therapy has furthermore anti-platelet and fibrinolytic&#xD;
      activities. that may protect patients with covid-19 from widespread blood clots.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase III trial. 10000 adult male and&#xD;
      female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below outlined inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 ,&#xD;
      AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over&#xD;
      150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues&#xD;
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa ,intestine, heart, kidney,&#xD;
      endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study&#xD;
      demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or&#xD;
      angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to&#xD;
      increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available&#xD;
      Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in&#xD;
      cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of&#xD;
      ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being&#xD;
      investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide,&#xD;
      methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of&#xD;
      which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study&#xD;
      demonstrated that isotretinoin is a potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitor which is&#xD;
      a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be&#xD;
      targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and&#xD;
      SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity&#xD;
      via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)&#xD;
      residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by&#xD;
      approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin&#xD;
      resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP&#xD;
      fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that&#xD;
      MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact&#xD;
      glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated&#xD;
      [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate&#xD;
      residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II&#xD;
      activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage,&#xD;
      which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates&#xD;
      many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular&#xD;
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically&#xD;
      down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the&#xD;
      AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with&#xD;
      receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1&#xD;
      mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition&#xD;
      of AT1,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) and ATRA may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via inducing the&#xD;
      antiviral immunity and this is discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of&#xD;
      cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus-infected cells , boosting the&#xD;
      numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A&#xD;
      recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte&#xD;
      counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This&#xD;
      process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines&#xD;
      associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17), followed by a massive release of&#xD;
      cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due&#xD;
      to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T&#xD;
      cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV However, the factors which might cause&#xD;
      the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain&#xD;
      uninvestigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China&#xD;
      demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α&#xD;
      concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α&#xD;
      concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly&#xD;
      higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD-1) as compared to&#xD;
      health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as&#xD;
      patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T&#xD;
      cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to&#xD;
      prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell&#xD;
      inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the&#xD;
      strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation&#xD;
      of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs&#xD;
      have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central&#xD;
      link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation&#xD;
      process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune&#xD;
      response. MERS-CoV-2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in-vitro&#xD;
      .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived&#xD;
      dendritic cells modulates innate immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study proposed that C -C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung&#xD;
      homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung&#xD;
      DCs-activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza&#xD;
      more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and&#xD;
      colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear&#xD;
      nCoV2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral&#xD;
      infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to&#xD;
      metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA&#xD;
      activates and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+&#xD;
      DCs are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become&#xD;
      effector T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is&#xD;
      an important signal that induces IgA-producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells&#xD;
      play essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acid (atRA) can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes&#xD;
      in vitro. 13-cis RA activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells&#xD;
      lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition&#xD;
      by MERS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover,&#xD;
      it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects.&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells&#xD;
      (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in in both patients and mouse models. .13Retinoic acid (RA)&#xD;
      is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which&#xD;
      express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active&#xD;
      metabolite, all-trans RA. All-trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are&#xD;
      expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and&#xD;
      differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions&#xD;
      with TGF-b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and,&#xD;
      Thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, principal investigator expects high inducing of Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid&#xD;
      treatment which will lead to T cells activation and migration with less exhaustion&#xD;
      phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this protocol treatment with retinoic acid will induce FOXP3 and&#xD;
      CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of&#xD;
      the host to limit tissue damage and inducesT cells which were dramatically reduced in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect protecting lung cells&#xD;
      and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α&#xD;
      which are induced and highly expressed in COVID 2019 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels&#xD;
      of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of&#xD;
      patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to&#xD;
      suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection&#xD;
      and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may&#xD;
      have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our&#xD;
      protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is&#xD;
      a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels .When the cholesterol level is&#xD;
      low specifically in the case of viral infection like COVID 2019 infection the immune system&#xD;
      is impaired and the antiviral immune cells will be declined and inhibited :-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell&#xD;
      proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a&#xD;
      mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level&#xD;
      is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a&#xD;
      major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and&#xD;
      ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA&#xD;
      could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATRA upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction&#xD;
      of ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells by up-regulating ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid treatment will highly induce T&#xD;
      cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, T helper via cholesterol efflux and inducing&#xD;
      ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) and protect lung and neural cells and inhibit COVID&#xD;
      2019 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is recognized by melanoma&#xD;
      differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and&#xD;
      endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This&#xD;
      recognition resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism,&#xD;
      virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites.&#xD;
      AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN-γ by suppressing TNF&#xD;
      production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of&#xD;
      PGE2 and COX-2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
      by inhibiting IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-β1-dependent trans differentiation of lung&#xD;
      fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid and other retinoid&#xD;
      analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at&#xD;
      least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of&#xD;
      10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. IL-10&#xD;
      production was inhibited by ATRA administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in&#xD;
      response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly&#xD;
      susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung&#xD;
      function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the&#xD;
      high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for&#xD;
      inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of&#xD;
      toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can&#xD;
      be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of&#xD;
      signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I&#xD;
      IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins&#xD;
      for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere&#xD;
      with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation&#xD;
      and evade the immune response. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of&#xD;
      toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and&#xD;
      retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in a time-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the&#xD;
      TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. In HUH-7&#xD;
      cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV-1 and induce the expression of IFN-β, which can enhance the&#xD;
      expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I IFN during WNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors treating the sickest Covid-19 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some&#xD;
      people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that&#xD;
      prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.As with so much else about the&#xD;
      Covid-19 response, health experts are learning about the symptom on the fly. Blood clots are&#xD;
      common in patients who are immobilized, but they seem to be smaller and cause far more severe&#xD;
      damage in some Covid-19 patients. Doctors have said they see patients with blood clots&#xD;
      forming not only in their lungs, but also in blood vessels. Autopsies have also revealed&#xD;
      blood clots in kidneys and other organs, which some experts say suggests an overwhelming&#xD;
      immune system response to the virus that inflicts harm on the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic&#xD;
      activities. A study investigated the in vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory&#xD;
      activities of retinoic acid and retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol&#xD;
      exhibited potent inhibition of thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml,&#xD;
      respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml,&#xD;
      respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives,&#xD;
      retinoic acid showed the highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the&#xD;
      androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to&#xD;
      prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral&#xD;
      receptor, and this is discussed as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical&#xD;
      factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of&#xD;
      its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and&#xD;
      given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is&#xD;
      an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMPRSS2, a key regulator in prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer&#xD;
      shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell lines strongly&#xD;
      upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal&#xD;
      side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue&#xD;
      compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2 gene is a partner in one of&#xD;
      the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG.&#xD;
      This fusion occurs in approximately 50% of primary prostate cancers among men of European&#xD;
      ancestry.While ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the&#xD;
      androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 with the ERG gene. The ERG gene is&#xD;
      consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate&#xD;
      cancers harboring the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2: ERG&#xD;
      fusion is lower in prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the&#xD;
      current COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2: ERG fusion- cancers also have a distinct set of&#xD;
      risk factors related to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically&#xD;
      determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor have a higher risk of TMPRSS2:&#xD;
      ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer but not of fusion-negative prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface&#xD;
      serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is&#xD;
      normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue,&#xD;
      though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs,&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR).&#xD;
      There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor&#xD;
      epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p &lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2&#xD;
      protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose&#xD;
      responsive manner&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women&#xD;
      show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than&#xD;
      men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with&#xD;
      the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the&#xD;
      Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men&#xD;
      are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there&#xD;
      admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the&#xD;
      devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less&#xD;
      than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the&#xD;
      first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health&#xD;
      research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and&#xD;
      just 20 per cent were in women - but the gap has narrowed over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation&#xD;
      between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this&#xD;
      data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey&#xD;
      women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided&#xD;
      infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated&#xD;
      cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell&#xD;
      TMPRSS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in&#xD;
      females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and&#xD;
      women. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males&#xD;
      followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex&#xD;
      steroids in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after&#xD;
      infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen did not&#xD;
      affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were&#xD;
      wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS-CoV&#xD;
      pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or&#xD;
      inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5α-Androstan-3α,17β-Diol) concentration in tissues and blood&#xD;
      because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be&#xD;
      activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be&#xD;
      significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of&#xD;
      flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by&#xD;
      DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT&#xD;
      and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on&#xD;
      expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because&#xD;
      increasing formation of androgenic hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits&#xD;
      Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13- cis -Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the&#xD;
      effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II&#xD;
      transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of&#xD;
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for membrane fusion. In&#xD;
      addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral&#xD;
      infectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study demonstrated that COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the&#xD;
      functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to&#xD;
      lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID-19&#xD;
      reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels&#xD;
      of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels&#xD;
      decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts&#xD;
      to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in&#xD;
      defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator&#xD;
      explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a&#xD;
      well-characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple&#xD;
      enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing&#xD;
      in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is&#xD;
      not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because&#xD;
      this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and&#xD;
      decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over&#xD;
      increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2.&#xD;
      because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and&#xD;
      activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading&#xD;
      to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2.&#xD;
      Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and&#xD;
      functional competence of spermatozoa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on this data and according to this protocol, The principal investigator expects and&#xD;
      suggests that retinoic acid is specific modulator of androgens specifically DHT not&#xD;
      testosterone and could reverse the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on&#xD;
      TMPRSS2 expression and prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID&#xD;
      2019 and the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).&#xD;
      (All ideas and michanisms specifically role of Androgen in TMPRSS2 activation in COVID-19:&#xD;
      Serendipity or opportunity for intervention and the inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang&#xD;
      II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell&#xD;
      fusion and entry included in the research protocol were submitted to Academy of scientific&#xD;
      research and technology - Egypt- on 1 April , 2020. in Call no. 2/2019/ASRT- Ideation Fund)&#xD;

      Promising features of COVID 2019 treatment according Principal Investigator Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This medication have the feature of Aerosolized Drug Delivery to increase its efficacy&#xD;
           beside Oral administration, Which makes it distinct from other medication in which&#xD;
           should dose be only given orally. A study demonstrated that treating with 13 cis&#xD;
           retinoic acid aerosolized via inhalation rout did not cause any damage in lung cells.&#xD;
           Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body&#xD;
           weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did&#xD;
           not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage. The results suggest that&#xD;
           administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to its&#xD;
           application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug concentrations in&#xD;
           the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells for efficacy&#xD;
           while avoiding systemic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A study demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic is used in treating Emphysema (emphysema is a&#xD;
           lung condition that causes shortness of breath)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ATRA has been reported to induce formation of new alveoli and returns elastic recoil in&#xD;
           the lung to approximately normal values in animal models of emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Strong expectation of complete COVID 2019 blockade from cell entry and infection&#xD;
           depending on strong ethics, researches and references.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Availability of our compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ease of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Expectation of COVID 2019 treating of by more than one distinct mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Expectation of High induction of anti- inflammatory T cells and significant inhibition&#xD;
           of IL-6 at low concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Controlling Accompanying cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. No interactions with Egyptian protocol drugs were found.&#xD;

        Safety and promising features of isotretinoin in tne era of COVID 2019 according Principal&#xD;
        Investigator Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. This medication have the feature of Aerosolized Drug Delivery to increase its efficacy&#xD;
             beside Oral administration, Which makes it distinct from other medication in which&#xD;
             should dose be only given orally. A study demonstrated that treating with 13 cis&#xD;
             retinoic acid aerosolized via inhalation rout did not cause any damage in lung cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body&#xD;
             weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did&#xD;
             not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage. The results suggest that&#xD;
             administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to&#xD;
             its application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug&#xD;
             concentrations in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells for efficacy&#xD;
             while avoiding systemic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A study demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic is used in treating Emphysema (emphysema is&#xD;
             a lung condition that causes shortness of breath)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. RA has been reported to induce formation of new alveoli and returns elastic recoil in&#xD;
             the lung to approximately normal values in animal models of emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Strong expectation of complete COVID -19 blockade from cell entry and infection&#xD;
             depending on strong ethics, researches and references.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Availability of our compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ease of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Expectation of COVID -19 treating by isotretinoin via more than one distinct&#xD;
             mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Expectation of High induction of anti- inflammatory T cells and significant inhibition&#xD;
             of IL-6 at low concentrations of isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Controlling Accompanying cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. No interactions with Egyptian protocol drugs were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. (13- cis -Retinoic acid ) can be given in the form of aerosol to avoid these systemic&#xD;
             side effects. A clinical trial conducted on 148 subject from 5 university hospitals to&#xD;
             evaluate the possibility of retinoids in the treatment of emphysema. The patients,&#xD;
             were randomized to receive 13-cis retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/day, daily or ATRA at either&#xD;
             low dose (1 mg/kg/day for 4 days/wk) or high dose (2 mg/kg/day for 4 days/wk), placebo&#xD;
             for six months, followed by a three-month crossover phase. then, they were observed&#xD;
             for an additional nine months before the final evaluation. In the trial, retinoids(13&#xD;
             cis retinoic acid ) were proven to be safe as the drug-related AEs were generally&#xD;
             mild[188]. A study reported that the application of aerosolized RA system led to a&#xD;
             rise of RA levels in lung, but not plasma. or liver. In lung concentration and levels&#xD;
             of retinol, retinyl palmitate and retinyl stearate also showed to be unchanged [189] A&#xD;
             study on rabbits demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic acid can be given in the form of&#xD;
             aerosol without serious side effects In this study repeated elevated doses of 13 cis&#xD;
             retinoic acid by inhalation caused moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic&#xD;
             examination of ten tissues including oesophagus and lung did not found any significant&#xD;
             inhalation-induced injury or damage therefore aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid might&#xD;
             provide sufficient therapy to the target cells in lung for efficacy while avoiding&#xD;
