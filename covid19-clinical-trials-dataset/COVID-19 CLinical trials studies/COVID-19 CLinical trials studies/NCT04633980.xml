  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is the agent responsible for a new infectious respiratory disease called Covid-19&#xD;
      (for CoronaVirus Disease 2019) which is mainly characterized by potentially severe and fatal&#xD;
      lung damage. The severity of the clinical signs associated with this pathology requires the&#xD;
      admission to hospital of approximately 20% of patients, 5%-10% of whom will be admitted to&#xD;
      intensive care. The most severe cases of this pathology begin with dyspnea which worsens&#xD;
      rapidly around the 7th-10th day of the disease into an acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) which requires the patient to be put under mechanical ventilation in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit and is responsible for the majority of deaths. Certain biological parameters&#xD;
      suggest a massive and brutal release of cytokines (interleukins IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 mainly)&#xD;
      secondary to a syndrome of macrophagic activation mainly in the pulmonary level. Several&#xD;
      therapeutic trials aimed at reducing or controlling this immune storm are in progress (anti&#xD;
      IL-6 antibodies, anti r IL6 Ab, corticosteroids). Molecular hydrogen acts on the final path&#xD;
      of this complex inflammatory cascade by inhibiting the cellular action of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species. Its early use combined with nasal oxygen therapy could prevent this worsening of the&#xD;
      respiratory system, so could be likely to limit the risk of overflow of intensive care&#xD;
      services during the pandemic and save lives. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of hydrogen therapy delivered by a nasal cannula in&#xD;
      addition to conventional oxygen therapy in patients with moderate Covid-19&#xD;
