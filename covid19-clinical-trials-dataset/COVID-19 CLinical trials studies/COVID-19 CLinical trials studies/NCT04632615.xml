  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is becoming increasingly evident that sleep plays an essential role for human health, and&#xD;
      it represents an important biophysiological variable for athletes' well-being and recovery.&#xD;
      The International Olympic Committee recently highlighted the importance of obtaining&#xD;
      sufficient sleep volume and quality among athletes, but acute sleep deprivation is not&#xD;
      unusual. Several factors, both endogenous and exogenous, are able to negatively influence&#xD;
      sleep in athletes: body temperature, altitude, chronotype, training volume, anxiety, westward&#xD;
      and eastward travels, and many others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since December 2019, when a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was originally revealed by an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist in Wuhan (Hubei province, China), a related severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      - namely COVID-19 - has been spreading at a pandemic rate, putting global health systems&#xD;
      under unprecedent pressure. Italy, as the first Western country tremendously hit by this&#xD;
      disease outbreak, has become the iconic resilient outpost under international policymakers'&#xD;
      attention. When initial clusters were identified, restrictive actions to curb isolated&#xD;
      upsurges of infection were taken by the health region system of Lombardy, thereafter, were&#xD;
      extended to all northern Italy and to the entire country. From February 21, when the first&#xD;
      Italian COVID-19 case was diagnosed in southern Lombardy, to March 22, when Italian's&#xD;
      government restrictions to contain the pandemic were extended, prohibiting all non-essential&#xD;
      business activities and banning all movements of people nationwide, the country faced an&#xD;
      unchartered scenario, from several standpoints, along with the psychosocial one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inevitably, the Covid-19 outbreak has largely influenced the daily life of athletes too.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to examine the differences in athletes' sleep&#xD;
      quality, quantity and training volumes during the social confinement due to the virus&#xD;
      outbreak. For this purpose, a survey will be used. This variables will be evaluated in 3&#xD;
      different time frames: 1) May 2020; 2) September 2020; 3) January 2021.&#xD;
