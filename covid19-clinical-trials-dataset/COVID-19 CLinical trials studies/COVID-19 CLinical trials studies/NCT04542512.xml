    <textblock>
      Gangrenous cholecystitis is the most common complication of acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data showed that COVID-19 patients have a high risk to present necrotic&#xD;
      cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cholecystitis under COVID-19 pandemic WSES (ChoCO-W) study aims to investigate risk&#xD;
      factors and high-risk patients to develop necrotic cholecystitis during this pandemic.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gangrenous cholecystitis is the most common complication of acute cholecystitis affecting&#xD;
      around 15% (range 2-30%) of patients and it occurs as a result of ischemia with necrosis of&#xD;
      the gallbladder wall [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is related to an increased mortality rate (mortality rate ranging between 15 and 50%)&#xD;
      compared with non-necrotic acute cholecystitis[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies that investigated risk and predictive factors related to gangrenous&#xD;
      cholecystitis showed that males, older patients with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and&#xD;
      other comorbidities are at risk to present with gangrenous cholecystitis. [1-3] Another study&#xD;
      identified longer delay time prior to hospital admission and low white blood cell count as&#xD;
      independent risk factors affecting mortality and indicated the presence of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      higher blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase and total bilirubin, pericholecystic fluid in abdominal ultrasonography, and&#xD;
      conversion from laparoscopic surgery to open surgery as risk factors increasing mortality [2]&#xD;
      In any case, the treatment of GC is similar to that of patients with AC but in the presence&#xD;
      of GC, cholecystectomy can be difficult because of adhesions, insufficient anatomic control,&#xD;
      complications like bleeding, and injury to bile ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is high variability in the reported conversion rate to be 30% to 50% [4], down to 8.7%&#xD;
      [5]. These results are probably due to a careful preoperative selection of patients for&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy and early surgery [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hunt et al [7] reported decreased morbidity and mortality rates with the implementation of&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy for GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onder et al [2] showed that mortality was higher in cases in which conversion to open surgery&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, many authors reported necrotic and perforated cholecystitis as the most common&#xD;
      complication of COVID-19 pneumonia [8-9-10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent multi-society position paper suggested to consider percutaneous drainage of the&#xD;
      gallbladder after the failure of conservative therapy with antibiotics but highlighted that&#xD;
      advanced age, or other factors of higher COVID-19 risk, cannot be regarded as sufficient to&#xD;
      indicate this alternative treatment except in real conditions of the impracticability of&#xD;
      cholecystectomy [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lack of evidence and guidelines about the management of a patient with acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, at most preceded by&#xD;
      percutaneous trans-gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) in high surgical risk patients, remains the&#xD;
      gold standard for the treatment of acute cholecystitis on COVID-19 patients, with high&#xD;
      morbidity rate and length of hospital stay that increases the risk of spreading the virus&#xD;
      among health care staff and negative COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study all patients presenting acute cholecystitis to improve their management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the management of acute cholecystitis focusing on the treatments and the outcomes&#xD;
      of operative or non-operative management in COVID (+) and COVID (-) patients with the aim to&#xD;
      improve outcomes, decreasing morbidity and mortality rates related to emergency setting and&#xD;
      high-risk surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the prevalence of cholecystitis, in female and male patients during COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the risk factors for necrosis or gangrenous cholecystitis in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the clinical outcomes of early (&lt;72h from the onset of symptoms) versus delayed&#xD;
           (&gt;72h from the onset of symptoms) cholecystectomy, and of cholecystostomy in terms of&#xD;
           mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that COVID-19 patients should not be treated conservatively (antibiotics&#xD;
      only/ percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder and antibiotics) for the high risk of&#xD;
      progressing to necrotic and then perforated cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was reported that COVID-19 disease predisposes to both venous and arterial&#xD;
      thromboembolism, explained by excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and diffuse&#xD;
      intravascular coagulation. In particular, critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed a&#xD;
      high risk to present thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the risk factors for necrotic cholecystitis in the general population and to&#xD;
      assess the right timing for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Multicenter Observational Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to the surgical department with clinical and histological diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis (with and without gangrenous cholecystitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of all ages and sex admitted in the emergency department for acute cholecystitis,&#xD;
      aged &gt;=18 yo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged&lt; 18 yo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2020/10/01 to 2021/05/31&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All epidemiological, clinical, and surgical data will be collected in an online case report&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prevalence study and univariate and multivariate analysis of each scheduled&#xD;
      parameter will be carried out. In the statistical analysis, the investigators will&#xD;
      differentiate the data also by gender. All patients having cholecystitis including those&#xD;
      having gangrenous cholecystitis will be included in the analysis. Previous World Society of&#xD;
      Emergency Surgery prospective studies on sepsis (Sartelli et al, WJES, 2019; 14: 34; Sartelli&#xD;
      et al, 2015; 10: 61) showed that this is feasible and the investigators' aim is getting&#xD;
      exactly the number of patients of these two studies. It is expected that the COVID-19&#xD;
      patients will be less than the negative ones for two reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the incidence of COVID-19 infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. trial to treat them conservatively often outside the hospitals. Non-parametric methods&#xD;
           will be used in case of a small number of COVID-19 patients which work even if the&#xD;
           groups are less than 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study, it will not attempt to change or modify the clinical practice&#xD;
      of the participating physicians. The study will meet and conform to the standards outlined in&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Epidemiological Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every clinical center attending the study is responsible for Ethics Committee approval. Every&#xD;
      local investigator is responsible for data collection and data entry. All surgeons involved&#xD;
      in the patients' recruitment will be included in the research authorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every clinical center involved in the study will be identified by a number assigned before&#xD;
      starting to enter data. A link to an anonymous online case report form will be sent by mail&#xD;
      to collaborators, to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will not attempt to change or modify the laboratory or clinical&#xD;
      practices of the participating physicians, consequently, informed consent will not be&#xD;
      required. Every patient included in this study will be asked to sign a written consent to&#xD;
      authorize the anonymous treatment of personal data if it is not already provided at the&#xD;
      admission in the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every investigator is responsible for entering data on one online case report form for every&#xD;
      patient included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be carried out with the supervision of Prof.Fikri Abu-Zidan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes of the Study To demonstrate the correlation between necrotic cholecystitis&#xD;
      and predisposition to thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients. To identify high-risk patients&#xD;
      for developing necrotic cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results and Publication Policy The outcomes of this study will be analyzed&#xD;
      and published in a scientific journal with an IF.&#xD;
