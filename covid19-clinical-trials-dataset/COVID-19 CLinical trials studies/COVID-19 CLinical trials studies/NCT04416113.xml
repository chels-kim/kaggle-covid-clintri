  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until now there is no vaccine or reliable treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic. The&#xD;
      fundamental mechanisms of non-invasive low-level laser in photobiomodulation (PBM) and&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy is to stimulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain where a transient&#xD;
      release of non-cytotoxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) will lead to positive&#xD;
      modulation of the immune response. As previous studies mentioned that the most important&#xD;
      strategy for COVID-19 management is oxygenation and faster rehabilitation of the damaged&#xD;
      tissue, antiviral effects, and, ﬁnally, reduction or controlling the cytokine storm by&#xD;
      reducing inﬂammatory agents. PBM may be used as adjuvant therapy or even an alternative&#xD;
      therapy in all these mechanisms without side effects and drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The objective of this clinical trial is to use the photobiomodulation therapy&#xD;
      (PBMT), and photodynamic therapy as adjuvant therapy or even an alternative therapy for&#xD;
      Covide-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods A randomized controlled study will be conducted on 60 patients of&#xD;
      positive COVID 19. The patients will be divided into 3 equal groups. Group, I will receive a&#xD;
      low-level laser (diode laser 980nm) from laser watch for 30 minutes, 20 J for 3 to 5 days,&#xD;
      and laser acupuncture. Group 2 will be treated with photodynamic therapy by injecting the&#xD;
      methylene blue as a photosensitizer and irradiated with laser watch (diode laser 670 nm).&#xD;
      Group 3 will serve as a control. Evaluation methods will include laboratory investigations&#xD;
      and CT chest.&#xD;

      Treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study was conducted following the approval of the research ethics committee for&#xD;
      experimental and clinical studies at the National Institute of Laser Enhanced Sciences, Cairo&#xD;
      University, Egypt (approval number CU-NILES/16/20 May 2020) with the principles outlined in&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki for human subject experimentation being followed. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the patients, and the privacy rights will be continuously&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on 60 patients with COVID 19 of all ages and both sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: photobiomodulation This group included the use of laser watch and laser acupuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser watch Patients will be subjected to low level laser (diode laser 980nm) for 30 minutes,&#xD;
      the recommended dose based on previous study is 20 J for 3 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser watched applied at the wrist on the radial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser acupuncture Patients will receive laser acupuncture using pulsed infra- red laser,&#xD;
      wavelength 880 / 905/980 nm, spot size diameter of 5 mm frequency 2500 Hz, average power 15&#xD;
      W, energy of 225 mJ applied for 2 min per point and pulse width of 100 ns and area = 0.2 cm2.&#xD;
      Patients will receive one session daily for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser acupuncture was applied at the following points (World Health Organization 2008). The&#xD;
      points where the laser acupuncture will be applied are demonstrated in the following figures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For cough and chest tightness, wheezes and congestion: LU1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 14 (fig.1) For&#xD;
           improving immunity and blood circulation, also for dyspnea and GIT manifestation also,&#xD;
           breaks up blood stagnation in the chest: ST36&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affects the throat, chest, lungs: CV12, CV4 Sore throat, coughing, &amp; asthma: KI3 Fig&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser acupuncture device could be applied simultaneously on all points same time by&#xD;
           special multi-channel device (fig3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (photodynamic therapy) Methylene blue injection USP 1% will be used as a&#xD;
      photosensitizer in PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0.1 to 0.2 mL of 1% solution per kilogram of body weight Methylene Blue (methylene blue&#xD;
           injection) will be injected intravenously very slowly over a period of several minutes&#xD;
           to prevent local high concentration of the compound from producing methemoglobin (low&#xD;
           concentrations will convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin and will be activated by light).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After one hour apply Light dose: 100 - 200 J/cm2 50-100 mW/cm2. (50 mW/cm2 increased the&#xD;
           phototoxic response as well as fractionated light application).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session will be done twice per week&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser watched applied at the wrist on the radial artery. Group 3: positive control This group&#xD;
      will include patients who are subjected to conventional treatment Evaluation and assessment&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to thorough examination with complete personal and clinical&#xD;
      history and will do the following before and after treatment: PCR, CBC, CRP, ESR, D dimers,&#xD;
      liver enzymes, and Ferritin, CT chest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Treatment will be stopped if no improvement occurred after one week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical calculations were done using computer programs SPSS (Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) v.16 for Microsoft Windows. Continuous variables&#xD;
      were tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Values are presented as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation, or in the case of non-normally distributed data as median and&#xD;
      inter-quartile range. For comparison between paired parameters (before and after treatment),&#xD;
      paired t-test or the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test were used according to data&#xD;
      normality. For comparison between independent groups, the chi-squared test was used to&#xD;
      compare percentages between different groups of patients. Normally distributed data were&#xD;
      analyzed using independent samples t-test. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney U-test. p values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
