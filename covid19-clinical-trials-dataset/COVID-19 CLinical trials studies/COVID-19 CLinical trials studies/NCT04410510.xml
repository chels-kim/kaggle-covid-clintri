      Antioxidants, and particularly polyphenols, have shown protection in respiratory pathologies,&#xD;
      which is related to the decrease in the severity of the clinical picture and suppression of&#xD;
      inflammation. This suppression of inflammation may be related to the inhibition of NF-kB&#xD;
      polyphenols, where its activation is related to the stimulation of 150 stimuli including&#xD;
      cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, THF-α, GM-CSF, MCP-1), TLRs, among others. There may be other&#xD;
      additional mechanisms that can help control virus-induced respiratory pathologies, among&#xD;
      which are the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with tissue destruction&#xD;
      caused by the virus and a selective antiviral action can be reported. direct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized P2Et extract obtained from C. spinosa, by the Immunobiology Group of the&#xD;
      Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, is highly antioxidant, decreases lipid peroxidation and&#xD;
      tissue damage and induces complete autophagy in stressed or tumor cells. The induction of a&#xD;
      full autophagic flow could inhibit the replication of beta-coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
      Furthermore, P2Et can decrease the factors involved in tissue damage by reducing IL-6 and&#xD;
      decrease ILC2 cells of the lung in animals with lung metastases (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These antecedents suggest that the supplementation of patients with COVID-19 with the extract&#xD;
      P2Et, could improve their general condition and decrease the inflammatory mediators and the&#xD;
      viral load.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phytomedicines have been used in multiple pathologies such as cancer, diabetes, HIV and&#xD;
      respiratory pathologies, in which the inflammatory component is characterized. The extracts&#xD;
      of these phytomedicines have a high antioxidant capacity related to the fact that their&#xD;
      constituents are compounds of the polyphenol type, and this antioxidant mechanism has been&#xD;
      related in part to the antiviral action they present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly, in respiratory pathologies such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Covid-19, an&#xD;
      important inflammatory component is observed. Patients infected with COVID-19 have high&#xD;
      amounts of IL1-, IFN-γ, IP-10, and MCP-1, which are likely to trigger the Th1 cellular&#xD;
      response. Furthermore, patients requiring ICU admission have higher concentrations of G-CSF,&#xD;
      IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1-, and TNF-α, suggesting that cytokine storm is associated with the&#xD;
      severity of the clinical picture.&#xD;
