  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase I clinical study of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending doses of XC7 after single and multiple&#xD;
      oral administration in healthy volunteers. It's planned to include sequentially 2 cohorts of&#xD;
      4 volunteers who will receive a single dose of XC7 (100 mg and 200 mg) or placebo (cohort&#xD;
      ratio 3:1) and 1 cohort of 8 volunteers who will receive multiple doses of the XC7 (200 mg)&#xD;
      or placebo during 14 days (cohort ratio 6:2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 1 centre. The study will consist of 3 periods: screening (7&#xD;
      days), treatment (1 or 14 days) and follow-up (7 or 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers of single dosing cohorts will receive the investigated drug (ID) ХС7 or&#xD;
      placebo once and stay at the study center for at least 24 hours after the ID administration&#xD;
      to monitor the safety parameters and for sampling for PK analysis. The Follow-up will last 7&#xD;
      days, during which safety parameters and PK in volunteers will be studied. Based on all&#xD;
      safety data from the XC7 100 mg cohort, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will&#xD;
      consider dose increase and entry of the 200 mg cohort. If the single dose of ХС7 200 mg is&#xD;
      considered to be safe, the third multiple dosing cohort of 200 mg will be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers from multiple dosing cohort will receive the ID (ХС7 or placebo) once a day&#xD;
      during 14 days and will stay at the hospital (study center) during the first five days after&#xD;
      administration of the ID. The Follow-up will last 14 days, during which they will study&#xD;
      safety parameters and PK in volunteers.&#xD;
