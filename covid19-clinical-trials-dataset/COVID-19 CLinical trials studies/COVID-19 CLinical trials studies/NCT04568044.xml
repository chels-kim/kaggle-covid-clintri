    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to investigate if and how pregnant women infected with&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) infection go on to develop long-term immunity. In December&#xD;
      2019, a group of people in Wuhan, China presented with symptoms of a pneumonia of an unknown&#xD;
      cause that led to the discovery of a new coronavirus called COVID-19. COVID-19 has caused a&#xD;
      global pandemic with 7,140,000 confirmed cases and 418,000 deaths as of 13th June 2020. In&#xD;
      the United Kingdom (UK), there have been 294,000 cases and 41,662 deaths as of 13th June&#xD;
      2020. In humans, this infection primarily involves the upper part of the lungs, but it can&#xD;
      also affect other organs. It causes mild symptoms in the majority of people affected but some&#xD;
      people can have severe infections, with some even requiring critical care in hospital. During&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a previous coronavirus epidemic, pregnant women&#xD;
      were disproportionately affected with severe illness. Understanding how the immune system&#xD;
      responds long-term to this infection may hold the key to developing better vaccines and&#xD;
      efficient treatment plans. Specialised immunity develops when individuals are infected by&#xD;
      this and other viruses. The investigators of this study propose that, in pregnancy, this&#xD;
      specialised immunity may not behave effectively. This may affect their ability to develop&#xD;
      long lasting immunity and make them more vulnerable to re-infection. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to recruit patients across 6 groups including COVID-19 newly infected&#xD;
      pregnant women, and people with differing illness severity, mild to moderate,&#xD;
      severe/critical, no infection (controls), as well as pregnant women with influenza and those&#xD;
      receiving influenza vaccine. The study team will compare COVID-19 in pregnancy with&#xD;
      non-pregnant infected and with influenza infected and vaccinated pregnant women. The study&#xD;
      team will consent patients in all of these groups to provide a series of blood samples at&#xD;
      different time points in a 12-month period.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly known as Coronavirus&#xD;
      Disease-19 (COVID-19), is a global pandemic with 7,410,000 confirmed cases and 418,000 deaths&#xD;
      as of 13th June 2020. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% of its sequence identity&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV and resembles some clinical outcomes like viral pneumonia. However, it causes&#xD;
      milder symptoms in majority of people infected, and can be an asymptomatic infection in some&#xD;
      individuals. Just in the 21st century, we have seen three major coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks:&#xD;
      SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the novel SARS-CoV-2, which have&#xD;
      resulted in many deaths and have posed a real threat to public health. In fact, during SARS&#xD;
      more pregnant women required intensive care and ventilation, and the number of deaths was&#xD;
      higher when compared to non-pregnant adults. This is partly because in pregnancy, the risk of&#xD;
      viral pneumonia is greater compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding T and B cell mediated immunity in COVID-19 participants may hold the key to&#xD;
      developing better vaccines and efficient treatment plans. To date there is only one study&#xD;
      that has investigated circulatory T follicular helper cells (cTFH), which like there germinal&#xD;
      centre counterparts are a specialised effector cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cell that&#xD;
      induces B cell activation, and differentiation into class-switched and antibody secreting&#xD;
      long-lasting plasmablasts. This study observed an increase in cTFH during pregnancy. However,&#xD;
      studies in older patients, which comprise another high risk group, have shown mixed results&#xD;
      with cTFH showing lower levels of activation. This will impact on long term antibody&#xD;
      production following infection or vaccination. We propose that circulatory cTFH, and B cells&#xD;
      may not be as activated in both pregnant women and patients with severe to critical patients&#xD;
      when compared with mild to moderate patients resulting in less or poorly functioning&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Therefore, we expect in infected pregnant individuals the&#xD;
      development of long-term immunity may be worse when compared to non-pregnant people with&#xD;
      similar disease severity, making them more susceptible to re-infection. Compared to&#xD;
      influenza, which is another respiratory illness with significant morbidity in pregnancy and&#xD;
      has a current vaccination program, we expect that the same measures of immunity will be less&#xD;
      pronounced post COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the development of long-term immunity will&#xD;
      be less effective in patients with severe illness, who for the most part, comprise a&#xD;
      particularly high-risk group including the elderly and patients with multiple comorbidities.&#xD;
      It is vital that we expand our knowledge of long-lasting immunity in individuals who have&#xD;
      recovered from COVID-19 to see how long these individuals are protected against re-infection&#xD;
      and whether they develop long lasting immunity. Moreover, there is no current research&#xD;
      establishing the parameters of seroprotective immunity. Previous research has suggested that&#xD;
      SARS-CoV specific Immunoglobin G (IgG) declines significantly within 2 years with some&#xD;
      reports showing a complete loss within 6 years in most SARS-CoV recovered patients. This may&#xD;
      equate to a loss of long-term protection. The investigators of this study propose measuring&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG levels by doing memory B cell (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot) ELISpots and&#xD;
      comparing the data with cTFH and B cell flow cytometry panels. The research team will be able&#xD;
      to profile the generation and persistence of protective antibodies produced by infected&#xD;
      individuals who go on to recover. The findings from this study will generate hypotheses to be&#xD;
      tested in larger studies of COVID-19 recovered pregnant patients, and also assist researchers&#xD;
      working trying to understand the effectiveness of the vaccines in pregnancy once these become&#xD;
      commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pregnant individuals who have recovered from COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. How long will their SARS-CoV-2 specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels remain in peripheral&#xD;
      blood, what is the rate of decline and how does this compare to non-pregnant individuals?&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. How did their T cell mediated immune function differ from non-pregnant patients during the&#xD;
      infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. How do their SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cell differ when compared to severe to&#xD;
      non-pregnant patients' post-recovery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. How does antibody production, and B and T cell function post COVID-19 infection in&#xD;
      pregnancy compare with influenza infection and vaccination?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that pregnant patients with COVID-19 will develop a less robust&#xD;
      and measurable B-cell response when compared to influenza infected/vaccinated women and&#xD;
      non-pregnant individuals, and that their seroprotective antibody responses will decline by 12&#xD;
      months post infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Establish robust assays to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG from individuals who have&#xD;
      recovered from COVID-19 infection and track these levels over a 12-month period to measure&#xD;
      any decline. In pregnancy, compare this to influenza antibodies produced after infection and&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Measure frequency of activated cTFH, and antigen-secreting cells (ASCs) at days 7-14 of&#xD;
      symptom onset in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and compare with non-pregnant groups, and&#xD;
      pregnant influenza infected and influenza vaccinated. In addition, compare between&#xD;
      non-pregnant groups with mild to moderate symptoms when compared to severe to critical&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Measure frequency of activated memory B cells at day 28 in pregnant patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      and compare with non-pregnant groups, and pregnant influenza infected and influenza&#xD;
      vaccinated. In addition, compare between non-pregnant groups with mild to moderate symptoms&#xD;
      when compared to severe to critical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Measure frequency of CD4 and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells in pregnant&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 and compare with non-pregnant groups, and pregnant influenza infected&#xD;
      and influenza vaccinated. In addition, compare between non-pregnant groups with mild to&#xD;
      moderate symptoms when compared to severe to critical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Quantify antigen-specific memory T cells and measure frequency of activated T cells in all&#xD;
      patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from infected participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective observational project to investigate the potential decline&#xD;
      of protective immunity in pregnancy after participants have recovered from SARS-CoV-2. The&#xD;
      research team will compare these findings with non-pregnant patients who have had COVID-19&#xD;
      and developed mild to moderate symptoms or severe to critical participants. Patients who go&#xD;
      on to join a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trial will not be excluded but the vaccination date will be&#xD;
      recorded, and their results interpreted accordingly. In order to compare COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      with another respiratory infection and assess long term protective immunity with an&#xD;
      intervention already in place in this patient group designed to provide seroprotective&#xD;
      antibodies, the investigators will investigate influenza and influenza vaccine. Therefore,&#xD;
      data from pregnant patients will also be compared with influenza infected pregnant women and&#xD;
      those who have received the influenza vaccination.&#xD;

        16 patients per group will be required. In the COVID-19 infected, non-pregnant groups, the&#xD;
        study team will be recruiting both male and female participants who would have been healthy&#xD;
        prior to contracting SARS-CoV-2. Once all the samples have been collected, the&#xD;
        investigators may stratify them based on gender, BMI, and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Of note, in pregnant and postnatal women with COVID-19, the research team expect small&#xD;
        numbers of recruits and currently the overall number of COVID-19 patients in London is on&#xD;
        the decline. Therefore, the investigators will invite participants who were diagnosed up to&#xD;
        the preceding 8 months to participate and have blood samples taken from the nearest&#xD;
        time-point to the interval from their symptom onset and then continue with the sample&#xD;
