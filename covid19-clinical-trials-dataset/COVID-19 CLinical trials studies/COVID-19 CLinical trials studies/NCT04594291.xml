  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study that will aim to recruit 60 participants who&#xD;
      have had COVID-19, were admitted to hospital, required intensive care, and/or developed AKI&#xD;
      during their hospital stay. Potential participants will be approached either by telephone by&#xD;
      a member of the research team or via clinics (nephrology, post-ICU follow up clinics).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the participants have read and understand the Participant Information Sheet, and had&#xD;
      sufficient time (at least 24 hours) to consider their participation in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will ask them to sign a consent form, which shows their willingness to take&#xD;
      part. The investigators will then collect information from their medical records about their&#xD;
      hospital admission with COVID-19, including their age, ethnicity, medical conditions, length&#xD;
      of hospital stay, tablets or any other treatments they received, as well as details of their&#xD;
      stay in the ICU. The investigators will also arrange their first study visit which should be&#xD;
      3-6 months after they had been discharged from the hospital. During this first study day, the&#xD;
      investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure weight and height and take blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask participants to complete three questionnaires about their health, symptoms of&#xD;
           fatigue and quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D-5L and Fatigue Questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the accumulation of toxins in the skin using a safe, quick (less than five&#xD;
           minutes) and painless technique called skin autofluorescence. This involves placing the&#xD;
           forearm on a piece of equipment that shines a light on the skin and measures the amount&#xD;
           of light that is reflected back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct an MRI scan of the kidneys, muscles, abdomen and heart. The MRI scan will take&#xD;
           60-70 minutes in total. The investigators will ask participants not to eat or drink&#xD;
           anything two hours before the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this visit, the investigators will ask participants to come back for two more study&#xD;
      visits, which will be arranged at 12 and 24 months after their hospital discharge. These&#xD;
      visits will consist of the same procedures and measurements done in the first study visit.&#xD;

    <measure>MRI assessment of global organ structure at 12 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Global organ structure will be assessed through structural T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans which will provide information about automated segmentation and volume assessment of whole kidney (and both cortex and medulla) as well as other abdominal organs (including liver and spleen). Global organ structure will also be assessed through longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation time mapping. T1 and T2 increase with tissue inflammation, oedema and fibrosis. A respiratory-triggered inversion recovery (IR) spin-echo echo-planar scheme will be used for abdominal T1 mapping and a Gradient and spin echo (T2-GraSE) scheme for abdominal T2 mapping.</description>

    <measure>MRI assessment of thrombi (R2*) at 12 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>R2* data will be acquired using a multi-echo fast field echo (mFFE) scheme to assess thrombi. Conventionally R2* mapping is used as a measure of oxygenation, but R2*is likely to be altered by other factors in COVID-19, including oedema and small vessel thrombotic processes.</description>
