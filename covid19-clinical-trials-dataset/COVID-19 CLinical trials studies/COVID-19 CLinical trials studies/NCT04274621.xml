  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia(NCIP) in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China, has attracted global attention because of its strong transmission ability and certain&#xD;
      fatality. Analyzing the clinical data of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection, the&#xD;
      current studies found that fever, fatigue and dry cough were common symptoms, and 43.8% of&#xD;
      the patients showed fever before admission. Some scholars emphasize that the most effective&#xD;
      means to control the outbreak are early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and early&#xD;
      treatment. In the face of the pressure that a large number of people need rapid screening and&#xD;
      the deficiency that the forehead temperature measurement is easily affected by the&#xD;
      environment, the investigators would like to explore the accuracy and advantages of wrist&#xD;
      temperature measurement in different environments and conditions in this period. And&#xD;
      determine the thresholds of non-contact infrared thermometer for the screening of patients&#xD;
      with fever, in order to provide clinical indicators for further detection of patients with&#xD;
      suspected fever.&#xD;
