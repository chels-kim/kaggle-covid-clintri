      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of&#xD;
      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome&#xD;
      information of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from these pneumonia patients and developed a&#xD;
      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the availability of remdesvir as a&#xD;
      potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections,&#xD;
      this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of&#xD;
      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome&#xD;
      information of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from these pneumonia patients and developed a&#xD;
      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated&#xD;
      with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that&#xD;
      person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of COVID-19 identified&#xD;
      in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in&#xD;
      multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion&#xD;
      phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring,&#xD;
      and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in&#xD;
      human populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a&#xD;
      mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and&#xD;
      even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and&#xD;
      may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has&#xD;
      resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from&#xD;
      prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring&#xD;
      supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur&#xD;
      most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA&#xD;
      detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for&#xD;
      therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk&#xD;
      of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive&#xD;
      care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the&#xD;
      duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were COVID-19 to become pandemic&#xD;
      and/or endemic in human populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the availability of remdesvir as a&#xD;
      potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections,&#xD;
      this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate COVID-19.&#xD;
