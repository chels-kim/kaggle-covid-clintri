&#xD;
      B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure.&#xD;
      Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an&#xD;
      ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis,&#xD;
      B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In&#xD;
      vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin&#xD;
      1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed&#xD;
      angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover,&#xD;
      B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis,&#xD;
      and cardiac dysfunction in mice. A study demonestrated that the bacterial B38-CAP as an&#xD;
      ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase&#xD;
      to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved&#xD;
      protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure. On the other hand, Treatment with&#xD;
      recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus&#xD;
      soluble, has been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models&#xD;
      including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth. rhACE2 is&#xD;
      currently tested in the clinic to treat ARDS and COVID-19 infected patients . Using cell&#xD;
      cultures and organoids, researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the&#xD;
      University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, showed that by adding a genetically modified&#xD;
      variant of ACE2, called human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hrsACE2),&#xD;
      COVID-19 was prevented from entering cells.The paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2&#xD;
      had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a&#xD;
      factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a&#xD;
      glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein&#xD;
      expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug&#xD;
      development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is&#xD;
      associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this&#xD;
      was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the&#xD;
      serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks.B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli&#xD;
      expression system and is cost effective. with therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse&#xD;
      heart failure model. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly&#xD;
      suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate.&#xD;
      These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the&#xD;
      principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with cloned Bacterial ACE2&#xD;
      receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury&#xD;
      preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure&#xD;
      the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus&#xD;
      from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of&#xD;
      the virus in the lungs and other organs. A study showed that recombinant B38-CAP protein&#xD;
      downregulates Ang II levels in mice and antagonizes Ang II-induced hypertension, pathological&#xD;
      cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis. We also show beneficial effects of B38-CAP on&#xD;
      the pathology of pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt&#xD;
      toxicities.Finally the principal investigator expect that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme in&#xD;
      bacteria B38-CAP may be do the same mechanism of rhACE2 in inhibiting COVID -19 and the other&#xD;
      suggested mechanism is that injection of ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP in human body&#xD;
      may down regulate human ACE2 which is the real receptor of COVID -19 and in the same time it&#xD;
      will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because there seems a difference in substrate&#xD;
      specificity between two enzymes.&#xD;

      While the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading across the world, infecting more than one&#xD;
      million people, the fact that no specific drug or vaccine exists against any of the&#xD;
      coronaviruses including the SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus is creating fear among the&#xD;
      people. world's COVID-19 count rises sharply day by day (active cases count more than one&#xD;
      million people . Hydroxychloroquine is the only ray of hope now-a-days, along with different&#xD;
      vaccine trials and passive immunisation therapy using 'convalescent plasma', target-specific&#xD;
      drug discovery is of paramount importance right now.It has been well-known that SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      appears to be optimized for binding to the human receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      2). The spike (S) glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S.&#xD;
      Wrapp et al., (2020) also tested several published SARS-CoV RBD (receptor binding&#xD;
      domain)-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to&#xD;
      2019-nCoV S. ACE2 is expressed in a variety of different tissues including both the upper and&#xD;
      lower respiratory tract, myocardium and the gastrointestinal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      hrsACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers used blood vessel and kidney organoids to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can&#xD;
      directly infect and multiply within these tissues, a possible cause of the multi-organ&#xD;
      failures and cardiovascular damage seen in severe COVID-19 cases. The addition of hrsACE2&#xD;
      also reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these organoids. the paper, published in Cell, shows&#xD;
      that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce&#xD;
      it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Said Ali Mirazimi, adjunct professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Karolinska&#xD;
      Institutet and one of the study's corresponding authors. &quot;We believe adding this enzyme copy,&#xD;
      hrsACE2, lures the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It&#xD;
      distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.&quot; But treating with&#xD;
      according to Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19&#xD;
      infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 as rhACE2 is a&#xD;
      glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein&#xD;
      expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug&#xD;
      development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is&#xD;
      associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this&#xD;
      was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the&#xD;
      serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic&#xD;
      mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice without&#xD;
      affecting the heart rate. These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor&#xD;
      effect of Ang II. So the principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with&#xD;
      Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19&#xD;
      infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to&#xD;
      brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells…&#xD;
      It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.&#xD;

      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants&#xD;
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It&#xD;
      is not expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The&#xD;
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine&#xD;
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of&#xD;
      active drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving at least one dose&#xD;
      of active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24 subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to&#xD;
      have at least 12 evaluable patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: 0.4 mg/kg rbACE2 IV BID and standard of care Control group: standard of&#xD;
      care Intervention duration: up to 7 days of therapy No planned interim analysis.&#xD;
