    <textblock>
      Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a new corona virus called Severe Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, the WHO Director-General&#xD;
      declared COVID-19 a pandemic1. The first outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China. 2,3 COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has severely affected global health services.4 It is important not to overlook the&#xD;
      value of some public health preventive interventions which cannot be postponed, such as&#xD;
      vaccinations.5 As reported by WHO, the disruption of immunization services, even for brief&#xD;
      periods, will result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals, raising the risks of an&#xD;
      upsurge in outbreak-prone VPDs.6 The reduction of vaccination coverage could cause an&#xD;
      increase in morbidity and mortality among children. Consequently, a greater burden could be&#xD;
      placed on health systems. Examples from previous large epidemics (e.g. diphtheria in the&#xD;
      former Soviet Union in 1990-1996 and in Venezuela in 2017-2018) show that, when vaccination&#xD;
      coverage falls or vaccinations are disrupted, cases of infectious diseases that have&#xD;
      disappeared can quickly re-emerge.7-8 Egypt declared a national state of emergency to control&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic and implemented a stay-at-home order. Such strategies might result in&#xD;
      decreased accessibility to routine immunization services, leaving children at risk for&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable diseases and their complications.9 Great efforts are needed for rapid&#xD;
      catch-up of children not up-to-date with routine vaccines. Parental concerns about&#xD;
      potentially exposing their children to COVID-19 during vaccination visits might contribute to&#xD;
      incompalince.10 Reminding parents of the vital need to protect their children against serious&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable diseases is critical.&#xD;
