  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect patients' experiences and feedback to better&#xD;
      understand and improve mental health care using telehealth services. This is critically&#xD;
      important as telehealth appointments, including both phone and video calls, continue to be&#xD;
      offered for regular appointments to reduce in-person interaction as a preventive measure to&#xD;
      help control the spread of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying patients' perceived benefits and challenges of using telehealth services for mental&#xD;
      health care will allow us to prioritize improvements to the telehealth experience and&#xD;
      potentially, patient adoption of and comfort with remote appointments. This study's results&#xD;
      would also inform policy makers and insurance companies about the potential utility of&#xD;
      delivering mental health care through telehealth, even beyond the duration of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
