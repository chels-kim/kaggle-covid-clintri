  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to deliver an intervention to promote nurse leadership and decision-making in the&#xD;
      hospital setting, by providing them with training for maintaining minimum service delivery&#xD;
      standards for hospital infection control with respect to COVID-19; but also other infectious&#xD;
      disease burden management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nurses are frontline practitioners in the fight against COVID-19. Empowering nurses through&#xD;
      training for infection prevention for COVID-19 is an essential step to facilitate nurse&#xD;
      leadership and safety in the hospital. There is immense reliance on nurses with regard to&#xD;
      patient safety, yet very little effort is made to invest in interventions for their&#xD;
      leadership roles in developing countries, including Pakistan. In this study the aim is to&#xD;
      deliver an intervention for COVID-19 preventive protocols to nurses and assess the impact of&#xD;
      the intervention through a pre and post-test survey. A total of 200 nurses will be sampled. A&#xD;
      100 nurses each will be part of the control and experiment group each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed using SPSS. Pre and post test results will be presented using&#xD;
      descriptive data and bivariate regression will be used to present higher odds of confidence&#xD;
      in preventive and awareness literacy for COVID-19 in nurses after intervention delivery.&#xD;
      Through this research the aim is to improve nurse leadership in maintaining minimum service&#xD;
      delivery standards for hospital infection control with respect to COVID-19; but also other&#xD;
      infectious disease burden management.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will consist of 44 questions for core competencies of infection control and prevention, including 10 constructs of: (1) Identification of infectious disease processes, (2) Surveillance and epidemiologic investigations, (3) Preventing/controlling the transmission of infectious agents, (4) Employee/occupational health, (5) Management and communication planning, (6) Quality/performance improvement and patient safety, and (7) Education and research education, (8) Confidence with training and awareness for identification and implementation for COVID-19 prevention and control strategies, (9) confidence in training and awareness, and (10) satisfaction with workplace support. It is a five-point Likert-type scale (strongly agree - agree - neutral - disagree - strongly disagree). The highest value of the scale is 6 and the lowest value is 1; with 6 points showing strong agreement with the item statement (E.g. Q1. Can you differentiate between other infections and COVID-19).</description>
