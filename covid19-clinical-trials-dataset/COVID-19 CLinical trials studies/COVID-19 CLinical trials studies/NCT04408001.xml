  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a pathology linked to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a new virus of the coronaviridae&#xD;
      family that emerged in China in December 2019 before rapidly becoming a pandemic according to&#xD;
      the WHO on March 11, 2020. The epidemic affected France from February 2020. On February 24, a&#xD;
      patient hospitalized at Percy hospital was the cause of a major nosocomial epidemic,&#xD;
      potentially responsible for more than 250 symptomatic people in the hospital as of April 6.&#xD;
      The outbreak was identified by Percy hospital management on March 16, and barrier measures&#xD;
      were immediately put in place. From March 20, a mixed investigation unit set up a chain of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs for Percy hospital staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A COVID-19 case reporting unit was set up at Percy hospital in response to the identification&#xD;
      of the outbreak within the hospital. This unit carried out rapid identification and regular&#xD;
      follow-up until the return to work of the staff. Thus all symptomatic patients are identified&#xD;
      and the COVID-19 case census cell will follow all Percy hospital staff, including volunteers&#xD;
      recruited to deal with the epidemic, throughout the duration of the epidemic. This&#xD;
      population, captive by nature, will be one of the few described in the world during this&#xD;
      epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current data on short-, medium- and long-term immunity induced by COVID-19 infection are&#xD;
      fragmentary, as is the existence of a large asymptomatic population, making it difficult to&#xD;
      cut the chains of transmission in the absence of an effective diagnostic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important issue is the quality of immunity induced by the infection, as it conditions&#xD;
      the future of the pandemic, which could become endemic and recurrent if immunity were not&#xD;
      sterilizing. As yet unpublished data in primates show that in the primate model re-infection&#xD;
      is not possible in the short term, while patients cured from the Wuhan epidemic seem to be&#xD;
      detected again positive for virus shedding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to characterize the immunity (systemic and local) induced by&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 infection among Percy hospital staff who are at high risk of contamination even in&#xD;
      a period of confinement.&#xD;
