  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the current COVID-19 Pandemic, all communities are relying heavily on medical&#xD;
      personnel and first-responders to maintain high levels of psychological and occupational&#xD;
      functioning. However, during times of persistent high levels of stress, many individuals&#xD;
      experience depletion in psychological resources, suffering intense distress that can make&#xD;
      daily occupational and interpersonal functioning difficult. In order to assist with this&#xD;
      immense challenge, this research team has developed a brief daily intervention based on&#xD;
      decades of stress and trauma research that may help to support psychological health in&#xD;
      individuals on the frontlines who are most essential to society. Considerable evidence&#xD;
      supports the role of attention to and conceptualization of emotional experience in&#xD;
      psychological resilience. This project tests a highly innovative combination of interventions&#xD;
      targeting these processes in a brief, daily activity. The primary project aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the Daily Coping Toolkit for medical personnel and first responders to determine&#xD;
      efficacy over time, to test relative dosing, and to explicate the underlying therapeutic&#xD;
      processes. The toolkit consists of 3 activities, administered one time each day, taking&#xD;
      minutes to complete and will be administered to n=1000 personnel. Data analysis will test the&#xD;
      impact of the toolkit on momentary affective processes and on symptoms and wellbeing over 9&#xD;
      months. The impact of this research will be evidence to support the further use of this novel&#xD;
      tool to assist essential front-line personnel during this ongoing crisis helping to mitigate&#xD;
      the psychological toll and also support occupational functioning now and in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During times of persistent high levels of stress, many individuals experience depletion in&#xD;
      psychological resources, suffering intense distress that can make daily occupational and&#xD;
      interpersonal functioning difficult. In order to assist during this exceptionally challenging&#xD;
      crisis, this research team has developed a brief daily intervention based on decades of&#xD;
      stress and trauma research that may help to support psychological health and coping resources&#xD;
      in individuals on the frontlines: medical personnel and first-responders. These are&#xD;
      individuals who are most essential to society in this difficult time. Although hospitals,&#xD;
      fire, and police departments have existing support resources in place, they are either based&#xD;
      on traditional models of treatment or consist of online peer-support or wellness&#xD;
      applications. All facets of existing support/interventions have considerable utility, but it&#xD;
      is not clear that these resources are designed to address the frequent and ongoing coping&#xD;
      demands of this crisis across a broad swath of individuals. In particular, traditional&#xD;
      psychotherapy models are unlikely to be successful due to very real time constraints of this&#xD;
      population at this time. Moreover, several decades of research would argue that traditional&#xD;
      psychotherapy is unlikely to be needed by most individuals, given prototypical patterns of&#xD;
      adjustment across a range of aversive events, including prior pandemics (SARS: Bonanno, et al&#xD;
      2008). However, even resilient individuals will struggle with distress and some symptoms.&#xD;
      Prior research has suggested that specific emotion processing patterns can support resilient&#xD;
      outcomes over the long-term and thus frontline workers may benefit from an intervention that&#xD;
      leverages this existing knowledge to facilitate adaptive emotion regulatory processing and&#xD;
      elevate well-being during this crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project aims to investigate a novel intervention: A Daily Coping Toolkit,&#xD;
      administered via online application, that consists of 3 activities targeting adaptive&#xD;
      emotional attention and expression, administered one time each day, only 4-10 minutes in&#xD;
      duration daily. The Toolkit is both practically feasible given the demands and current burden&#xD;
      on the target population as well as highly consistent with existing evidence. Moreover, the&#xD;
      Toolkit is not likely to conflict with other online tools or with traditional psychotherapy&#xD;
      and hence, can be practically applied across a broad swath of individuals in need. The&#xD;
      primary project aim is to test the Daily Coping Toolkit on a broader population of medical&#xD;
      personnel and first responders to determine efficacy over time, to test relative dosing, and&#xD;
      to explicate the underlying therapeutic processes. The potential impact of this research will&#xD;
      be evidence to support the further use of this novel tool to assist essential front-line&#xD;
      personnel during this ongoing crisis. This may assist with mitigating the psychological toll&#xD;
      of this crisis and also support the occupational functioning of medical personnel and first&#xD;
      responders, thus, contributing indirectly to improved patient outcomes. Finally, knowledge&#xD;
      gained from this research will support the further development of this tool to support&#xD;
      individuals facing future challenging events and circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: n=1000 medical personnel and first responders to test the efficacy of the Daily&#xD;
      Coping Toolkit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Interested individuals will go to www.tinyurl.com/dailycopingtoolkit for&#xD;
      additional information, including the informed consent. Once consent is provided, individuals&#xD;
      complete a brief assessment of current symptoms, well-being and psychiatric/treatment history&#xD;
      and then receive instructions to download the research application ExpiWell&#xD;
      (www.expiwell.com) a secure platform that operates on ios/Android devices upon which we&#xD;
      administer the Toolkit. Once downloaded, participants are randomized to a high versus low&#xD;
      treatment condition and will receive daily prompts to complete the intervention. After 7&#xD;
      days, they complete a brief assessment of symptoms, well-being, and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention and consent again for continuation in the research. Individuals can continue to&#xD;
      use the application without consenting further if they choose and their data will not be&#xD;
      accessible to researchers. For those that do consent, follow-up assessments occur at 2,6, and&#xD;
      9 months (symptoms and well-being).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Coping Toolkit Intervention: Participants are prompted one time daily (with 1-2&#xD;
      reminders) to complete the intervention which consists of the following three parts.&#xD;
      Randomization to high versus low condition is maintained for the first 7 days only in order&#xD;
      to test for relative dose effects (see #3 below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Emotion Labelling Activity: Participants rate 10 discrete negative and positive&#xD;
           emotional words on a likert scale (0-4). Precise labelling of emotional experience can&#xD;
           serve as a form of implicit emotion regulation and has been associated with healthy&#xD;
           psychophysiological and behavioral adaptation in a range of community and clinical&#xD;
           samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expressive Writing and Self Distancing Activity: Participants respond to an open-ended&#xD;
           prompt to write about their day in an open text box in response to the prompt: &quot;What was&#xD;
           today like...?&quot; After this is completed, they are prompted that if the experience was&#xD;
           very challenging, to revisit that experience in their mind by taking a &quot;fly on the wall&quot;&#xD;
           perspective (Kross &amp; Ayduk, 2016; see figure for instructions). Persistent evidence has&#xD;
           indicated that expressive writing is an effective coping tool. In addition, research has&#xD;
           identified the ways in which specific word use can facilitate healthy emotional&#xD;
           processing during stress. There is also significant research demonstrating that shifting&#xD;
           perspective about negative emotional experiences can facilitate a healthier distance&#xD;
           from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Positive Emotion Generation Activity (1 v. 2 prompts) Participants are prompted to take&#xD;
           a deep breath and then respond to 1 (or 2) of 8 possible prompts in which they can&#xD;
           generate positive emotions. In response to each, they are asked to describe their&#xD;
           thoughts or memories in open-ended text box. Note: For the first 7 days, participants&#xD;
           are randomized to either respond to one (low dose) or two (high dose) prompts so as to&#xD;
           test the relative efficacy of the &quot;dose&quot;. After 8 days, all participants default to the&#xD;
           higher dose of 2 prompts. Prompts are designed to elicit gratitude, positive social&#xD;
           experiences, amusing memories, kind acts they committed, satisfaction/pride with&#xD;
           accomplishments, positive future focus, and love for close others. Prior research has&#xD;
           demonstrated that positive emotions generated during highly stressful events predict&#xD;
           resilience and improved emotion regulation and coping. Moreover, positive emotion&#xD;
           generation has been shown broadly to predict increased psychological wellbeing.&#xD;
