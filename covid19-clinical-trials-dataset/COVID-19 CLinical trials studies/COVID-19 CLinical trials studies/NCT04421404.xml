  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study assess the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent&#xD;
      plasma in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory symptoms up to 14 days after the onset&#xD;
      of initial symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      convalescent fresh frozen plasma (frozen within 8 hours of collection) of PF24 (frozen within&#xD;
      24 hours) from blood donors who have recovered from COVID-19 containing antibodies to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 or control (standard fresh frozen plasma collected prior to 12/1/2019 or with&#xD;
      documented negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody). Should additional anti-COVID agents (anti-viral&#xD;
      and/or anti-inflammatory) become available for use as standard of care during implementation,&#xD;
      the sample size will be recalculated and increased to account for the estimated impact that&#xD;
      these agents may have on the reducing the progression to the primary endpoint of severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study investigators analyzing the data and participants will be blinded to the randomization. It may not be feasible to blind nursing staff to the treatment assignment to ensure proper ABO checking of the plasma unit at bedside per standard transfusion procedures, but every effort will be made to preserve blinding of the investigators, participant, and primary team providing care. An unblinded research assistant who is not involved in other aspects of the study will randomize the participant once enrolled. Randomization will be provided to an unblinded provider who is not part of the care team who will place the order for the plasma (CCP vs. control plasma) using a paper order that will not be part of the electronic medical record. The safety monitoring committee (SMC) will review study data, including unblinded data, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, study progress, and conduct of the study.</masking_description>

    <description>COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) is a form of passive antibody therapy that involves the administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating the infectious disease it causes. Convalescent plasma for this trial will be obtained from Vitalant (or American Red Cross if necessary). Patients identified as having recovered from COVID-19 will serve as potential donors. Potential donors will be screened using an anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay and antibody levels will be determined.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Contraindication to transfusion due to inability to tolerate additional fluid, such as&#xD;
             due to decompensated congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Baseline requirement for oxygen supplementation prior to COVID-19 infection or use of&#xD;
             positive pressure therapy for sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently experiencing severe hypoxemic failure, as defined in study endpoints&#xD;

        treatment that do not yet have data to support efficacy, such as IL-6 antagonists, these&#xD;
        medications must be stopped prior to enrollment. Receipt of current standard of care&#xD;
        COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir and dexamethasone is permitted and should be&#xD;
        recorded as a concomitant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Pregnancy is not exclusionary but will merit additional discussion of risks &amp;&#xD;
        benefits in the context of ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
