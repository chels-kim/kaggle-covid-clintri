    <textblock>
      Many agents have been given for treatment of COVID-19 infection. &quot;Covid-19 Diagnosis and&#xD;
      Treatment Guideline&quot; by Ministry of Health was advised nationwide use of favipiravir or&#xD;
      lopinavir-ritonavir although evidence was scarce for the nationwide use of&#xD;
      lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir to treat COVID-19 at the time of publication date of&#xD;
      detailed guideline Favipiravir is a RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor and approved for&#xD;
      treatment of influenza in Japan at 2014 The aim of the study was to compare ICU and hospital&#xD;
      mortality in patients with favipiravir or lopinavir-ritonavir treatment and compare other&#xD;
      laboratory parameters in patients treated with these two antiviral agents.&#xD;

    <description>Favipiravir was advised to all patients with severe pneumonia and progressing pneumonia findings or worsening clinical manifestations except pregnant, breast feeding, postpartum woman. PCR results were not waited to start favipiravir in this group of patients and continued if it would be negative but tomography findings were consistent with COVID-19. Loading dose was 1600 mg twice a day. Maintenance dose was 600 mg per 12 hours for four days.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Lopinavir-ritonavir therapy</arm_group_label>
    <description>Lopinavir-ritonavir therapy was used in selected ICU patients before widespread availability of favipiravir (23 March 2020) and/or if favipiravir was contraindicated. Combination of lopinavir 200 mg-ritonavir 50 mg tablet was the given form. It was given as double tablets twice daily for 10-14 days. Patients were accepted as under favipiravir therapy if they had incomplete course of lopinavir-ritonavir therapy (less than 5 days) and followed by favipiravir for 5 days.</description>
