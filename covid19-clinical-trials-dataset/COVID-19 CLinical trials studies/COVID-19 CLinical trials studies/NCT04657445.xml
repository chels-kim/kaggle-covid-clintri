  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational data and recording study. The aim of our study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of SARS-COV2 infection on patients' sense of smell and taste, through quality control&#xD;
      measurements using optic analogue scale (VAS) in hospitalized and in home-quarantined&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants who will be recruited in this research protocol will be adult patients&#xD;
      who are diagnosed positive for SARS-COV2, infection with Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
      Test (RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be divided in two groups. The first group will be consisted with&#xD;
      positive patients that were referred to either the Emergency Department (ED) of Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases or at the Outpatient Clinic screening for SARS-COV2 and are being self-quarantined&#xD;
      at home. The participants will be hospitalized patients in the Infectious Diseases Unit (IDU)&#xD;
      of the University General Hospital of Ioannina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will be performed at the moment of diagnosis both for self-quarantine&#xD;
      patients and for in hospitalized patients. The follow up evaluation will be a re-examination,&#xD;
      performed at least four weeks after the moment of diagnosis. The time internal of reassessing&#xD;
      the patients chosen according to current literature, estimated that is the minimum&#xD;
      reassessment interval and seems to be a reference time for either progression stabilization&#xD;
      or recession of the symptoms of anosmia/ ageusia (12, 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to evaluate their olfactory and gustatory abilities through the visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS), at three time points: 1.before infection( as they can recall it), 2. at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis and 3. four weeks later(14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' scoring will be recorded in a horizontal presentation of 100 VAS points, where zero&#xD;
      refers to no smell or taste while 100 refers to normal sensation. In addition, patients will&#xD;
      rate their nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea on a similar VAS scale, where 0 refers to a&#xD;
      completely blocked nose and an excessively runny nose while 100 indicates normal nasal&#xD;
      breathing and a no runny nose. All patients will assess the intensity of the olfactory and&#xD;
      taste function, through a self testing them at home. Patients will rate from 0 to 100 the&#xD;
      intensity of smell, after being exposed to five common household odors (ie lemon juice,&#xD;
      oregano, instant coffee, toothpaste and mint gum).The choice of these substances is based on&#xD;
      their influence at the irritation of the trigeminal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of taste function will be evaluated using four(4) substances: sugar, salt,&#xD;
      lemon juice and instant coffee (decaffeinated), that represent the following 4 basic quality&#xD;
      flavors:sweet, salty, sour and bitter. Every patient will have to receive orally half a&#xD;
      teaspoon of each testant and report the quality of taste perception. After each testant they&#xD;
      have to rinse their mouth with tap water. Bitter testant will have to be tested in the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics, associated symptoms, and comorbidities will be recorded. The patients&#xD;
      will have to report and fill in symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath or&#xD;
      dyspnea, fatigue, muscle aches, runny nose, blocked nose, loss of smell, and loss of taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be recorded in a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 positive patients recovering at home, will be informed for the study either by&#xD;
      telephone or in person, following all the safety measures provided by National Organization&#xD;
      of Public Health of Greece, by one of the investigators officially participating in the&#xD;
      study. A questionnaire will be completed by the examinee, after telephone information about&#xD;
      the purpose of the study and after providing a written consent from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospitalized patients in the Infectious Diseases Unit, will be informed by the&#xD;
      investigators participating in the study and will follow the above procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was submitted for approval to the research ethic committee and the scientific&#xD;
      council of University General Hospital of Ioannina and was accepted.&#xD;
