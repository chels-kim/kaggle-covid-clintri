      Administration of systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe forms of severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome(SARS-Co-2) infection are recommended by several guidelines. In the very&#xD;
      beginning of SARS-Co-2 pandemic the early recommendation by professional organization was&#xD;
      against routine use of corticosteroids for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), despite previous data and clinical practice for&#xD;
      patients with refractory or severe form of ARDS.&#xD;

      Administration of systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe forms of SARS-Co-2&#xD;
      infection are recommended by several guidelines. In the very beginning of SARS-Co-2 pandemic&#xD;
      the early recommendation by professional organization was against routine use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ARDS, despite previous&#xD;
      data and clinical practice for patients with refractory or severe form of ARDS. But at the&#xD;
      latest after publication of RECOVERY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy, July&#xD;
      2020) and ensued metaanalysis of World Health Organization (WHO) working group, the routine&#xD;
      administration of systemic corticosteroids was revisited. However, there are ongoing critical&#xD;
      debate of the evidence regarding the dose, administration, timing and type of corticosteroids&#xD;
      and ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) are challenging the recommendation of 6 mg of&#xD;
      dexamethasone for all patients with severe form of COVID-19. The dynamic of COVID-19 surges,&#xD;
      flip-flop of official recommendations within very short period of time and ongoing critical&#xD;
      debate could be with possible variations of daily clinical practice regarding using systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids. In an electronic evaluation form that will be send to European Society of&#xD;
      Intensive Care (ESICM) Members. The electronic survey will contain 10 question. In the&#xD;
      questionnaire the participants will have to describe their routine clinical practice&#xD;
      regarding administration of systemic corticosteroids among patients with COVID-19 ARDS.&#xD;
