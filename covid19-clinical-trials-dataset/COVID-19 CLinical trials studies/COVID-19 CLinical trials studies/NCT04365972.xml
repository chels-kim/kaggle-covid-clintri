  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a major stressor leading to&#xD;
      increased levels of anxiety, and specifically, an excessive fear of being infected and&#xD;
      affected by the disease among major parts of the population. At the same time, the access to&#xD;
      mental health services is limited due to the lockdown policy applied in many countries&#xD;
      worldwide, warranting the development of home-delivered interventions aimed at reducing&#xD;
      stress and anxiety symptoms. Attention Bias modification (ABM) has been found to be an&#xD;
      efficacious computerized intervention to reduce anxiety symptoms. In this open pilot trial,&#xD;
      participants reporting on elevated levels of health anxiety concerning the COVID-19 epidemic&#xD;
      will receive one session of ABM over 5 consecutive days (5 sessions total). Symptoms of&#xD;
      health anxiety, state anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline and post-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The COVID-19 anxiety inventory is a self-report questionnaire screening for concerns and fears regarding COVID-19 contagion. The Inventory consists of 6 items. Scores can range from 6 to 30, with higher scores denoting higher symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 2 days pre-treatment and 1-2 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI) is a validated self-report measure assessing health anxiety. Total score can range from 0 to 42, with higher scores denoting higher symptom severity</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline of the total score of the State Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 days pre-treatment and 1-2 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The State Anxiety Inventory is a validated self-report measure for state anxiety. Total score can range from 20 to 80, with higher scores denoting higher levels of state anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline of the total score of the PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 days pre-treatment and 1-2 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report scale for depression symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores reflecting more symptoms of depression.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 2 days pre-treatment and 1-2 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report scale for generalized anxiety symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 21, with higher scores reflecting more symptoms of generalized anxiety.</description>

    <description>A home-delivered version of ABM will be administered in this open trial. ABM will be comprised of 5 sessions with a variation of the dot-probe task in which the target probe always replaces the neutral stimuli to induce diversion of attention away from threat. This condition was found effective in reducing anxiety symptoms.</description>
