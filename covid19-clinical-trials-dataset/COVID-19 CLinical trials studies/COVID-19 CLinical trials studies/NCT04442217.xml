      Study description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preset study seeks to investigate factors associated with of hygiene-related behaviors&#xD;
      and adherence to viral mitigation protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular,&#xD;
      factors associated with of adherence to WHO-advised hygiene-related behaviors and adherence&#xD;
      to governmental mitigation protocols are investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform the policymakers, the general public, scientists, and health practitioners about&#xD;
           the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, motivational, and trait components underlying&#xD;
           hygiene-related behaviors and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help policymakers better understand adherence and the factors it is associated with,&#xD;
           providing empirical grounds to advance societies battle against the COVID-19-virus from&#xD;
           an epidemiological perspective by promoting factors that increase adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Research questions Hypothesis 1: Risk perception, altruism and governmental trust&#xD;
      will significantly be associated with both adherence and hygiene-related behavior, with&#xD;
      increased risk perception, altruism, and governmental trust associated with higher rates of&#xD;
      adherence and hygiene-related behavior. The personality traits conscientiousness and&#xD;
      agreeableness will significantly be associated with both adherence and hygiene related&#xD;
      behavior, with increased conscientiousness, and agreeableness associated with higher rates of&#xD;
      adherence and hygiene-related behavior. Furthermore, beliefs about pandemic protocol efficacy&#xD;
      and beliefs about collective mitigation behavior (i.e., &quot;it is only useful to follow&#xD;
      transmission protocols if everyone else does&quot;) will be associated with adherence to viral&#xD;
      mitigation protocols and hygiene-related behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 1: Is there a difference between the use of various platforms to obtain&#xD;
      information about COVID with regards to adherence to viral mitigation protocols and&#xD;
      hygiene-related behaviors? Research Question 2: To what extend are different sources of&#xD;
      obtaining information associated with adherence to hygiene-related behavior and adherence to&#xD;
      viral mitigation protocols? Research Question 3: To what extent are different personality&#xD;
      traits (measured with the Short Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10)) associated with adherence to&#xD;
      viral mitigation protocols and hygiene-related behaviors?&#xD;

      viral mitigation protocols and hygiene-related behaviors?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hierarchical regression analyses will be conducted: one with adherence to hygiene-related&#xD;
      behavior as the dependent variable, and the second with adherence to pandemic protocols as&#xD;
      the dependent variable. In both hierarchical regression analysis, the first step will include&#xD;
      the demographic characteristics (control variables) age, gender, and education. The second&#xD;
      step will include risk perception, altruism, governmental trust, personality traits (i.e.,&#xD;
      neuroticism, extroversion-introversion, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness), beliefs&#xD;
      about pandemic protocol efficacy and beliefs about collective mitigation behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part correlations will be reported, presenting the effect size of the hypothesized predictors&#xD;
      on adherence, revealing the most important variables related to adherence behavior.&#xD;
      Multicollinearity and other statistical assumptions will be checked using examined.&#xD;
      Multicollinearity will be assessed with common guidelines (VIF &lt; 5 and Tolerance &gt; 0.2;&#xD;
      Hocking, 2003; O'Brian, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses and questions addressed in the forthcoming paper that are not pre-specified in&#xD;
      this pre-registered protocol will be defined as exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses and random subsample replications of the main findings will be conducted&#xD;
      following selection of a random sample of participants that ensure a proportionate ratio&#xD;
      between the collected sample and the adult population of Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible transformations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be assessed in their original and validated format as is recommended&#xD;
      practice, as long as this is possible with regards to statistical assumptions underlying the&#xD;
      pre-defined analyses (i.e., multiple regression). However, if this is not possible with&#xD;
      regards to the statistical assumptions behind the analyses, transformation (e.g., square root&#xD;
      or log-transformations) may be needed to apply interval-based methods. The investigators will&#xD;
      examine the degree of skewness and evaluate this against the assumptions and analyses before&#xD;
      choosing the appropriate analysis. The pre-registered and planned analyses include multiple&#xD;
      regression as long as the assumptions underlying these analyses are met. Alternatively, a&#xD;
      non-parametric test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inference criteria Given the large sample size in this study, the investigators pre-define&#xD;
      their significance level: p &lt; 0.01 to determine significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is part of a larger project with the first part aiming to investigate&#xD;
      predictors of adherence through regression analyses, and the second part aiming to examine&#xD;
      directional relations amongst specific symptoms and their centrality through complex systems&#xD;
      approaches (i.e., network analysis). Consequently, power calculations are based on power&#xD;
      required for network analyses. Following power analysis guidelines by Fried &amp; Cramer (2017),&#xD;
      it is recommended that the number of participants are three times larger than the number of&#xD;
      estimated parameters. However, more conservative recommendations by Roscoe (1975) for&#xD;
      multivariate research, recommends sample size that is ten times larger than the number of&#xD;
      estimated parameters. Thus, following these two approaches respectively, between 1395 to 4650&#xD;
      participants are required. Data will be collected for three weeks, and participants are based&#xD;
      on a representative and random sample of Norwegian adults, randomly selected and provided&#xD;
      equal opportunity to partake in the study, providing digital consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TSD system (Services for Sensitive Data), a platform used in Norway to store&#xD;
      person-sensitive data verifies participants officially through a kind of national ID number&#xD;
      to give them full right to withdraw their data at any time, following the European GDPR&#xD;
      (General Data Protection Regulation) laws. Accordingly, participants are allowed to withdraw&#xD;
      their own data at any time. The survey includes mandatory fields of response. Participation&#xD;
      is voluntarily, and withdrawal of provided data is possible at any moment. The investigators&#xD;
      do not expect participants to withdraw their data and thus expect no missing data. However,&#xD;
      if participants do withdraw their data, The investigators will conduct state-of-art missing&#xD;
      data analyses and investigate whether data is missing at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: as described in primary outcome measures section: 1) adherence to viral&#xD;
      mitigation protocols; and 2) adherence to WHO-recommended hygiene-related behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors: All 5 Big Five Personality Traits are measured by the validated Brief Version of&#xD;
      the Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI-10). Risk perception is measured with a three-item&#xD;
      measure adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic, querying about the perceived risk of the COVID-19&#xD;
      virus for 1) oneself; 2) other individuals; and 3) society at large. Governmental trust is&#xD;
      measured with a single item adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic, querying about the whether one&#xD;
      trusts in the governments judgements and decisions concerning handling of the pandemic.&#xD;
      Altruism is measured with a single item adapted for the pandemic, querying about personal&#xD;
      importance given to helping society and peers. Beliefs about protocol efficacy and beliefs&#xD;
      about collective mitigation behavior are both measured with single items adapted for the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic, querying about beliefs concerning the efficacy of initiated protocols&#xD;
      against the pandemic and beliefs about perceived usefulness of adhering when a proportion of&#xD;
      others do not.&#xD;
