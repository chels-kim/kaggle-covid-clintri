  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have found that many patients getting treatment for cancer have trouble&#xD;
      getting enough to eat, or do not always have enough money for food. When a patient has these&#xD;
      problems it can lead to difficulties with completing cancer treatment. Across New York City,&#xD;
      there are many hospitals that offer their patients food pantry services on location. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to compare how food pantries within the hospital and two other food&#xD;
      assistance options: monthly food vouchers and weekly grocery deliveries maybe possible&#xD;
      solutions to this problem. The patient will be randomly assigned to one of the three&#xD;
      different food program groups, which means everyone has an equal chance in being in any&#xD;
      group, like a flip of a coin. The investigators hope to learn how to best help patients with&#xD;
      trouble getting food and to see if this will help with completing cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original RCT composed of study arms: 1) hospital -based food pantry (control), 2) food&#xD;
      voucher program plus access to the food pantry, and 3) grocery delivery program plus access&#xD;
      to the food pantry will remain open to accrual at Ralph Lauren Cancer Center. The other three&#xD;
      sites of the original RCT, Lincoln Hospital, Queens Cancer Center and Brooklyn Hospital, have&#xD;
      reached target accrual. Our modified RCT, to be carried out among an expanded cohort of&#xD;
      cancer patients is composed of study arms : 1) Food Voucher Program (Voucher); 2) Home&#xD;
      Grocery Delivery Program (Delivery); and 3) Medically-tailored, Hospital-based Food Pantry&#xD;
      (Pantry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this RCT, we will enroll patients across three Bronx hospitals- Jacobi Medical Center,&#xD;
      St. Barnabas Hospital, and Montefiore Medical Center. For the new study arms, we will enroll&#xD;
      patients across Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, Jacobi Medical Center, St. Barnabas&#xD;
      Medical Center, and Montefiore Health System. Before conducting the RCT across Lincoln&#xD;
      Medical and Mental Health Center and the three new sites in the Bronx, we will refine written&#xD;
      educational materials to be used in the intervention through focus groups.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analytic approach for these secondary outcome variables will be a series of Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMS) modeling the change scores from baseline to each of the follow-up assessments, separately for each of the questionnaire outcome variables [51]. Analyses based on change scores have the advantage of creating easily interpretable results and clearly indicating the direction of individual change (e.g., increased protein intake).</description>

    <description>In the Food Voucher arm, each participant will receive a debit card specifically created for this program. Each month for the duration of study participation (6 months), the debit card will be credited with $128 and given to the patient in person or via mail. Patients will be instructed to use these cards only for food purchases. They will be counseled on using their vouchers only for healthful foods, in a way that stretches their food dollars. Purchases will be tracked by having patients bring their receipts in for review each month when they come in to pick-up their next monthly vouche, or by providing electronic copies of receipts. Patients will be provided with a receipt holder to assist in storing receipts for review. For voucher cards sent via mail, patients will receive a mailing letter accompanying each card.</description>

    <description>In the Home Grocery Delivery arm, each participant will receive home grocery delivery from PeaPod grocery delivery service or from FreshDirect (depending on the participant&quot;s zip code), worth $128 per month, for the duration of study participation (6 months). Patients in the Delivery arm will review a list of food categories and a subset of items in each category with a COA.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will have access to the pantry for the duration of their study participation (6 months). Those accessing the medically-tailored food pantry will pick-up a pantry bag weekly at the hospital, either during one of their medical appointments or at another preferred time. Each patient's food prefereces will be assessed once during baseline and they will be given food bags, tailored when possible and when available to these preferences and to their medical needs and cultural preferences.</description>

    <description>Each survey will take about 45 minutes.Surveys will include questions on medical treatment, health insurance, work-related information, overall health and well being, eating habits, and satisfaction/use of the food program provided. 3 and 6-month follow-up. All participants will be asked to complete the study contact form. Need Assessment surveys will be administered via telephone or in person. The content of the needs assessment questionnaire has been informed by themes generated through IHCD's ongoing research and community outreach and service activities with the cancer patient population at our participating institutions. The survey will ask participants about the impact on their cancer care and their socioeconomic needs of the COVID-19 crisis.</description>
