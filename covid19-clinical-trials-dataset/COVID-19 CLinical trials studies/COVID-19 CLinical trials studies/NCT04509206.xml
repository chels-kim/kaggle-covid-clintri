  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel way of delivering nutritional education is through experiential learning in a&#xD;
      teaching kitchen setting. Studies have shown that patients with metabolic syndrome who&#xD;
      underwent a series of classes that featured nutrition recommendations and cooking classes had&#xD;
      improved cardiac health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boston Medical Center (BMC) serves many underserved, low-income patients and has developed an&#xD;
      innovative strategy to combat food insecurity and its consequences. This includes a&#xD;
      preventative food pantry, a teaching kitchen, and a rooftop farm that provides fresh produce&#xD;
      directly to the patients. The presence of this well-established three-pronged approach places&#xD;
      our institution in an ideal position to develop a nutritional education intervention that&#xD;
      supports experiential learning in this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increasing focus on providing remote experiences to minimize contact and risk of&#xD;
      infection with Sars-COV-2, the investigators are proposing a study where patients can benefit&#xD;
      from nutritional education virtually. Patients with food insecurity and metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      who utilize the food pantry will be invited to an educational program conducted on zoom. The&#xD;
      program will be run by a registered dietician and chef who will deliver education virtually.&#xD;
      Data will be collected using surveys, phone interviews, chart review, and home monitoring to&#xD;
      test both the feasibility of running such an intervention virtually and to explore whether&#xD;
      attending this program improves cardiac health in patients.&#xD;
