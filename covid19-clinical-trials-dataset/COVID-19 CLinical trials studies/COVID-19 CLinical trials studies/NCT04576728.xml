    <textblock>
      The objectives of the trial are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trimodulin as add-on&#xD;
      therapy to standard of care (SoC) compared to placebo treatment in adult hospitalized&#xD;
      subjects with severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of trimodulin will be&#xD;
      evaluated in all subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center, phase II trial&#xD;
      investigating the efficacy and safety of trimodulin compared to placebo treatment, as add-on&#xD;
      therapy to SoC in adult subjects with severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 patients with need for&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen and with dysregulated inflammatory responses&#xD;
      demonstrated by an elevated CRP level, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either trimodulin or placebo on a 1:1 basis,&#xD;
      stratified by center. Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) treatments will be blinded.&#xD;
      Subjects will be administered IMP once daily on five consecutive days (day 1 through day 5)&#xD;
      as add-on therapy to SoC. The subsequent follow-up phase comprises 23 [+3] days (day 6&#xD;
      through day 28) followed by an end-of-trial visit/ telephone call on day 29 [+3]. For&#xD;
      evaluation of this trial, a 9-category ordinal scale will be used. The primary aim of&#xD;
      trimodulin treatment in the enrolled severely ill patients with a score of 5, is to prevent&#xD;
      their clinical deterioration to a critical disease stage (score 6-7, e.g. requiring invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation or ECMO) and death (score 8). Accordingly, a composite primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint reflecting the deterioration / mortality rate is used.&#xD;
