  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, 3-arm randomized dose finding study in UK to evaluate safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate against Covid-19. 150 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive two shots of the vaccine candidate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multicenter, dose finding Phase 1/2 study starts off with an open-label, dose-escalation&#xD;
      part, thereafter, during the double-blind part of study, participants will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1:1 to receive the low, medium or high dose of the vaccine (VLA2001). All participants will&#xD;
      received a total of two vaccinations intramuscularly, on day 1 and day 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 5 participants in each dose group will receive VLA2001 open label, starting with&#xD;
      the low dose of VLA2001. If no safety concerns are identified, the next 5 subjects will&#xD;
      receive the medium dose of the vaccine. Again, if no safety issues are identified, 5&#xD;
      participants will be vaccinated with the high dose vaccine. A Data Safety and Monitoring&#xD;
      Board (DSMB) will review accrued safety data before randomization of the remaining 135&#xD;
      subjects across all sites will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity up to approximately&#xD;
      6 months after receiving their second vaccination.&#xD;

             subject's well-being, might interfere with evaluation of study endpoints, or would&#xD;
             limit the subject's ability to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Subject is committed to an institution (by virtue of an order issued either by the&#xD;
             judicial or the administrative authorities).&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Subject has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational&#xD;
             medicinal product (IMP) or device within 4 weeks prior to Visit 0 (screening) or is&#xD;
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IMP, or device during&#xD;
             the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Subject is a member of the team conducting the study or in a dependent relationship&#xD;
             with one of the study team members.&#xD;
