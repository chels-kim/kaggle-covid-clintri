  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on emerging experience and trials from countries affected early by the COVID-19 (COV19)&#xD;
      pandemic, there is evidence that a subgroup of severely affected people develop a&#xD;
      hyperinflammatory (HI) syndrome (COV-HI). Trials are in progress of cytokine inhibition and&#xD;
      other immune modulation to treat COV-HI. This proposal aims to use a rapidly executed cohort&#xD;
      study to characterise the clinical phenotypes of COV-HI in patients in the UK through an&#xD;
      established and nimble network of clinicians and scientists with broad experience of&#xD;
      identifying and treating HI. The aim is to confirm the COV-HI clinical phenotype and using&#xD;
      routine data to try to infer the inflexion point where COV-HI emerges. This would enable&#xD;
      refinement of the proposed treatment algorithm and translates to routine clinical practice to&#xD;
      improve the outlook for COV-HI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early information from the UK ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre)-&#xD;
      COVID-19 Study Case Mix Programme Database 27 March 2020 report that critical care unit&#xD;
      admissions with COVID-19 totaled 775 patients of whom 79 patients have died, 86 patients were&#xD;
      discharged alive from critical care and 609 patients were last reported as still being in&#xD;
      critical care. It is imperative to reduce this high death rate. Emerging evidence from China,&#xD;
      Italy and the US suggests that in a small subset of patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory&#xD;
      disease there is a hyperinflammatory syndrome (COV-HI), which may be contributing to the high&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terminology regarding hyperinflammation is heterogenous. When caused by genetic abnormalities&#xD;
      in children it is called primary or familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH).&#xD;
      Secondary HLH (sHLH) is a hyperinflammatory process driven by infection, rheumatic disorders&#xD;
      and malignancy (usually lymphoproliferative disorders). sHLH is termed macrophage activation&#xD;
      syndrome (MAS) when associated with rheumatic disease, macrophage activation-like syndrome&#xD;
      (MALS) in sepsis, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following immune effector cell&#xD;
      therapies (haplo-identical allogeneic stem cell transplantation or CAR-T cell therapy). It is&#xD;
      likely that such hyperinflammatory states lie on a spectrum and collectively the clinical&#xD;
      phenomenon has been called cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) or hyperinflammation (HI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current diagnostic criteria for HI are based on fHLH (HLH-2004 guidelines) and the H score (a&#xD;
      weighted composite generating a probability). Recently published management algorithms in&#xD;
      adults are based on consensus expert opinion and clinical experience, extrapolated from&#xD;
      paediatric literature in fHLH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HLH Across-speciality Collaboration (HASC) is a 162-strong group of clinicians/scientists&#xD;
      who specialize in the management of patients with hyperinflammation. HASC member include&#xD;
      Rheumatologists, Haematologists, Intensivists, Infectious Disease specialists, Immunologists,&#xD;
      Virologists, Nephrologists and Gatroenterologists from both adult and paediatric backgrounds.&#xD;
      Members of HASC have led the set-up of multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTs) to raise&#xD;
      awareness of and manage hyperinflammatory illness, completed national audits to demonstrate&#xD;
      hyperinflammation is often missed and have set up HLH registries and bioresources&#xD;
      (https://research.ncl.ac.uk/ukhr/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 hyperinflammation (COV-HI): rationale for treatment and summary of available&#xD;
      evidence In COVID-19 respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is&#xD;
      the leading cause of mortality. ARDS is a late pre-terminal event in these patients but there&#xD;
      is a reported clinical phenotype of severe COVID-19 where hyperinflammation complicates the&#xD;
      respiratory failure, termed here COVID-19 hyperinflammation or COV-HI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cytokine profile resembling sHLH (a variant of HI) is associated with COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      severity, characterised by increased interleukin (IL), -2, -6 -7, -8 granulocyte-colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor, interferon-ginducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1,&#xD;
      macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α and tumour necrosis factor-α[i]. Predictors of fatality&#xD;
      from two recent retrospective, multi-centre studies of confirmed COVID-19 cases included&#xD;
      elevated ferritin, c reactive protein (CRP) and serum IL-6. In the first study of 150&#xD;
      confirmed cases, the mean ferritin was 1297.6 ng/ml in non-survivors (n=68) versus 614.0&#xD;
      ng/ml in survivors (n=82); p&lt;0.001) 9. Subsequently in 193 confirmed cases, the mean ferritin&#xD;
      was 1453 ng/ml in non-survivors (n=54) versus 503 ng/ml in survivors (n=137) (p&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
      Ferritin &gt;300ng/ml (p=0.0038) and raised IL-6 (p=0.0080) were both associated with&#xD;
      in-hospital death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data publicly available on MedRciv demonstrates that in a retrospective study of 100 patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 pneumonia, disease activity correlated with parameters known to be elevated in&#xD;
      HLH, including IL-6 (p&lt;0.001) and ferroprotein (p&lt;0.001). Publicly available data on Chinaciv&#xD;
      of 21 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab (anti-IL6 blockade),&#xD;
      demonstrated that all patients became afebrile within 24 hours of treatment. In this study&#xD;
      following tocilizumab treatment there was a reduction of oxygen requirement (15/20 patients),&#xD;
      resolution of CT lesions (19/21 patients), normalization of lymphocyte count (10/19&#xD;
      patients), reduction of CRP levels (16/19 patients) and hospital discharge (19/21 patients)&#xD;
      with an average hospitalization duration of 13.5 days. There were no adverse events&#xD;
      attributable to tocilizumab. Personal communication from the investigators in Italy and&#xD;
      treating physicians within the UK, has confirmed clinical benefit using tocilizumab in a&#xD;
      group phenotypically in the COV-HI group, without overt adverse event. Trials are opening&#xD;
      internationally using tocilizumab in the COV-HI group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-1 is central to the hypercytokinaemia in HLH. Off-licence anakinra, a recombinant&#xD;
      humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is recommended in treatment algorithms for HLH. There are&#xD;
      active trials looking at the role of anakinra (see for example&#xD;
      https://www.sobi.com/sites/default/files/pr/202003183346-1.pdf) and tocilizumab (see for&#xD;
      example http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=494090) in the management of COV-HI&#xD;
      patients and insertion of cytokine inhibitor arms into the adaptive platform REMAP CAP&#xD;
      (https://www.remapcap.org). There is increasingly reported anecdotal experience of successful&#xD;
      use of tocilizumab and anakinra in COV-HI and scientific rationale for plausibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these findings suggest that high mortality may be due to virally-driven&#xD;
      hyperinflammation in COVID-19 (COV-HI), that could be identified with routinely available&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory data. Of particular note are C-reactive protein - CRP a surrogate for&#xD;
      IL-6 - and ferritin, both tested in general medical assessment of unwell patients. Outcome&#xD;
      could be improved if the COV-HI phenotype can be characterised; such phenotyping will inform&#xD;
      trial design (in which HASC members are heavily involved) as well as identifying patients in&#xD;
      hospitals overwhelmed by clinical cases who can be recruited to those trials. In particular,&#xD;
      understanding the clinical course of those admitted to hospital (who by definition have&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 and are at risk of COV-HI) and the inflexion point at which COV-HI emerges&#xD;
      would enable targeted treatment. Such characterisation of phenotype is currently not&#xD;
      available but HASC have mobilised the UK network to collect the data to inform this gap in&#xD;
      the evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying people who, at the point of needing respiratory support, could potentially&#xD;
      benefit from immune modulation may be possible by interrogating continuous clinical &amp;&#xD;
      laboratory data collected from hospital admission to the time of recovery/death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a retrospective cohort study. Due to the urgent nature of this research and the&#xD;
      need to rapidly gather information about each patient's clinical experience and outcome&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic it will not be possible to gain informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect demographic information on consecutive people admitted to selected sites across&#xD;
           the UK (initially UCLH, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield) with COVID-19 starting with the&#xD;
           institution's first case. Hospital admission is proxy for severe COVID 19. Map their&#xD;
           clinical journey by collecting serial clinical and laboratory data from routine clinical&#xD;
           investigations during the course of their illness at 24-hour intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospectively analyse data to try to identify patients who subsequently fit the COV-HI&#xD;
           phenotype. Look in detail at these cases to understand whether there is an inflexion&#xD;
           point early in their disease course such that a point for intervention with immune&#xD;
           modulation could be have been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It will be important to differentiate between people deteriorating due to organ failure&#xD;
           because of co-morbidity and poor reserve, compared to those with overwhelming&#xD;
           inflammatory response fitting with the proposed hypothesis. For the former group, the&#xD;
           risk associated with immune modulation is likely to outweigh the benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use data collection to define criteria that could be used as threshold for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified data will be accessed by all members of the team who have contributed their&#xD;
      patients to the study and to collaborators within the UK for statistical analysis. Patient&#xD;
      age will be retained in the de-identified data as this is an essential clinical variable but&#xD;
      NHS number, DOB, ICNARC number and date of admission will not be visible to members of the&#xD;
      team who are not the normal care team of a given patient. The risk of identification of a&#xD;
      patient from their age and diagnosis alone is very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyone with access to person-identifiable information will hold an NHS contract or honorary&#xD;
      contract and have received necessary training regarding GDPR and Good Clinical Practice, and&#xD;
      will be fully aware of their responsibilities to patient confidentiallity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understand and comply with the law. This has been set up as a research study using project&#xD;
      specific data stored on the REDCap platform at Newcastle University. The data will be held on&#xD;
      secure servers with dual password protection (login and SMS OTP) at Newcastle University.&#xD;
