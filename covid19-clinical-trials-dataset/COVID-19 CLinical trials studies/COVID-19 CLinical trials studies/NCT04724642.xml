  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The corona pandemic is a continuing global challenge due to Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to confirm the accepted hypothesis from the recommendations of&#xD;
      The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, that the vaccine for COVID-19 is&#xD;
      safe and has good efficacy in immunocompromised patients after a bone marrow transplant from&#xD;
      a donor / cellular therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients and those who have&#xD;
      received CART therapy - immunocompromised patients who are vaccinated with COVID-19 in a&#xD;
      commercial preparation, regardless of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are routinely performed before receiving the vaccine in the bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant unit -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood count and lymphocyte subgroup counts before vaccination (up to 48 hours before&#xD;
           vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of GVHD activity and accompanying toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Receipt of a letter confirming the vaccination to the HMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. One-week follow-up after vaccination including blood count, complete chemistry, GVHD&#xD;
           evaluation, and review of adverse reactions that may be vaccine-related.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Referral for a second dose of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. One week follow-up after vaccination including blood count, complete chemistry, GVHD&#xD;
           evaluation, review of side effects that may be vaccine related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are performed only as part of the study -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serology test (IgG AntiS) two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine to test the&#xD;
           effectiveness of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cell separation two weeks after the second vaccination and execution -&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ELISpot test to test for the release of interferon gamma in response to the stimulation&#xD;
           of cells separated with the SARS-COV-2 virus peptides (stimulation with S peptides to&#xD;
           evaluate vaccine response, and stimulation with M peptides as a control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected in the study will be typed into Excel and analyzed using SPSS version&#xD;
      25.0. Continuous data will be described using averages and standard deviations, and&#xD;
      categorical data will be described using prevalence and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of the continuous variables will be presented using an outline graph and&#xD;
      will be examined using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attempt will be made to perform subgroup analysis (depending on the frequency of the&#xD;
      groups in the sample) for the patient group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients after bone marrow transplantation with acute GVHD Patients after bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation with chronic GVHD Patients after bone marrow transplantation without&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy Patients after Cell Therapy (CART) Patients lack primary&#xD;
      immunization&#xD;
