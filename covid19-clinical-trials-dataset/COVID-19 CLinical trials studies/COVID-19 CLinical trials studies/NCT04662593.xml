  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wholehearted living touches every aspect of life, from eating nourishing foods, to enjoying&#xD;
      enough physical activity, to cultivating relationships that support healthy choices, to&#xD;
      joining with neighbors to stand up for positive changes, and more. Unfortunately, for many&#xD;
      low-income Californians, the idea of wholehearted living is an aspiration and not a reality.&#xD;
      Koa Family: Strong, Healthy, Whole is an approach designed to make wholehearted living&#xD;
      available for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Approach Koa Family is a 4-month journey to establish &quot;micro-communities&quot; of women&#xD;
      supporting one another- mind, body, and spirit. The foundation of this approach is a new,&#xD;
      custom-designed, online Whole Health Program (WHP) that addresses healthy eating, physical&#xD;
      activity, and weight management within the context of wholehearted living. Low-income women&#xD;
      and a lifestyle coach will meet weekly in a virtual platform to learn, experience, grow, and&#xD;
      thrive as they reach their diet, physical activity, and weight management goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the WHP will receive additional encouragement and access to local resources&#xD;
      through a private and secure Facebook group. The group will provide a place for women to&#xD;
      continue their wholehearted health journeys beyond the weekly meetings. Koa Family&#xD;
      participants also will be invited to take part in a neighborhood tree planting campaign to&#xD;
      create real, long-lasting, healthy changes to the environment in which they live.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Koa Family, with WHP at its core, is the product of extensive formative research&#xD;
      both nationally and within low-income California communities. Koa Family will be introduced&#xD;
      in Sacramento County in February 2021. It will be evaluated for effectiveness among 120&#xD;
      low-income, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)-Ed eligible women using a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial study design, the gold standard for assessing effectiveness of an&#xD;
      intervention. Outcomes include changes in Body Mass Index, diet, and physical activity&#xD;
      measured at 4 and 6 months from baseline. An economic analysis will assess the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of Koa Family, while qualitative methods will identify mediating factors&#xD;
      related to the study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding Koa Family is a project of the Population Health Group at the University of&#xD;
      California, Davis, Center for Healthcare Policy and Research. Funding is provided by the&#xD;
      United States Department of Agriculture Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education&#xD;
      and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFIRE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Koa Family Study is a randomized controlled trial testing a 17-week intervention, the Koa&#xD;
      Family Program (KFP), consisting of three components: (1) the Whole Health Program (WHP)-a&#xD;
      weekly, online group session facilitated by a health coach using the Zoom platform; (2)&#xD;
      social media support including texting of health messages and a private Facebook group; and&#xD;
      (3) a community empowerment arm designed around tree planting. The KFP addresses well-being&#xD;
      from physical, mental, and social health perspectives. The program is intended to increase&#xD;
      weight loss while fostering self-empowerment and connections to community resources to help&#xD;
      sustain long-term weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention participants, consisting of low-income overweight or obese women living in&#xD;
           urban communities, receiving the KFP will have greater average weight loss and reduction&#xD;
           in body mass index (BMI) than participants in the control group (who do not participate&#xD;
           in the KFP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. KFP participants will show greater improvements in dietary practices compared with&#xD;
           participants in the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. KFP participants will have greater increases in physical activity compared with control&#xD;
           group participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. KFP participants will have greater improvements in measures of well-being) compared with&#xD;
           control group participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There will be a dose-response effect where greater engagement with the components of the&#xD;
           KFP will be associated with larger improvements in the above endpoints (weight, diet,&#xD;
           physical activity, and well-being).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The primary study will employ a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design. One hundred twenty eligible participants will be assigned to either the intervention&#xD;
      (n=60) or control (n=60) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The intervention group (n=60) will participate in the 17-week, KFP that&#xD;
      supports physical, mental, and social well-being. It consists of: (1) theWHP-a weekly, online&#xD;
      group session facilitated by a health coach using the Zoom platform; (2) social media support&#xD;
      including texting of health messages and a private Facebook group; and (3) a community&#xD;
      empowerment arm designed around tree planting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHP is a small group-focused intervention designed to build &quot;micro-communities&quot; of&#xD;
      mothers supporting one another in healthy living. Groups of 5-10 women living in the same&#xD;
      community will meet online for 75 minutes weekly via the Zoom platform, for a total of 17&#xD;
      sessions. Each weekly session will cover a topic on whole-person living, including healthy&#xD;
      eating, physical activity, weight management, coping, and resilience. The content of the WHP&#xD;
      is based, in part, on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program (PT2) and Family Hui, a peer-led, women's group program to increase&#xD;
      positive parenting skills and help families thrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For social media support, the intervention participants will receive brief text messages on&#xD;
      their cell phones to encourage healthy lifestyle choices and connect to supportive community&#xD;
      events and resources. EZTexting will be used to send text messages to participants. The&#xD;
      participants also will be invited to join a private Facebook community, linked to each WHP&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principles and practice for tree planting and stewardship will be taught within the WHP&#xD;
      sessions. If public health policy at the time, relating to managing Coronavirus Disease&#xD;
      (COVID)-19 permits, participants may choose to participate in community tree plantings while&#xD;
      complying with public health directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group participants will be enrolled for study measurements only and after the&#xD;
      intervention period, will receive information based on what is proven effective in the RCT.&#xD;
      This information will be delivered in a series of three webinars delivered after the last&#xD;
      study data are collected at 25 weeks after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. All participants will be asked to complete a phone-based, questionnaire&#xD;
      administered by trained research staff. It will take about 50 minutes to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Questions will cover diet, physical activity, and well-being. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered at baseline, at week 18 after completion of the 17-week&#xD;
      intervention, and at week 26 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about week 8, an online focus group will be conducted as part of one of the sessions to&#xD;
      qualitatively assess participants' experiences with the KFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight will be collected, daily, through a research-quality, Bluetooth-enabled scale that can&#xD;
      transmit participant weights via the Internet to a secure server.&#xD;
