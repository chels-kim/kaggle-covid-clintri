      Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) is a disabling condition that affects the 2% of migraine&#xD;
      population. Medication overuse (MO) makes this condition very difficult to treat. The&#xD;
      literature of the last decades confirm the efficacy of withdrawal for patients with&#xD;
      medication overuse, but it is also confirmed that patients have to be carefully followed&#xD;
      after withdrawal to avoid relapses and to improve the clinical benefit of the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach. Clinical results can be improved when traditional therapies are combined with&#xD;
      behavioral approaches in particular mindfulness, that help patient to become more conscious&#xD;
      about their symptoms and able to manage pain without medication. As the emergency situation&#xD;
      due to the Corona-virus pandemic phenomenon in Italy, the regular clinical practice adopted&#xD;
      for patients with CM-MO has changed in the last weeks: patients cannot come to the hospital&#xD;
      for the withdrawal iv therapy and for regular follow up as the reduced mobility due to the&#xD;
      emergency in particular in the Lombardia region, but all over Italy. So the investigators&#xD;
      propose a pilot study to enforce the application of a Home-program for the withdrawal&#xD;
      procedure for patients and the use of technology like smartphone and video calls so that&#xD;
      patients can continue to be followed in their therapeutic process by using behavioral support&#xD;
      and mindfulness practice. Patients will perform the withdrawal program at home, by oral&#xD;
      administration of therapies, with specific instructions and education. Also the information&#xD;
      for behavioral approach and mindfulness practice will be given, to use every day at home.&#xD;
      Daily standardized mindfulness sessions of 12 minutes on their smartphone will be combined&#xD;
      with weekly video-call to evaluate the clinical condition and to encourage the use strategies&#xD;
      for pain management. Face-to-face visits at the follow up every three months will be&#xD;
      scheduled. This modality will allow the patients to continue their therapeutic process and to&#xD;
      be regularly followed during the one year after withdrawal.&#xD;

      Background and significance Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) is a disabling pain syndrome&#xD;
      with a prevalence of 2% in the general population, and which affects patients suffering from&#xD;
      primary headaches, mainly those with Chronic Migraine (CM). This condition is very difficult&#xD;
      to treat. The literature of the last decades confirmed the need to stop overuse through&#xD;
      withdrawal (or detoxification programs) as an essential step in the treatment strategy , and&#xD;
      high rates of successful outcomes are reported by several studies and reviews, although not&#xD;
      all patients receiving treatment are able to stop MO or to reduce significantly the frequency&#xD;
      of headaches. Remission rates range from 60% to 83% in studies with a 1-year follow-up, with&#xD;
      an average relapse rate into MOH of 32.8% in a review on several studies from different&#xD;
      countries, which is similar to the relapse into CM of 21.5% and into MOH of 33.9% found in a&#xD;
      sample from our group . Literature data showed that patients need to be carefully followed&#xD;
      after withdrawal to avoid relapses in overuse and to improve the clinical benefit, adding&#xD;
      anti-migraine prophylaxi . Furthermore, different clinical experiences confirmed the&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions based on out-patient withdrawal programs and education and&#xD;
      support to the correct use of medications to patients, and published evidence - also from our&#xD;
      research group - supports the role of standardized behavioural approaches . The aspect of&#xD;
      feasibility of these treatments is not regularly reported in published studies, but it can be&#xD;
      estimated that a proportion of patients discontinue the treatment protocols, with a drop-out&#xD;
      rate around 15-20% at one year from withdrawal., as it was 11% after 6 months, and 18% after&#xD;
      1 year in the seminal study by Katsarawa et al, and 9% after one year from withdrawal in a&#xD;
      previous study from our research group . According to our protocols at the Headache Center,&#xD;
      the withdrawal program is performed at hospital, either in an in-patient setting or in&#xD;
      day-hospital setting. This program includes abrupt interruption of the overused drugs,&#xD;
      intravenous therapy, educational support, rescue treatments for severe headaches, and&#xD;
      prescription of a specific pharmacological prophylaxis for migraine prevention. Furthermore,&#xD;
      standardized behavioural therapies are used during the treatment period, and during the&#xD;
      follow up, particularly by approaches based on mindfulness practice - which usually delivered&#xD;
      in groups of 4 - 8 patients . This approach may be particularly useful in helping patients to&#xD;
      obtain a better outcome. All the above discussed considerations are even more relevant in&#xD;
      this emergency situation due to the Corona-virus pandemic phenomenon in Italy, with its&#xD;
      consequences on mobility of patients and clinical practice. In order to promote different&#xD;
      modalities to respond to the needs of patients suffering from this disabling condition during&#xD;
      the emergency, exercise-based telemedicine and smartphone applications seem very appropriate,&#xD;
      as they have been recently tested in the management of chronic pain conditions . This&#xD;
      preliminary study will be performed considering that the Covid-19 emergency reduced&#xD;
      significantly our possibility to hospitalize patients for withdrawal treatments as well as&#xD;
      the mobility of patients, particularly those living in other Italian regions than Lombardy,&#xD;
      and in view of providing an effective and somewhat innovative treatment program for MOH and&#xD;
      CM patients. The proposed treatment intervention is based on our experience, and on published&#xD;
      reports, but it specifically includes a home based withdrawal program, several visits&#xD;
      performed as Video calls, and educational and support strategies aimed to develop skills to&#xD;
      reduce overuse and to cope with pain by a standardized behavioural approach based on&#xD;
      mindfulness - which will be delivered mainly by telemedicine and smartphone applications. The&#xD;
      aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness at long-term on&#xD;
      relevant outcomes of a specific protocol, designed to be appropriate during the emergency&#xD;
      situation due to COVID-19 epidemic, by an approach that is alternative to current practice,&#xD;
      particularly as far as avoiding the need for hospitalization, reducing face-to-face hospital&#xD;
      visits taking advantage of facilities offered by new technologies, besides including&#xD;
      innovative and emerging treatment choices, namely a behavioural approach base on mindfulness.&#xD;
