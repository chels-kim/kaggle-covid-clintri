    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to ruxolitinib for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with severe/very severe COVID-19 illness. The patient's Treating Physician&#xD;
      should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requesting Treating Physician submitted a request for access to drug (often referred to&#xD;
      as Compassionate Use) to Novartis which was reviewed and approved by the medical team&#xD;
      experienced with the drug and indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please refer to the latest Investigator's Brochure (IB) or approved label for overview of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib including: non-clinical and clinical experience, risk and benefits. Novartis will&#xD;
      continue to provide any new safety information to the Treating Physician as they emerge.&#xD;
