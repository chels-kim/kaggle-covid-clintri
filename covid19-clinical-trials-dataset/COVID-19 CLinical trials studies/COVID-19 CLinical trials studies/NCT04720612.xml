      COVID-19 cases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 88 million people, resulting in the&#xD;
      death of at least 1.9 million individuals and numbers continue to climb exponentially.&#xD;
      Despite these staggering numbers, there are currently very few effective treatments for&#xD;
      COVID-19. The immune response to COVID-19 virus appears to follow 2 phases. During the&#xD;
      incubation and early disease, interferon (ex. INF-α) signaling and adaptive immunity preclude&#xD;
      the disease from progressing. If, and when, this immune response is impaired, the virus may&#xD;
      cause pathologic inflammation leading to massive organ dysfunction leading to acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE antibody approved by Health Canada for the treatment of&#xD;
      moderate-severe asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Omalizumab has been shown to&#xD;
      exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in virally exacerbated asthma cases that may&#xD;
      be relevant to the treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      single dose of omalizumab in reducing all cause mortality at day 29 in severe hospitalized&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases. Moreover, time to improvement/hospital discharge, incidence and duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and safety will be assessed.&#xD;
