  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study applied the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE) on&#xD;
      respiratory patients who had their on-going ambulatory Pulmonary Rehabilitation program&#xD;
      interrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The research hypothesis is that ranking patients'&#xD;
      self-efficacy is a useful screening tool to support patients' follow-up on a Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation telehealth solution to be explored during the COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an observational study applied to a convenience sample of Pulmonary Rehabilitation&#xD;
      outpatients from Hospital Pulido Valente in Lisbon, Portugal, which had ambulatory treatments&#xD;
      suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Cross-sectional design was operationalized by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist who promptly screened by phone a sample of 100 patients, assessing 90% of the&#xD;
      eligible population. Patients had no previous therapeutic relation with the physiotherapist,&#xD;
      who was also blind to patient's status at the Pulmonary Rehabilitation program. The screening&#xD;
      call took a mean time of 484.8 ± 173.6 seconds, which is proximately about 8 ± 3 minutes per&#xD;
      patient, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 19 minutes. Screening process included applying&#xD;
      the Portuguese version of the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted-Index of Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      (PRAISE) and also included questioning patients if they were engaging on a daily routine of&#xD;
      respiratory exercises by their initiative, and also if they managed to preserve a daily&#xD;
      period to practice physical activity. In case of a positive answer, information concerning&#xD;
      available equipment and exercise protocol adopted at patient's home environment was also&#xD;
      collected. On a subsequent phase, data about patients' age, diagnosis referral for Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation, number of completed treatment sessions and weekly frequency, was collected&#xD;
      from the hospital information system. Statistical analysis and data management were performed&#xD;
      using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). A formal sample size was not calculated since this was a convenience&#xD;
      sample of 100 patients. Descriptive statistics included mean, standard-deviation, median,&#xD;
      quartiles, range, minimum and maximum values and frequencies presented as percentages.&#xD;
      Inferential statistics included the Pearson coefficient for PRAISE, age and number of&#xD;
      treatment sessions, with the remaining variables analysed by the Spearman coefficient. PRAISE&#xD;
      was the primary outcome, with mean comparison analysed by the Student t test, proved the&#xD;
      normal distribution and equal variances. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>Vincent and co-authors (2011) proposed the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE). The PRAISE tool is composed by a total of 15 items, combining 10 items from the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) by Schwarzer and Jerusalem (1995), and 5 new specific items related to Pulmonary Rehabilitation. Each item is scored from 1 to 4 with a total range from 15 to 60, with higher scores indicating higher levels of self-efficacy. This study applies the Portuguese PRAISE version by Santos CD and co-authors (2019).</description>
