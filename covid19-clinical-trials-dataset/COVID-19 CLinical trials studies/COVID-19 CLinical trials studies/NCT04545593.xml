    <textblock>
      This study aims to address treatment and service disparities and prevent disability among&#xD;
      racial/ethnic and linguistic minority elders. It tests the effectiveness and implementation&#xD;
      readiness of the Positive Minds-Strong Bodies Enhanced intervention (PMSB-E), a combined&#xD;
      mental and physical health intervention designed to be implemented in low-resource community&#xD;
      settings. This renewal grant project includes a streamlined intervention with new components&#xD;
      designed to improve and maintain participant outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Positive Minds-Strong Bodies Enhanced intervention addresses the dual challenges of&#xD;
      mental health and physical disability among minority elders. The core Positive Minds&#xD;
      intervention includes 10 sessions offered by Community Health Workers over a maximum of 6&#xD;
      months, designed to identify and correct negative distortions or cognitions, promote&#xD;
      behavioral activation and encourage supportive relationships. Strong Bodies is a 36-session&#xD;
      physical intervention consisting of a series of exercises conducted while wearing a weighted&#xD;
      vest in a group setting over 6 months; both interventions include a group maintenance&#xD;
      component to maintain gains. The investigators will evaluate the acceptability, effectiveness&#xD;
      and twelve-month sustainability of the Enhanced Positive Minds-Strong Bodies intervention&#xD;
      (E-PMSB) offered by Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Exercise Trainers in community-based&#xD;
      organizations (CBOs) and community clinics. The intervention is offered in English, Spanish,&#xD;
      Mandarin or Cantonese.&#xD;
