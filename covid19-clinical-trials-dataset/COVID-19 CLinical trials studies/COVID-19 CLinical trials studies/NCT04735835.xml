  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREDICT 3 study will build on previous research in over 2,000 individuals to further&#xD;
      refine machine learning models that predict individual responses to foods, with the aim of&#xD;
      advancing precision nutrition science and individualized dietary advice. The study&#xD;
      incorporates both standardized and controlled dietary intervention, for the purpose of&#xD;
      testing postprandial responses to specific mixed meals, in addition to a free-living period&#xD;
      with a dietary record for measuring responses to a large variety of meals consumed in a&#xD;
      realistic context, where the role of external factors (e.g. exercise, sleep, time of day) on&#xD;
      postprandial responses may be determined. For the first time this PREDICT study is built on&#xD;
      top of a commercial product which will allow access to a much larger group of participants&#xD;
      who are already collecting large amounts of data through digital and biochemical devices that&#xD;
      can contribute to science.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choice of design: The study is a single arm mechanistic intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The subject must have enrolled in the commercial Zoe testing program in&#xD;
      order to apply for participation in the PREDICT 3 research program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Assessment: The study eligibility criteria listed below closely match to the&#xD;
      commercial eligibility criteria, which Zoe users consent to before enrolling in the&#xD;
      commercial program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Each participant will take part in the study for 6-14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention: The dietary intervention will be carried out on up to 6 days with the&#xD;
      option to continue monitoring for a total study period of 14-days. On day one, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fit glucose monitor. Over the following consecutive days, each participant&#xD;
      will be instructed to eat 2 standardized meals. Participants are free to eat whatever they&#xD;
      wish at all other times. The standardized meals will be provided to all participants by the&#xD;
      study team via post. The foods included as part of these meals will be foods that are&#xD;
      commonly consumed and can be made from products sold in US supermarkets. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to consume the entire amount of food indicated for the standardized meals and to record&#xD;
      any left-over food via a digital app for which training will be provided at the start of the&#xD;
      study. Following completion of standardized meal period, participants are free to eat and&#xD;
      drink whatever they wish and will be asked to track all meals, snacks and drinks on their&#xD;
      digital app. Participants will also be advised not to change their physical activity patterns&#xD;
      during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular contact will be made with the participants via phone, their app and text messages for&#xD;
      the period of the intervention to encourage compliance and answer any queries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: The participant will be instructed to report height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary and Lifestyle: Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      online, as well as a diet history questionnaire with portion sizes about the month preceding&#xD;
      their study period. They will be asked to record on a daily basis their dietary, activity,&#xD;
      and psychological data (e.g. hunger) using a digital mobile phone app. Training in all apps&#xD;
      and equipment will be given through written and online instructions and via communications&#xD;
      with the study support staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital devices: Participants will be asked to record daily dietary and activity information&#xD;
      using digital apps and lifestyle information will be monitored using a wearable device. The&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre, CGM) provides continuous glucose profiles for up&#xD;
      to 14 days. The CGM will be inserted on the back of the upper arm, one day before&#xD;
      participants begin dietary intervention. This will measure subcutaneous interstitial fluid&#xD;
      glucose concentrations every 5 minutes. The CGM will be removed at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period by the participant. A contact number will be made available to&#xD;
      participants for any inquiries or if any problems arise. Data from the CGM will be&#xD;
      downloaded, and glucose profiles will be evaluated on the basis of data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal responses: As a product user, the participant will consume standardized meals an&#xD;
      additional day to the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: As a product user, the participant will collect postprandial blood on 1 day&#xD;
      using finger-prick blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample: As a product user, the participant will collect a stool sample on 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital app: As product users, participants will be asked to download an app designed&#xD;
      specifically for this study, which provides diet logging functionality similar to widely used&#xD;
      existing apps such as MyFitnessPal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to record and monitor the following information via the digital&#xD;
      app:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All food and drink they consume, with serving sizes and photos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep and physical activity patterns, including exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hunger and alertness ratings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological feeling of energy and mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription and over-the-counter drug consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app will be available in versions for iOS operating systems. The app will synchronize&#xD;
      remotely with backend database servers, over an encrypted and authenticated API, and will&#xD;
      support offline operation for when patients wish to record an entry without network coverage.&#xD;
      This continuous background synchronization means that it will not be necessary to explicitly&#xD;
      download data from the phone at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 2020 pandemic of COVID-19, participants are asked to use the COVID-19 Symptom&#xD;
      Tracker app to record their physical health symptoms, or lack thereof, attributable to&#xD;
      COVID-19, as well as demographic and other health information to track the spread of disease&#xD;
      in real time, and to potentially reveal risk factors for infection and severe illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcohort: An opt-in follow-on study will be offered to participants to follow dietary&#xD;
      guidance from the ZOE app based on their Predict 3 results. During the first 4 weeks,&#xD;
      participants will be given dietary guidance to follow from the ZOE app. Thereafter, for a&#xD;
      period of up to 12 months, participants will be asked to report on outcome measures at&#xD;
      regular intervals (monthly). Outcome measures will be reported before, during and after the 4&#xD;
      week period and include weight, bristol stool, bowel habits, hunger, energy, adherence to&#xD;
      dietary advice, and app usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be used to test the efficacy of the ZOE dietary advice in promoting weight loss&#xD;
      and improvement of overall health, and may be stratified by age, sex, BMI, adherence and/or&#xD;
      motivation to take part in the PREDICT 3 study.&#xD;
