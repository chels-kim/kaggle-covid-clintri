  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 patients who develop severe disease often develop acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) as a result of a dysregulated immune response. This in turn stimulates a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cascade (&quot;cytokine storm&quot;) as well as emergency myelopoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proinflammatory cascade is activated when viral-mediated cell damage occurs in the&#xD;
      lungs, resulting in the release of damage-signaling alarmin molecules such as S100A8/A9&#xD;
      (Calprotectin), HMGB1, Resistin, and oxidized phospholipids. These damage-associated&#xD;
      molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized by the pattern recognition receptor Toll-Like&#xD;
      Receptor 4 (TLR4) found on macrophages, dendritic cells and other innate immune cells and&#xD;
      result in additional release of pro-inflammatory molecules. Several recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that S100A8/A9 serum levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients positively correlate with both&#xD;
      neutrophil count and disease severity. Taken together the DAMP-TLR4 interaction forms a&#xD;
      central axis in the innate immune system and is a key driver of the pathological inflammation&#xD;
      observed in COVID-19. We hypothesis that targeting the initial step in the signalling&#xD;
      pathways of these DAMPs in innate immunity offers the best hope for controlling the&#xD;
      exaggerated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EB05 has demonstrated safety in two clinical studies (&gt;120 patients) and was able to block&#xD;
      LPS-induced (TLR4 agonist) IL-6 release in humans. Given, this extensive body of evidence we&#xD;
      believe EB05 could ameliorate ARDS due to COVID-19, significantly reducing ventilation rates&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is currently a Phase 2 in the US and is incorporated into a Phase 2/Phase 3 in Canada. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EB05 in adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Following enrollment in the study, eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 at baseline to receive an infusion of either EB05 or Placebo. In addition to study treatment, all patients will receive SOC treatment per routine care at each participating site. Randomization will be stratified by site and baseline WHO COVID-19 severity strata defined as Level 3-4 and Levels 5-6.&#xD;
The total follow-up duration of each patient will be until 60-days from treatment with the investigational product. All assessments will take place in-hospital except for the 28-day and 60-day follow-up assessment which will be by telephone if the patient has been discharged before this assessment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The severity of COVID-19 related respiratory disease is assessed on the following WHO COVID-19 nine-point ordinal scale:&#xD;
0. Uninfected - No clinical or virological evidence of infection&#xD;
Ambulatory - No limitation of Activities&#xD;
Ambulatory - Limitation of Activities&#xD;
Hospitalized Mild Disease - No Oxygen Therapy&#xD;
Hospitalized Mild Disease - Oxygen by mask or Nasal Prongs&#xD;
Hospitalized Severe Disease - Non-Invasive Ventilation or High-Flow Oxygen&#xD;
Hospitalized Severe Disease - Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation&#xD;
Hospitalized Severe Disease - Intubation + Additional Organ Support - Pressors, RRT, ECMO&#xD;
Death&#xD;
For the current study, the primary efficacy outcome measure will be the proportion of patients that are alive without any need for oxygen support defined as a score of 3 or less in the above scale. The primary endpoint will be assessed at 28-days after treatment initiation.</description>
