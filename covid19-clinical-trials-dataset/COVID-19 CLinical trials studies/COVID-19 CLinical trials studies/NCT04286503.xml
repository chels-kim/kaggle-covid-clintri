    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus infectious disease ( COVID-19&quot;) induced by novel&#xD;
      coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 has outbreaked in Wuhan. It may lead to epidemic&#xD;
      risk in global. As the COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease, it has not scientifically&#xD;
      recognized and has no effective drugs for treatment currently. Therefore, we will launch a&#xD;
      scientific project &quot;The efficacy and safety of carrimycin treatment in 520 patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 stratificated clinically: A multicenter, randomized (1:1), open-controlled (one of&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir tablets or Arbidol or chloroquine phosphate) study&quot; . We try to establish&#xD;
      the criteria for clinical cure and the early predictive model of COVID-19 progression. The&#xD;
      primary efficiency outcomes were:(1) Fever to normal time (day); (2) Pulmonary inflammation&#xD;
      resolution time (HRCT) (day); and (3)Negative conversion (%) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the end of&#xD;
      treatment. The secondary efficiency outcomes and adverse events were observed.&#xD;

      1. Data management The electronic data collection system (EDC) will be used in this study&#xD;
           for the collection and management of the study data to ensure the traceability of the&#xD;
           clinical trial data; the data management process shall comply with the GCP specification&#xD;
           to ensure the authenticity, integrity and accuracy of clinical trial data. The main data&#xD;
           management processes are listed below. For other details, please refer to the data&#xD;
           management plan (DMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           DMP is written by the data manager (DM) as the guiding document for data management. The&#xD;
           data management work will be carried out according to the time, content and method&#xD;
           defined by DMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1Design and establishment of database The data manager designs and constructs the&#xD;
           database according to the trial protocol, and sets up the logic verification according&#xD;
           to the data validation plan (DVP), which i released for use after passing the test and&#xD;
           being approved by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2Data entry The investigator or a person authorized by the investigator shall timely&#xD;
           complete the online data entry after the subject visit, use the printed eCRF form first&#xD;
           if necessary, and, in case of data correction in eCRF if required, fill in the reason&#xD;
           for the data modification according to the system prompt. The logic validation program&#xD;
           of the EDC system will logically check the input data and question the problem data, so&#xD;
           as to facilitate the modification or interpretation by the investigator or the person&#xD;
           authorized by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3Source data validation (SDV) The investigator logs on EDC on the study site, 100%&#xD;
           check the consistency of eCRF data and source data, and ask questions at any time in&#xD;
           case of any problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4Data cleaning After investigator or the person authorized by the investigator enters&#xD;
           the data to EDC according to the protocol requirements, the data manager and medical&#xD;
           personnel shall review the data. The problems in the review shall be answered by the&#xD;
           investigator or the person authorized by the investigator in the form of question until&#xD;
           the question is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5Medical coding The medical coder performs medical coding, including combined drugs&#xD;
           and adverse events. Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRA (20.0 or above)&#xD;
           dictionary and the combined drugs will be classified by WHO ATC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the coding process, DM can question the investigator online in real time about&#xD;
           failure of coding caused by improper, inaccurate or ambiguous medical terms provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A medical review is required for the medical coding before the database lock.&#xD;
           1.6External data management NA 1.7Data review meeting The study leader, statistician and&#xD;
           data manager make the data review before statistical analysis to review the subject&#xD;
           completion, protocol violation, adverse events, analysis data sets (including FAS, PPS&#xD;
           and SS) to determine the attribution of each subject, judgment of missing value and&#xD;
           treatment of outliers. Decisions made on the review meeting cannot be modified after the&#xD;
           database lock, and any decisions must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.8Electronic signature of investigator After the database is frozen, the investigator&#xD;
           conducts electronic signature verification and shall sign the name again in case of data&#xD;
           revision after signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.9Data lock and export After the data in the database meets the quality requirements, a&#xD;
           written approval document of database lock is signed by the data manager, statistical&#xD;
           analyst and investigator representative according to the database lock procedures,&#xD;
           exported by the data manager to the database of specified format and submitted to the&#xD;
           statistician for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical analysis See the &quot;Statistical analysis plan&quot; for the details of the&#xD;
           statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan&#xD;
           according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This&#xD;
           protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content&#xD;
           shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use&#xD;
           the study drug at least once.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied&#xD;
           with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint&#xD;
           measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to&#xD;
           inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification&#xD;
           of the data audit report.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety&#xD;
           evaluation after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency&#xD;
           indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen&#xD;
           nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration&#xD;
           does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency&#xD;
           indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the&#xD;
           missing data shall not be filled in.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General&#xD;
           principle&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description of statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method.&#xD;
           Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median,&#xD;
           quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by&#xD;
           frequency, percentage and the like.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical test:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test&#xD;
           (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation&#xD;
           of inter-group variance parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of&#xD;
           enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets&#xD;
           (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who&#xD;
           are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the&#xD;
           reasons are calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline&#xD;
           characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of&#xD;
           other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General&#xD;
           information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug&#xD;
           exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to&#xD;
           descriptive statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary&#xD;
           classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary efficiency indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging&#xD;
           improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing&#xD;
           in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority&#xD;
           evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025&#xD;
           and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of&#xD;
           pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after&#xD;
           administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively.&#xD;
           The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial&#xD;
           group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval&#xD;
           (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If&#xD;
           the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference&#xD;
           between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that&#xD;
           the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given&#xD;
           that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower&#xD;
           limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between&#xD;
           the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial&#xD;
           drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio&#xD;
           difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will&#xD;
           be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects&#xD;
           may be combined before analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary efficiency indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen&#xD;
           nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative&#xD;
           conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage,&#xD;
           counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and&#xD;
           C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive&#xD;
           statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the&#xD;
           observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after&#xD;
           treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference&#xD;
           estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different&#xD;
           visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the&#xD;
           indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency&#xD;
           and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence&#xD;
           interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of&#xD;
           pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete&#xD;
           antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is&#xD;
           provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90%&#xD;
           confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox&#xD;
           proportional hazards regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.5Safety analysis SS data sets are used for safety analysis. Adverse events are coded&#xD;
           according to the MedDRA. The occurrence of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse&#xD;
           events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is summarized and&#xD;
           analyzed in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The occurrence of varying severity orders of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse&#xD;
           events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is subject to&#xD;
           descriptive statistical analysis in the form of a frequency table (number of cases,&#xD;
           case, and incidence) according to SOC and PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A detailed list of various adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions&#xD;
           and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Changes in the clinical significance determination of laboratory indicators, ECG and&#xD;
