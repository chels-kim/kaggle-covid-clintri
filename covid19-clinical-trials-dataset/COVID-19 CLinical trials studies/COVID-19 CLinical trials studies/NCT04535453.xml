  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess humoral immune responses of 3 dose levels of&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S administered intramuscularly (IM) as a 2-dose schedule (56 days apart);&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S administered IM as a single vaccination; and to test both compressed and expanded&#xD;
      2-dose schedules of Ad26.COV2.S (28 and 84 days apart) in adults (18-65 years or older) and&#xD;
      adolescents (12-17 years).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program is to develop a safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. Currently, there are no available vaccines&#xD;
      for the prevention of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Ad26.COV2.S (also known as&#xD;
      Ad26COVS1) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication incompetent&#xD;
      adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spike (S) protein, which will be assessed in this study.&#xD;
      Also, different vaccination intervals and multiple lower dose levels compared to the dose&#xD;
      levels in the first in human (FIH) study (VAC31518COV1001) will be assessed. For adults, the&#xD;
      study consists of: screening phase (28 days), vaccination phase (1-3 months) depending on the&#xD;
      vaccination interval, and follow-up (12 months) and for adolescents, the study will consist&#xD;
      of a screening phase (28 days), a vaccination phase (2 months), a booster vaccination 12&#xD;
      months after the first vaccination, and a follow-up phase (6 months after the booster&#xD;
      vaccination). The study duration is approximately 15 months for adult groups and&#xD;
      approximately 19 months for adolescents group. The adverse events and other safety&#xD;
      assessments including vital signs measurements (heart rate, supine systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature) and physical examinations will be&#xD;
      assessed during the study.&#xD;
