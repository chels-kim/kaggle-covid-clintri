      The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major and imminent challenge for health care systems regarding&#xD;
      patient triage and allocation of limited resources worldwide. The involved pathogenetic&#xD;
      mechanisms as well as the clinical value of established and emerging biomarkers for early&#xD;
      risk prediction are largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fill these gaps in knowledge, investigators designed the prospective, interdisciplinary,&#xD;
      observational, case-control &quot;COronaVIrus surviVAl (COVIVA)&quot; study platform, aiming to deliver&#xD;
      an open-source platform to i) perform extensive clinical and biomarker phenotyping in&#xD;
      COVID-19 suspects presenting to the emergency department (ED) as well as admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, ii) compare clinical and biomarker profiles of COVID-19 patients with a&#xD;
      control group, iii) derive and validate personalized risk prediction models for early&#xD;
      clinical decision support, and iv) explore pathophysiological mechanisms including but not&#xD;
      limited to inflammatory, immunological and cardiovascular pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (serum) are routinely collected for bio banking both in cases and controls.&#xD;
      Patients are followed 30 days after discharge. Personalized risk prediction models will be&#xD;
      derived and validated based on advanced statistical models including machine-based learning&#xD;
      incorporating a variety of clinical parameters and biomarker signatures (including digitally&#xD;
      stored in-hospital data, e.g. imaging, ECG, ventilation parameters). Close cooperation with&#xD;
      multiple other national and international COVID-19 cohorts is endorsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personalized risk prediction models from the COVIVA study will support clinicians in the&#xD;
      most challenging process of limited resource allocation in a timely fashion. In addition,&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms and differences in mild and severe variants of COVID-19 as well&#xD;
      as in the control group can be extensively studied in a multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a major and imminent challenge for health&#xD;
      care systems regarding patient triage and allocation of limited resources worldwide, but also&#xD;
      in Switzerland. Data from severly affected countries impressively demonstrate that COVID-19&#xD;
      fatality rates rapidly increase in times of overloaded health care services. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      comorbidity seems to be associated with impaired outcome, e.g. with admission to intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) or death. However, a direct causal relation is questionable and&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of the cardiovascular involvement such as the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are poorly understood. The clinical value of established&#xD;
      and emerging biomarkers is largely unknown. Accordingly, early and reliable personalized risk&#xD;
      prediction represents a major unmet clinical need, as it may allow evidence-based clinical&#xD;
      decision aid for most effective resource allocation in the common fight against the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To fill these gaps in knowledge, investigators designed the &quot;COronaVIrus surviVAl&#xD;
      (COVIVA)&quot; study. With this study, investigators aim to deliver an open-source platform to i)&#xD;
      perform extensive clinical and biomarker phenotyping in COVID-19 suspects presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) and in COVID-19 patients with subsequent ICU admission, ii) compare&#xD;
      clinical and biomarker profiles of COVID-19 patients with a control group, iii) derive and&#xD;
      validate personalized risk prediction models for early clinical decision support, and iv)&#xD;
      explore pathophysiological mechanisms including inflammatory and cardiovascular pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The COVIVA study is an ongoing, prospective, interdisciplinary, observational,&#xD;
      case-control study with active enrolment of consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      COVID-19 triaged to the Emergency Department (ED) of the University Hospital in Basel,&#xD;
      Switzerland. Patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab test for severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 will serve as cases while the remainders will serve as controls.&#xD;
      Detailed clinical patient's phenotyping (e.g. comorbidities, medications, symptoms, vitals,&#xD;
      ECG and imaging data), extended laboratory analyses and blood sampling for bio banking are&#xD;
      performed once in all patients (cases and control) at time of ED presentation and serially&#xD;
      thereafter in the subset of COVID-19 patients with subsequent need for ICU admission. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measure is in-hospital mortality; secondary outcome measures include the need for ICU&#xD;
      admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, 30-day post-discharge&#xD;
      mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, resource use and quality of life 30 days after&#xD;
      discharge and its composites. Personalized risk prediction models will be derived and&#xD;
      validated based on advanced statistical models including machine-based learning incorporating&#xD;
      a variety of clinical parameters and biomarker signatures (including digitally stored&#xD;
      in-hospital data, e.g. imaging, ECG, ventilation parameters). Close cooperation with multiple&#xD;
      other national and international COVID-19 cohorts is endorsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential significance: The personalized risk prediction models from the COVIVA study will&#xD;
      support clinicians in the most challenging process of limited resource allocation in a timely&#xD;
      fashion. In addition, pathophysiological mechanisms and differences in mild and severe&#xD;
      variants of COVID-19 as well as in the control group can be extensively studied in a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;

        All patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 or confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection triaged&#xD;
        to the Emergency Department (ED) of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, are&#xD;
        potentially eligible for enrolment in this study. An upstream pre-triage located outside&#xD;
        the ED (in a nearby church) routinely performs clinical risk assessment in all patients&#xD;
        with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of symptoms severity and, if&#xD;
        clinically indicated, nasopharyngeal swab testing. While patients with mild symptoms and in&#xD;
        good clinical condition are assigned towards outpatient management, patients in poorer&#xD;
        clinical conditions and higher likelihood of need for in-patient management are assigned to&#xD;
        the ED, where they will be screened for potential COVIVA inclusion.&#xD;
