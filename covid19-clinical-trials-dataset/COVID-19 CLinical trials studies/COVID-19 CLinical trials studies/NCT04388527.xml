  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if this plasma can be safely used in humans with COVID-19&#xD;
      and to see if it can improve patients' health when they are sick with COVID-19.&#xD;

      This open-label, single arm, phase 1 trial will assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      convalescent plasma in severely ill, mechanically ventilated participants with pneumonia due&#xD;
      to COVID-19. This study will enroll adults 18 years old and older, including pregnant women.&#xD;
      A total of 50 eligible participants will receive 2 units of convalescent plasma collected&#xD;
      from ABO-compatible donors who have recovered from COVID-19. Participants will receive&#xD;
      convalescent plasma on Study Day 1 in addition to standard of care. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed daily while hospitalized and then on Study Days 15, 22, 29, and 60. All participants&#xD;
      will undergo a series of safety, efficacy, and laboratory assessments. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 29, and 60.&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal or endotracheal samples will be collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma&#xD;
      administration), 3, 5, 8, 11, and 15.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Adult â‰¥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by PCR or other authorized or&#xD;
             approved assay in any specimen collected within 72 hours prior to enrollment. Note -&#xD;
             An exception must be requested to the Sponsor ifâ‰¥72 hours since positive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, consistent with a clinical&#xD;
             status assessment 8-point ordinal scale severity score of 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documentation of pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates by imaging (e.g.,&#xD;
             chest x-ray or CT scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient or proxy is willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply&#xD;
             with all protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindication to transfusion (e.g., severe volume overload, history of severe&#xD;
             allergic reaction to blood products), as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness (acute decompensation) is&#xD;
             primarily due to a condition other than COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of other investigational therapy as a part of another clinical trial. a. Note:&#xD;
             investigational therapies used as part of clinical care, (eg, remdesivir,&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine) are permissible.&#xD;
