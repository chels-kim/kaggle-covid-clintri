  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to asses the feasibility of physicians using a wearable brain sensing wellness device&#xD;
      during a time of increased work load, patient volume and stressors to assess the association&#xD;
      between duration of active state and calm state as measured by the wearable brain sensing&#xD;
      wellness device, and quality of life (QOL), subjective stress, sleep and resilience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be instructed on how to use a brain sensing device and corresponding&#xD;
      digital application to engage in structured digital mindfulness practices daily for 3 months.&#xD;
      Subjects will be requested to use the device and practice daily, but the amount of time and&#xD;
      frequency daily will be to their choosing. Subjects will also complete questionnaires and&#xD;
      cognitive based testing throughout participation.&#xD;
