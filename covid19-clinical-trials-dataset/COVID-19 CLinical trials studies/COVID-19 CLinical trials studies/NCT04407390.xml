      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether nicotinamide riboside supplementation can&#xD;
      attenuate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major event in aging is the loss of the central metabolite nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD+) that appear to be important in the proinflammatory environment that occur&#xD;
      during aging. Notably, recent work from our and other groups suggest that aging can be&#xD;
      ameliorated by even a short-term treatment of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside.&#xD;
      Nicotinamide riboside has recently been shown to be able to return aging tissues to a younger&#xD;
      state even after short term treatment. This vitamin B3- analog is naturally occurring, is&#xD;
      readily taken up through oral administration and has been tested in human trials with few&#xD;
      side effects. In this randomized double blinded case-control trial, the investigators will&#xD;
      treat elderly (&gt;70 year old) COVID19 patients with 1 g of nicotinamide riboside (NR-E) or&#xD;
      placebo for 2 weeks and investigate if this affects the clinical course of the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients are increasing worldwide and healthcare&#xD;
      systems are attempting to cope with the massive pressure that this pandemic results in. Given&#xD;
      the highly infectious virus and the relatively high mortality, this pandemic will likely&#xD;
      result in many thousand casualties. Interventions are direly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the early reports of the pandemic it quickly became apparent that mortality was&#xD;
      primarily attributed to the elderly population. Indeed, the mortality rate of young adults&#xD;
      was around 0.2% while elderly Covid-19 patients displayed a mortality rate of ~20%. Thus,&#xD;
      fatality rates increase ~100 fold when comparing young adults to elderly individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major event in aging is the loss of the central metabolite nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD+) that appear to be important in the proinflammatory environment that occur&#xD;
      during aging. Notably, recent work from our and other groups suggest that aging can be&#xD;
      ameliorated by even a short-term treatment of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside.&#xD;
      Nicotinamide riboside has recently been shown to be able to return aging tissues to a younger&#xD;
      state even after short term treatment. This vitamin B3- analog is naturally occurring, is&#xD;
      readily taken up through oral administration and has been tested in human trials with few&#xD;
      side effects. The purpose of this aim is to investigate if nicotinamide riboside can reduce&#xD;
      the severity of COVID-19 in patients aged 70 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly population is particularly problematic because long term respirator use for these&#xD;
      patients is connected with a substantial mortality risk. Interventions that can keep them&#xD;
      from fulminant respiratory failure is therefore of critical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Study treatment: Nicotinamide riboside Nicotinamide riboside (NR-E, supplied by Elysium&#xD;
      Health) is a naturally occurring vitamin B3 analog produced by yeast and found in multiple&#xD;
      food products at low concentration. Many organisms including humans cannot produce&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside but have evolved methods to convert this into the central redox&#xD;
      modulator NAD+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of nicotinamide riboside has been tested in a number of studies in&#xD;
      both healthy controls and in patients suffering from metabolic disease, a risk factor for an&#xD;
      adverse outcome of COVID-19 patients. Since this is a natural compound widely found in nature&#xD;
      no subjects have yet developed allergic responses to the molecule, and repeated doses of up&#xD;
      to 2 g orally per day have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No treatment-emergent adverse events have so far been reported for nicotinamide riboside&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Rationale NAD+ is emerging as a central metabolic molecule involved in multiple&#xD;
      age-related pathways including inflammation and metabolic control. Notably, 2 weeks&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside treatment increases metabolic output, normalizes muscle function and&#xD;
      reverses hypoxic responses in old mice. Recently, NAD+ has been shown to positively activate&#xD;
      the inflammatory response in various tissue and may be involved in polarizing macrophages&#xD;
      towards the M1 lineage and facilitate resolution of inflammation. Previously it was shown&#xD;
      that SARS-CoV-1 evades activation of the immune response and exogenous activation of&#xD;
      macrophages leads to a better outcome of SARS-CoV-1 infection. Thus, activation of elderly&#xD;
      macrophages via NAD+ replenishment could be an efficacious strategy in COVID-19 patients. In&#xD;
      addition, NAD+ replenishment may facilitate overall greater resilience of elderly patients&#xD;
      considering the anti-aging effects of nicotinamide riboside allowing these patients to better&#xD;
      cope with infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Rationale for study design and doses The purpose of this study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside supplementation can attenuate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.&#xD;
      The chosen dosage is 1 g per day given orally. This is lower than 2 g previously given to&#xD;
      healthy elderly individuals, however, this particular patient population have not been&#xD;
      treated with nicotinamide riboside previously so a slightly lower dose was chosen. In&#xD;
      addition, there is data suggesting that NAD+ regulates circadian rhythm and the dose is&#xD;
      therefore given in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is as follows: Elderly patients (&gt;70 years old) seen with suspected COVID-19&#xD;
      at Bispebjerg hospital that are not requiring oxygen therapy are subjected to a COVID-19&#xD;
      test. The patients will be asked if they want to participate in this trial. If the patients&#xD;
      agree and if the COVID-19 test is positive the patients will be randomized to either placebo&#xD;
      or 1g nicotinamide riboside daily. Previous work has shown an efficacious increase in NAD+&#xD;
      levels combined with better physiological outcomes after 2 weeks treatment in preclinical&#xD;
      trials. The investigators will therefore treat patients for 2 weeks total with a primary&#xD;
      outcome of the study being hypoxic respiratory failure as defined by needing oxygen therapy.&#xD;
      The patients will be evaluated in the ambulatory at day 7 and after the treatment ends at day&#xD;
      14. Follow up in the ambulatory will occur three months after enrollment. If a patient is&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital during the treatment period the treatment continues for the full two&#xD;
      weeks. To evaluate outcomes, untargeted metabolomics and the NAD-ome will be measured in&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) upon enrolment, at day 7 and immediately after&#xD;
      the study as well as at follow up three months later. Changes in the epigenetic landscape is&#xD;
      a strong biomarker of age and is affected by NAD+ and epigenetic evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      in the PBMCs. Next generation machine learning data analysis will be applied to identify&#xD;
      predictors of clinical outcome.&#xD;
