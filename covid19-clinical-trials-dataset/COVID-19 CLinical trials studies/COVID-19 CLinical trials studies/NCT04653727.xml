  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused a health emergency of international&#xD;
      proportions when it was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020.&#xD;
      Since then, the virus has spread internationally and the WHO has classified the outbreak as a&#xD;
      pandemic. In the context of the increasing reporting of this pandemic and the increasing&#xD;
      governmental measures to limit or slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by all means, there is&#xD;
      so far little scientific evidence for the effects of a healthy lifestyle on the disease. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare the potential of different, possibly protective lifestyles&#xD;
      using the example of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will conduct an online survey with 3.000&#xD;
      participants using mobile website technology.&#xD;
