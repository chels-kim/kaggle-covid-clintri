      A Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a treatment in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome caused by COVID-19 is a pilot phase, open label, non-randomized study, with a single&#xD;
      study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pandemic caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a health care crisis&#xD;
      affecting hospitals, hospital workers and health care structure globally. Many countries are&#xD;
      dealing with a disrupted infrastructure in health care and imminent economic downfall to an&#xD;
      extent that has not been seen in recent years. COVID-19 has lead to a large number of deaths&#xD;
      in several countries, and Mexico has not been an exception. Availability of supplies,&#xD;
      hospital space and equipment for mechanical ventilation are running critically low, and it&#xD;
      has been a challenge for hospitals coping with severe clinical symptoms in COVID-19. This&#xD;
      disease is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough and occasional diarrhea, and the severity&#xD;
      has been largely attributed to the high affinity of the virus to Angiotensin-Converting&#xD;
      Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main receptor, and the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease TMPRSS2&#xD;
      as the main host protease that mediates S protein activation on primary target cells in the&#xD;
      lung and small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many agencies and professional societies are working worldwide in developing treatment&#xD;
      guidelines to care for patients with COVID-19, since the present treatments are supportive&#xD;
      but not yet curative, therefore these guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert&#xD;
      opinion, the use of an array of drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple&#xD;
      investigational agents that are being studied. Lately, Remdesivir, a novel small-molecule&#xD;
      adenine nucleotide analogue antiviral drug that has shown efficacy against Ebola virus in&#xD;
      rhesus monkeys has shown improvement in patients with oxygen support. The focus of the&#xD;
      research for a cure of COVID-19 has been centered on the individual's response in an&#xD;
      immunological context, where an over activation of the immune response can cause a production&#xD;
      of a large quantity of inflammatory molecules resulting in a cytokine storm with severe&#xD;
      physiological consequences. The cytokine storm induces an increase in inflammatory proteins&#xD;
      that results in edema, improper oxygen exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),&#xD;
      other organ damage and secondary infection. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)&#xD;
      have proven to decrease the hyper inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to a steady&#xD;
      recovery in patients with ARDS. The use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs)&#xD;
      may prove a potential effective measure for the treatment of the cytokine storm induced by&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A step forward in a treatment strategy for the novel virus infection in humans would be&#xD;
      critical for treating COVID-19 and especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is&#xD;
      currently depleting resources around the world. Because efforts to control lung injury via&#xD;
      pharmacological agents have been unsuccessful, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy is&#xD;
      being investigated, based on the characteristics of MSCs to self-renew in a limitless manner&#xD;
      and their multipotency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, MSC-based therapies have demonstrated in the past of having sufficient promising&#xD;
      effects in experimental treatment of ARDS via inhibition of alveolar collapse, collagen&#xD;
      accumulation, and cell apoptosis in lung tissue. Recent studies found that administrating&#xD;
      allogeneic MSCs in patients with ARDS resulted in no pre-specified adverse events, including&#xD;
      hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia. MSCs are currently attracting&#xD;
      interest due to source potential, a high proliferation rate, and a painless procedure that is&#xD;
      free of ethical issues. Selection of a starting dose of approximately 100 million cells has&#xD;
      been chosen to approximate the standard dosage of cells employed in prior clinical studies.&#xD;
      This dosage may be adjusted depending on the data generated during the conduction of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and&#xD;
      differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or&#xD;
      make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. The immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects of MSCs are triggered further by the activation of TLR receptor in MSCs, which is&#xD;
      stimulated by pathogen-associated molecules such as LPS or double-stranded RNA from virus,&#xD;
      like the HCoV-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many pilot studies conducted with MSC transplantation to explore their therapeutic&#xD;
      potential for HCoV-19 infected patients, in many of them the pulmonary function and symptoms&#xD;
      of patients were significantly improved days after MSC transplantation. Thus, in this study&#xD;
      we intend to prove the intravenous transplantation of MSCs as safe and effective for&#xD;
      treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for patients in severe condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the feasibility and safety of intravenously administered MSCs&#xD;
      in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess preliminary response in respiratory performance in patients with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess overall survival of patients. To determine mortality rate at 14 days post&#xD;
      treatment. To assess clinical and radiological improvements in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects to be studied: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate Respiratory distress symptoms based on Berlin definition (RR; Oxygen saturation at&#xD;
      rest; Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / Fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the degree of ground-glass opacity and pneumonia infiltration in imaging studies&#xD;
      (X-ray or CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate clinical improvement based on APACHE II Score. Determine mortality rate at 2 weeks&#xD;
      post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events related to MSC infusion (description, timing, grade, seriousness, and&#xD;
      relatedness) Hematological decompensation (based on CBC, SQ and metabolic panels) Objective&#xD;
      response rate Progression free survival, overall survival, and best overall response rate&#xD;
      Determine if any infusion reactions/toxicity occurs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiological parameters will be assessed at Baseline, 2, 4 and 14 day&#xD;
      post-treatment, and there will be a 3 month follow-up by telephone contact.&#xD;
