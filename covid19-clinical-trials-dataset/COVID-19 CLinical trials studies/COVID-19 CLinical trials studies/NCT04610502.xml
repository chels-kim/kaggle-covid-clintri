  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reports of the use of plasma from convalescent patients and purified immunoglobulin&#xD;
      preparations in respiratory infections by various viral agents and SARS-CoV-2 in severely ill&#xD;
      patients suggest that specific neutralizing antibodies may benefit their clinical course.&#xD;
      During the previous SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, preparations of hyperimmune equine serum were&#xD;
      produced and demonstrated in vitro viral neutralization. These preparations were also&#xD;
      successful in several animal models. Taking advantage of the important trajectory of our&#xD;
      country in the study and use of equine hyperimmune serums with neutralizing antibodies for&#xD;
      snake venom, preparations of hyperimmune serums against recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      were produced through repeated immunization of horses, a first group of animals was&#xD;
      inoculated with the &quot;S&quot; (Spike) protein of the virus and the second group with a mixture &quot;M&quot;&#xD;
      of the S1 (Spike) proteins, the N (Nucleoprotein) protein and a construct with epitopes of&#xD;
      the S1, E (Envelope) and M (Membrane) proteins, generating two different pharmaceutical&#xD;
      preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of two hyperimmune equine serum anti-Sars-CoV-2&#xD;
      (&quot;S&quot; and &quot;M&quot;) formulations as an addition to the standard therapeutic approach for&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19 over 18 years of age with the presence of at least 2 risk&#xD;
      factors and a symptom onset period not exceeding 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 52 patients will be included and randomly divided into two balanced groups. On day&#xD;
      1, all participants from each group will receive an intravenous infusion containing 10ml (one&#xD;
      vial) of hyperimmune equine anti-Sars-CoV-2 serum labeled as A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated clinically, general laboratory, SARS-CoV-2 serologies, SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      viral load and cytokines level as well as pulmonary ultrasound. Data will be collected for&#xD;
      both groups on Days 0 to 7, 10 and 14 or discharge after completion of treatment. The study&#xD;
      will end for each participant on the day of discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
