  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to evaluate an innovative post-acute continuation/transition planning&#xD;
      treatment strategy that leveraged an in-person intensive treatment followed by online,&#xD;
      videoconferencing-based &quot;booster&quot; sessions for youth with selective mutism (SM). Twenty&#xD;
      children between the ages of 4 and 10 and their caregivers were scheduled to participate in&#xD;
      an in-person intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) for SM and subsequently randomized&#xD;
      to receive either (a) six, biweekly, hour-long, videoconferencing-delivered booster sessions&#xD;
      or (b) no additional treatment for 12 weeks. Due to COVID-19-related physical distancing&#xD;
      restrictions, the study team was unable to provide in-person services. Thus, the clinical&#xD;
      trial was converted to an open-trial design focused on evaluating remote treatment options&#xD;
      (i.e., remotely delivered caregiver training sessions and/or a remotely delivered IGBT) for&#xD;
      these families. All families retained in the study have or will participate(d) in assessments&#xD;
      at the following time points: Intake (i.e., 4-5 months prior to the remote IGBT); Baseline&#xD;
      (i.e., 1 month prior to the IGBT), Post-IGBT (i.e., 2 weeks following the IGBT), and School&#xD;
      Year Follow Up (i.e., 16 weeks following the IGBT).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after the Intensive Group Behavioral Treatment (IGBT)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I Scale (Guy &amp; Bonato, 1970) is a widely used global improvement measure; improvement is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Independent evaluators masked to family participation/progress during the intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) will complete the CGI-I rating. &quot;Treatment Response&quot; is defined as an independent evaluator rated CGI-I rating of 1 or 2 (ratings &gt;/= 3 represent &quot;Treatment Nonresponse&quot;).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after the Intensive Group Behavioral Treatment (IGBT)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996) is a well-supported semi-structured diagnostic interview assessing child mental disorders in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Disorders are assigned a clinical severity rating (CSR) along a 9-point scale ranging from 0-8 (CSRs &gt;/= 4 indicate diagnostic criteria were met). Independent evaluators masked to family participation/progress during the caregiver training program and/or intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) will administer the ADIS and determine CSRs.</description>
