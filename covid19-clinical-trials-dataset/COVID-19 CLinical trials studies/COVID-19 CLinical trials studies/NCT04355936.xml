  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications&#xD;
      similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002-2003 epidemic. This new disease&#xD;
      was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, enters the&#xD;
      airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in&#xD;
      type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a&#xD;
      partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in&#xD;
      turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its&#xD;
      degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7.&#xD;
      High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an&#xD;
      inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered&#xD;
      cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. It has recently been proposed the tentative use of&#xD;
      agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      prior to development of ARDS. The present study is an open-label randomized phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients. Briefly, patients with&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, will be randomized to receive 80 mg/12h of telmisartan&#xD;
      plus standard care or standard care alone aand will be monitored for development of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other variables regarding lung function&#xD;
      and cardiovascular function will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications&#xD;
      similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the 2002-2003 epidemic. This&#xD;
      new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 (Chen, Liu, &amp; Guo, 2020; Li&#xD;
      et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that vaccines against COVID-19 are still in development and an effective treatment&#xD;
      against this new coronavirus is lacking, various pharmacological agents are being tested in&#xD;
      clinical trials designed by institutions such as the WHO or scientific entities in different&#xD;
      countries (C.-C. Lu, Chen, &amp; Chang, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the characteristics of the mode of entry of this coronavirus to human&#xD;
      cells through binding with Angiotensin Converting Enzime 2 (ACE2) and extensive scientific&#xD;
      and clinical evidence information on the Renin Angiotensin System, the hypothesis of the&#xD;
      involvement of this system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 was born (Gurwitz, 2020;&#xD;
      Vaduganathan et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus, enters the airway and binds, by means of the S (Spike) protein on its&#xD;
      surface (after whose image the term coronavirus is coined), to the membrane protein ACE2 in&#xD;
      type 2 alveolar cells (R. Lu et al., 2020; Wan, Shang, Graham, Baric, &amp; Li, 2020). The S&#xD;
      protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis and facilitates the entry of each virion&#xD;
      into the cytoplasm. For each intracellular entry, the function of one ACE2 molecule is lost&#xD;
      leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar&#xD;
      cells of the lung directly related to the viral load of the air inoculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACE2 catalyzes the transformation of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin II&#xD;
      acting on AT1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, apoptosis, proinflammatory effects, and&#xD;
      fibrosis. Angiotensin 1-7 acting on Mas receptors causes opposite effects: vasodilation and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory. Partial decrease or total loss of ACE2 function in alveolar cells results&#xD;
      in a deviation of the homeostatic balance of the Renin Angiotensin System in favor of the&#xD;
      angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis (Paz Ocaranza et al., 2020; Tikellis, Bernardi, &amp; Burns,&#xD;
      2011). Indeed, it increases the tissue concentration of angiotensin II by decreasing its&#xD;
      degradation and reduces the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7(Liu&#xD;
      et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease will depend fundamentally on the degree of&#xD;
      alteration of the homeostatic balance of the Renin Angiotensin System in the lung and at the&#xD;
      systemic level (mainly at the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the effects of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis,&#xD;
      which, in turn, initiates an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      establishing a self-powered cascade (Cardoso et al., 2018). In certain patients this process&#xD;
      reaches such clinical relevance that requires external oxygen supply and in severe cases an&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) ensues (this correlates with an acute release&#xD;
      -storm- of cytokines) (Ware &amp; Matthay, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the aetiopathogenic hypothesis described, there are various pharmacotherapeutic&#xD;
      proposals to be evaluated through clinical trials: Recombinant ACE2 therapy, administration&#xD;
      of agents aimed at increasing ACE2 levels (e.g. estradiol), and administration of drugs that&#xD;
      decrease the elevated activity of angiotensin II including renin release inhibitors, classic&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor 1 Blockers (ARBs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients who develop COVID-19 disease initially have fever, indicative ofan inflammatory&#xD;
      process with systemic release of pyrogenic cytokines. According to the hypothesis described,&#xD;
      this inflammation is induced by the inhibition of ACE2 and the imbalance of the renin&#xD;
      angiotensin system in the pulmonary interstitium in favor of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor&#xD;
      axis. Faced with the onset of the inflammatory process, a rapidly effective treatment is&#xD;
      necessary to antagonize the cascading and self-sustaining phenomenon described. Of the&#xD;
      different types of drugs mentioned above, we consider that the most rapidly effective may be&#xD;
      ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Gurwitz (2020) proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and&#xD;
      telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARBs are widely used to treat hypertension and there is an abundant clinical experience with&#xD;
      its use, all representatives of this group being characterized by their excellent tolerance;&#xD;
      Furthermore, its adverse effects profile has been described as &quot;placebo like(Schumacher &amp;&#xD;
      Mancia, 2008; Sharpe, Jarvis, &amp; Goa, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most suitable ARB to antagonize the proinflammatory effects of angiotensin II in a&#xD;
      patient with a recent positive COVID-19 test should be the compound with the best&#xD;
      pharmacological properties for this indication. From the comparative analysis of the&#xD;
      available ARBs, telmisartan gathers properties that make it the best pharmacological tool to&#xD;
      evaluate the hypothesis under discussion in a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposolubility is relevant for absorption after oral administration and for tissue&#xD;
      penetration. Telmisartan stands out among all the representatives of the ARBs for being&#xD;
      markedly more lipophilic, expressed both in partition coefficients (octanol / neutral pH&#xD;
      buffer), distribution coefficients and distribution volumes (Vd). Telmisartan has a Vd of&#xD;
      approximately 500 L, irbesartan 93 L, and both valsartan and olmesartan, candesartan and&#xD;
      losartan, approximately 17 L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The affinity of ARBs for the AT1 receptor has been measured by multiple studies, mainly using&#xD;
      radioligand binding studies. All AT1 receptor blockers are characterized by having similar&#xD;
      affinity values (pKi or pIC50, between 2 and 19 nM), with losartan and its active metabolite&#xD;
      EXP3174 being the lowest and irbesartan, candesartan and telmisartan the highest (Kakuta,&#xD;
      Sudoh, Sasamata, &amp; Yamagishi, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using isolated organ technique on blood vessels from different tissues and from different&#xD;
      animals, these AT1 antagonists have a blocking power (pA2) against angiotensin II in the nM&#xD;
      range (losartan, 8.15; irbesartan, 8.52; valsartan, 9.26; telmisartan 9.48; candesartan,&#xD;
      10.08). Telmisartan has a 10-fold higher blocking potency than losartan (Kakuta et al.,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional as well as biochemical studies determining the dissociation rates of the ARBs have&#xD;
      shown that these drugs have a slow dissociation rate that gives them characteristics of&#xD;
      pseudo-irreversible blocking agents. In the only comparative study using cloned human AT1&#xD;
      receptors, the half-lives of receptor dissociation were: telmisartan, 213 min; olmesartan,&#xD;
      166 min; candesartan, 133 min; valsartan, 70 min; losartan, 67 min (Kakuta et al., 2005).&#xD;
      Telmisartan is the AT1 blocker that dissociates more slowly from the receptor. This property&#xD;
      may be clinically relevant as it maintains a longer lasting blockade difficult to reverse by&#xD;
      the endogenous agonist angiotensin II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, telmisartan causes downregulation of AT1 receptor at the mRNA and protein level&#xD;
      apparently due to its action as a partial agonist of PPAR-gamma (Peroxisome&#xD;
      Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma). This action can contribute to the effects of&#xD;
      telmisartan by producing a decrease in the number of AT1 receptors (Imayama et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, telmisartan, which is well absorbed after oral administration, is the ARB with&#xD;
      the longest plasma half-life (24 h), it reaches the highest tissue concentrations due to its&#xD;
      high lipid solubility and high volume of distribution (500 L), and dissociates more slowly&#xD;
      after binding to the AT1 receptor, causing an apparently irreversible block (Kakuta et al.,&#xD;
      2005; Michel, Foster, Brunner, &amp; Liu, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of&#xD;
      telmisartan in COVID-19 patients. Briefly, patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive 80 mg/12h of telmisartan (Bertel®, Laboratorio Elea Phoenix,&#xD;
      Buenos Aires, Argentina) plus standard care or standard care alone will be monitored for&#xD;
      development of systemic inflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other variables&#xD;
      regarding lung function and cardiovascular function will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies to evaluate the safety of Telmisartan in healthy individuals or in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with daily doses of up to 160 mg, found no difference between those&#xD;
      treated with telmisartan and the placebo group in frequency and intensity of adverse effects&#xD;
      (Schumacher &amp; Mancia, 2008; Sharpe et al., 2001; Stangier, Su, &amp; Roth, 2000).&#xD;
