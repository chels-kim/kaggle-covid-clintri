  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although clinical trials for approved COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated efficacy of the vaccine&#xD;
      in preventing symptomatic infection, many questions about vaccine effectiveness, such as the&#xD;
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing asymptomatic infection, a surrogate for&#xD;
      transmission, and duration of protection, can only be evaluated in real-world trials. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (Pfizer vaccine, and, if&#xD;
      available, Moderna vaccine) in preventing infection in healthcare personnel in Israel. HCP&#xD;
      who are Clalit members and working in Soroka, Beilinson, Meir, Haemek, Kaplan and Schneider&#xD;
      hospitals, 18 years or older, and eligible to get COVID-19 vaccine according to Ministry of&#xD;
      Health guidelines, will be recruited, regardless of their intention to get the COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine. A baseline serology sample and respiratory sample will be collected. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to provide a respiratory sample weekly for 3 months, and then monthly for the&#xD;
      remainder of the study. Participants will also have blood drawn at 1 month, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 9 months and 12 months. Respiratory samples will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR;&#xD;
      serology will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study will last for 12 months. For&#xD;
      each participant, data will be extracted from the Electronic Medical Record for the period of&#xD;
      the study and retrospectively from 2010.&#xD;
