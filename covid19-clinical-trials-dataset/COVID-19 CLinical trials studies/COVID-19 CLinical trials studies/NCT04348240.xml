      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and currently there is no effective therapy or vaccine.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 respiratory infection, appears to be very&#xD;
      contagious however all the modes of transmission are unclear. Transmission may occur in up to&#xD;
      25 percent of cases when there are no symptoms (asymptomatic). Before there are any symptoms,&#xD;
      droplet spray during speaking may increase transmission from person to person; most of the&#xD;
      spray is saliva. Researchers at the NIH would like to test saliva for the virus before&#xD;
      symptoms are reported. Additionally, they would like to examine the importance of using masks&#xD;
      to prevent transmission. They hope to better understand how COVID-19 is spread among people&#xD;
      and how it can be prevented. For this study they would like to collect samples from the nose&#xD;
      (nasopharyngeal swab), mouth (spit sample), eye (conjunctival fluid) and blood to test for&#xD;
      the virus and if it is contagious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is present in saliva in asymptomatic individuals who are&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive. To determine if using masks can prevent transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older without symptoms or with mild symptoms (e.g., low grade fever,&#xD;
&#xD;
      mild malaise, minor sore throat, runny nose, or sneezing) who have been in close contact&#xD;
      (e.g. live in the same house) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or people who&#xD;
      have tested positive for COVID-19 and have mild (e.g., low grade fever, mild malaise, minor&#xD;
      sore throat, runny nose, or sneezing) or no symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening, interested participants will contact a study team member. The interested&#xD;
      participant will be asked to provide documentation of COVID-19 positive status, their&#xD;
      symptoms, or their contact to a COVID-19 positive person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to come to the NIH drive-up COVID-19 testing site or NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center (Bethesda, MD) for 2 or more visits in 15 days for the following procedures: nasal&#xD;
      swab for COVID-19 and viral load, verbal symptom assessment, saliva collection, and speaking&#xD;
      exercise to capture oral fluid. During this time, participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      participate in phone calls with the study staff and to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      electronically. Participants will have weekly telephone calls to discuss their symptoms and&#xD;
      2-5 drive-up visits to the NIH within 28 days. If visits are scheduled at the Clinical&#xD;
      Center, participants will have the option to participate in providing blood sample(s), a&#xD;
      conjunctival swab and 1-2 salivary gland biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant has tested positive, they may be asked to return to the NIH after they have&#xD;
      recovered from COVID-19 for additional sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are part of this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speaking exercise - participants will be asked to read a short script with and without&#xD;
           wearing a mask. The droplets they produce while they speak will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection - participants will spit into a cup and have saliva collected from&#xD;
           different areas of the mouth. They should not eat 90 minutes before this but drinking&#xD;
           water or juice is acceptable. They may have their tongue painted with a sour liquid to&#xD;
           increase their saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal swab- participants will have a swab rubbed inside their nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasopharyngeal swab - participants that are close contacts of COVID-19 positive&#xD;
           individual(s) and need a COVID-19 test, will have a swab inserted through the nose to&#xD;
           rub the back of their throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires - participants will complete questionnaires about their symptoms&#xD;
           electronically at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are optional for participants to agree to participate in and will be&#xD;
      performed in the Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample(s) - participants will have blood collection via venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival swab - participants will have the inner lower eyelid wiped with swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minor salivary gland biopsy - participants will have tiny glands in mouth removed.&#xD;
           Procedure will be done in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be paid up to a total of $300 for the study, based on the number of visits&#xD;
      to NIH and the types of procedures performed. Payment will be: $50 on Day 1, Day 15 and at&#xD;
      the recovery visit. Participants who agree to the optional conjunctival swab and/or biopsy&#xD;
      will be paid $50 for each conjunctival swab (up to 1) and/or $50 for each salivary biopsy (up&#xD;
      to 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time the participants start to have moderate or severe respiratory symptoms, their&#xD;
      participation in the study will end and they should seek care with their local provider.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic without an effective therapy. A series of reports have&#xD;
      implicated that asymptomatic transmission occurs in at least 25% SARS-CoV-2 cases. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that droplet emission from oral fluids generated during speaking could be an&#xD;
      important and actionable factor driving asymptomatic transmission. We aim to collect oral and&#xD;
      nasal secretions, conjunctival fluid and blood to test for viral load and viral infectivity&#xD;
      in 1) asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic high-risk subjects with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status,&#xD;
      but with a history of close personal contact with a SARS-CoV-2 positive person and 2)&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects who are SARS-CoV-2 positive. 3) COVID-19 positive&#xD;
      individuals retesting as negative can be enrolled to complete the electronic questionnaire(s)&#xD;
      assessment and allow for evaluation of history of symptoms. 4) COVID-19 positive individuals&#xD;
      admitted to the NIH Clinical Center can be enrolled as a symptomatic comparison cohort.&#xD;
