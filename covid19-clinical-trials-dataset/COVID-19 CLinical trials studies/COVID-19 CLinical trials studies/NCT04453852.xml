  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to test a new vaccine (Covax-19) against COVID-19. COVID-19 is a potentially&#xD;
      deadly disease that is caused by a new strain of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. To date,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 4 million people worldwide resulted in the deaths of over three&#xD;
      hundred thousand people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human infections with zoonotic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS CoV)&#xD;
      and now 2019 SARS-CoV-2, all pose major human public health threats with high case fatality&#xD;
      rates. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, which shares high similarity with SARS-CoV in its viral&#xD;
      genome, has so far caused more than 4,736,000 cases worldwide (as of May 17, 2020) with&#xD;
      3131,545 deaths, resulting in an estimated overall mortality rate of 4-5%. It has a&#xD;
      particularly high mortality rate in elderly people and those with chronic disease. To fight&#xD;
      the current outbreak and prepare for future human outbreaks of similar coronaviruses,&#xD;
      development of a safe and effective SARS-COV-2 vaccine remains a high priority. The fatality&#xD;
      rate in the elderly is very high, being 8% for those over 70 and over 20% for those over 80.&#xD;
      Notably, over 16% of the Australian population is aged 65 or older. Currently there is no way&#xD;
      to control infection with SARS-COV-2 other than minimise exposure by social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a vaccine against COVID-19 would deliver major public health and economic&#xD;
      benefits for Australia, with potential to prevent numerous deaths, particularly among the&#xD;
      Australian elderly, reducing the burden on hospital ICUs, helping to alleviate public&#xD;
      concern, and ultimately allowing the Australian economy to return as fast as possible to&#xD;
      normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related enveloped, single positive-stranded RNA&#xD;
      viruses, with one genome encoding a non-structural replicase polyprotein and structural&#xD;
      proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. SARS&#xD;
      virus neutralizing antibodies were shown to be directed against the S protein. S protein can&#xD;
      be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by proteases and within the S1 subunit there is a&#xD;
      receptor-binding domain (RBD), which was shown to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2&#xD;
      (ACE2), which mediates SARS virus entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein similarly binds&#xD;
      ACE2 for cellular entry. Hence a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine that induces&#xD;
      neutralising antibody against the virus should be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection just&#xD;
      as seen for SARS CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-COV-2 vaccine design is best informed by previous experience with closely related SARS&#xD;
      CoV vaccines. Antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein blocks infection. When&#xD;
      recombinant SARS spike protein vaccines produced in insect cells were formulated with Advax&#xD;
      adjuvant, this enhances neutralizing antibody and T cell responses which translate into rapid&#xD;
      lung viral clearance. Based on experience with developing successful and safe SARS and MERS&#xD;
      vaccines, Covax-19 vaccine design is based on recombinant insect cell- expressed SARS-COV-2&#xD;
      spike protein formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant. The vaccine is based on recombinant&#xD;
      expression of the ecto-domain of spike protein in insect cells. Insect cell expression of&#xD;
      recombinant protein is a well characterised platform, allowing standardised procedures to be&#xD;
      rapidly transferred to other facilities around the world. In response to the 2009 H1N1&#xD;
      influenza pandemic, roll-out of a pandemic vaccine based on hemagglutinin protein was&#xD;
      extremely fast, with the first cGMP batches of vaccine produced within 6 weeks of virus&#xD;
      discovery, and the first human trial subject dosed at Flinders just under 3 months after&#xD;
      virus discovery . The use of Advax adjuvant doubled the seroconversion and seroprotection&#xD;
      rates while maintaining vaccine tolerability and safety. Recombinant proteins manufactured&#xD;
      using this method and formulated with Advax adjuvants have been found to be effective and&#xD;
      safe in multiple human trials, including of H1N1/2009 and H5N1 (NCT02335164) and H7N9&#xD;
      (NCT03038776) influenza vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covax-19 consists of highly purified recombinant SARS-COV-2 spike protein plus Advax-SM&#xD;
      adjuvant in a sterile solution for intramuscular injection. COVAX-19™ vaccine is manufactured&#xD;
      using a Sf9 platform. Advax-CpG adjuvant has previously been well tolerated and effective in&#xD;
      trials of hepatitis B, H5N1 (NCT02335164) and H7N9 (NCT03038776) influenza vaccines and has&#xD;
      recently been tested by the NIH in a US multicentre clinical trial with 2 quadrivalent&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccines (NCT03945825).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVAX-19™ vaccine is designed to elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 with generation&#xD;
      of neutralising antibodies against its spike protein that prevent the virus attaching to the&#xD;
      human ACE2 receptor in the respiratory epithelium. It is also designed to induce T cells&#xD;
      against the spike protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVAX-19 vaccine is safe and well tolerated in adult human subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVAX-19 vaccine will induce durable high titer neutralising antibodies and T cell&#xD;
           responses against SARS-COV-2 virus.&#xD;
