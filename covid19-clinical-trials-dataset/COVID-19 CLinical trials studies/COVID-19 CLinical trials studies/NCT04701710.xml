      IMPORTANCE: The emergency of COVID-19 requires the implementation of urgent strategies to&#xD;
      prevent the spread of the disease, mainly in health personnel, who are the most exposed and&#xD;
      has the highest risk of becoming infected with the SARS-COV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect of the combination Ivermectin - Iota-&#xD;
      Carrageenan, intensive treatment with repeated administration in oral- and nasal-spray,&#xD;
      respectively, as a prophylaxis treatment prior to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in health personnel&#xD;
      at Public Healthcare Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled 1-1 clinical trial in Personal&#xD;
      Health, n = 234. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG)and control groups (CG). The&#xD;
      EG received Ivermectin orally 2 drops of 6 mg = 12 mg every 7 days, and Iota-Carrageenan 6&#xD;
      sprays per day for 4 weeks. All participants were evaluated by physical examination COVID-19&#xD;
      diagnosed with negative RT-PCR at the beginning, final, and follow-up of the protocol.&#xD;
      Differences between the variables were determined using the Chi-square test. The proportion&#xD;
      test almost contagious subject and the contagion risk (Odd Ratio) were calculated using&#xD;
      software STATA. The level of statistical significance was reached when p-Value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

      The subjects were divided into experimental (EG: n=117; 39.6 +/- 9.4 years old, 65F) and&#xD;
      control groups (CG: n=117; 38.4 +/- 7.4 years old, 61F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULT: The number of subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in GE was lower, only 4 of&#xD;
      117 (3.4%) than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (p-Value = 0.0001). Twenty patients had&#xD;
      mild symptoms (n= 4 in EG, n= 16 in CG), the proportion test was p-Value = 0.001. Six&#xD;
      subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics, all them in CG. The probability (Odd&#xD;
      Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly lower in EG with values of 0.13 (CI =&#xD;
      [0.03, 0.40]; p-Value = 0.0001), this value (&lt;1) indicates a protective effect of the&#xD;
      Ivermectin / Iota-Carrageenan in the EG. Logistic regression test demonstrated that&#xD;
      prophylactic in EG is independent of the patient's preexisting variable comorbidity was 0.11,&#xD;
      CI= [0.04, 0.33], and p-Value= 0.0001. On the other hand, this variable was 2.78 CI= [1.19,&#xD;
      6.48], p-Value = 0.018 in CG. Also, we found that when increase the age variable, also&#xD;
      increases contagious risk for Covid-19 in all subjects 0,93 CI=[0.88, 0.98], p-Value= 0,0012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION: The intensive preventive treatment (short-term) with Ivermectin / Iota -&#xD;
      Carrageenan was able to reduce the number of health workers infected with COVID-19. This&#xD;
      treatment had an additional effect in preventing the severity of the disease, since most of&#xD;
      the patients who received the treatment were mild. We propose a new therapeutic alternative&#xD;
      for prevention and short-term intervention scheme (intensive) that is of benefit of the&#xD;
      health worker in this pandemic accelerated time. This treatment did not produce lack of&#xD;
      adherence or adverse effects.&#xD;
