      The FORECAST Study is an observational cohort study looking at two cohorts of patients&#xD;
      presenting with COVID-19: a general public cohort, aiming to investigate if new loss or&#xD;
      reduced sense of smell and/or taste are early signs of COVID-19 and a hospital cohort, which&#xD;
      will investigate if taste/smell changes can predict the clinical course of a COVID-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      The FORECAST Study is an observational cohort study looking at two cohorts of patients&#xD;
      presenting with COVID-19: a general public cohort, aiming to investigate if new loss or&#xD;
      reduced sense of smell and/or taste are early signs of COVID-19 and a hospital cohort, which&#xD;
      will investigate if taste/smell changes can predict the clinical course of a COVID-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main of objective of this study is to investigate whether loss/or reduced sense of smell&#xD;
      and/or taste in the absence of fever and/or persistent cough are indicative of Coronavirus&#xD;
      Infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In addition, the study aims to investigate&#xD;
      whether loss/or reduced sense of smell and/or taste precede the development of fever and&#xD;
      persistent cough in people with COVID-19 infection and also whether loss of/reduced sense of&#xD;
      smell and/or taste changes can be used to predict the clinical course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General public FORECAST: Participants over the age of 18 will be sent a text message invite&#xD;
      through participating GP practices' patient messaging systems. This will direct participants&#xD;
      to a website (hosted by Dendrite Clinical Systems) where study subjects will find the&#xD;
      participant information sheet, screening checks and consent form. Enrolled participants will&#xD;
      complete an online questionnaire containing questions about smell and taste changes, as well&#xD;
      as other symptoms of COVID-19. Participants will then be sent a near-patient rapid antibody&#xD;
      test kit for COVID-19 to be undertaken only under medical supervision. Participants will be&#xD;
      booked for a video conference appointment with either a doctor or nurse and the screening&#xD;
      test will be performed under medical supervision. The outcome of the test will be documented,&#xD;
      discussed with the patient and appropriate advice given. Four weeks after completing the&#xD;
      first questionnaire participant will be sent an email and / or text message asking them to&#xD;
      complete a second questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This second questionnaire will contain questions about resolution of smell/taste symptoms and&#xD;
      other symptoms of COVID-19. In case COVID-19 positive patients are subsequently admitted to&#xD;
      hospital as a result of COVID-19, consent will be obtained to collect information on the&#xD;
      outcome of the admission from discharge letter via GP. The data obtained will be analysed to&#xD;
      determine if smell/taste symptoms alone are indicative of COVID-19 infection, whether&#xD;
      smell/taste symptoms are early symptoms fo COVID-19 infection and whether smell/taste changes&#xD;
      can be used to predict the clinical course of COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital FORECAST: clinical records of patients admitted to University College London&#xD;
      Hospital (UCLH) and the Whittington Hospital as a result of COVID-19 will be reviewed. The&#xD;
      clinical notes of COVID-19 positive patients where absence or presence of smell/taste changes&#xD;
      have been documented will be selected for review. Anonymised clinical data will be collected&#xD;
      about symptoms on admission, the course of illness and outcomes. The study primary outcome&#xD;
      will be to compare case fatility rate in COVID-19 postivite with documented history of&#xD;
      loss/reduced sense of smell and/or taste compared to COVID-19 postive with documented history&#xD;
      of no loss/reduced sense of smell and/or taste. The study will investigate whether&#xD;
      loss/reduced sense of smell and/or taste can predict the course of illness and outcomes in&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
