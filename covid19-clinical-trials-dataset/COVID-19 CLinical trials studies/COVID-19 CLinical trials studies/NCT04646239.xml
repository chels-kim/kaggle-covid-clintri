    <textblock>
      This is a substudy of NCT04333732. The goal of this sub-study is to identify and characterize&#xD;
      biomarkers of trained immunity by measuring, in vitro, immune responses to heterologous&#xD;
      products, especially viral associated products, in the MMR vaccinated and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this sub-study will have two blood draws. One at baseline, prior to injection&#xD;
      of the NCT04333732 study drug, and one around day 30 following injection of said study drug.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A sub-study of the CROWN CORONATION Trial (COVID-19 Research Outcomes Worldwide Network for&#xD;
      CORONAvirus prevenTION; NCT04333732). The goal of this sub-study is to identify and&#xD;
      characterize biomarkers of trained immunity by measuring, in vitro, immune responses to&#xD;
      heterologous products, especially virally associated products, in those exposed to MMR&#xD;
      vaccine injection and those exposed to 0.9% sodium chloride ('normal saline') placebo&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected from participants prior to MMR / Placebo injection and again&#xD;
      around 30 days following injection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) will be&#xD;
      isolated from samples and stimulated with heterologous products (for example; Roswell Park&#xD;
      Memorial Institute medium [RPMI; negative control], MMR [the vaccine itself as specific&#xD;
      stimulus], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2; heat inactivated],&#xD;
      influenza virus [heat inactivated], toll-like receptor 3 ligand [TLR3 ligand; poly I:C],&#xD;
      toll-like receptor 7/8 ligand [TLR7/8 ligand; R848], toll-like receptor 4 ligand [TLR4&#xD;
      ligand; lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]). Supernatants will be assayed by multiplex luminex protein&#xD;
      assay at 24 hr (for example; type I interferons [IFN], interleukin [IL]-1β , IL-6, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor [TNF]-α) and after 5 days (for example; IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, IL-10). This&#xD;
      process of testing stimulus-response will be conducted on both the baseline and day 30&#xD;
      samples, collected from both the MMR and Placebo groups.&#xD;

        The CROWN CORONATION trial enrolls adults at risk of developing COVID-19 due to their work&#xD;
        in the healthcare environment. To be eligible, prospective participants for the CROWN&#xD;
        CORONATION trial must not have a contra-indication to receiving the live attenuated&#xD;
        Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR) and must not be exposed to agents that may&#xD;
        complicate the interpretation of findings regarding the hypothesized protective effect of&#xD;
        MMR for the prevention of COVID-19. The sub-study will consecutively approach all&#xD;
        participants enrolled in the CROWN CORONATION trial to elicit enrolment in the sub-study&#xD;
        cohort.&#xD;
