  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut immune system was shown as an effective target for inducing systemic immune signals&#xD;
      against viruses. Oral administration of Travelan, an over the counter product which contains&#xD;
      hyperimmune bovine colostrum was shown in preclinical studies to augment the anti-viral&#xD;
      immune towards several strains of influenza viruses (RNA viruses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the option that Trevalan may help improve the immune system reaction&#xD;
      when introduced to COVID-19 proteins in-vitro. 5 healthy volunteers will receive a treatment&#xD;
      regimen of 5 days with Trevalan. Before and after treatment, blood samples will be taken in&#xD;
      order to test immune response towards viral proteins of the COVID-19 virus in vitro by&#xD;
      measuring the number of T cell clone secreting IFNγ against viral antigens.&#xD;

          3. Females of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant (as determined by a serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening and again, prior to each dosing session) and agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraceptive means throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to adhere to the visit schedule and protocol requirements and be&#xD;
             available to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must provide written informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Acute illness resulting in emergency department (ED) evaluation or hospitalization in&#xD;
             the last 6 month or any acute illness in the last month before enrollment&#xD;
