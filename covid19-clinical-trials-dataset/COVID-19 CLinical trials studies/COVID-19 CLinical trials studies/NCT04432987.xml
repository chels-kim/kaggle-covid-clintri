    <textblock>
      In this study, the effectiveness of the Dornase Alpha treatment, which is known to reduce the&#xD;
      viscosity of respiratory secretions, will be investigated in new diagnosed and severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients separately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies confirmed the role of immune hyperactivation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.&#xD;
      Immune cells, especially neutrophils, infiltrate pulmonary capillaries that cause acute&#xD;
      fibrin deposition and extravasation into the alveolar space. This excessive accumulation of&#xD;
      neutrophils constitutes NETs which makes the mucus thick and viscous. The highly viscous&#xD;
      mucus lowers the patient's respiratory function and impairs ventilation supporting NETs may&#xD;
      play a major role in the disease. As a mechanism, double-stranded DNA constitutes the&#xD;
      backbone of NETs and Dornase alfa promotes the clearance of NETs from plasma neutralization.&#xD;
      Endogenous Deoxyribonucleases (DNases), which physiologically break up this extracellular&#xD;
      DNA, may become overwhelmed by a massive influx of NETs. Clinically, recombinant human DNase&#xD;
      I (rhDNase, Dornase Alfa) has the identical primary amino acid sequence with the native human&#xD;
      enzyme and has been approved for the management of cystic fibrosis. Daily administration of&#xD;
      dornase alfa is effective in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients improving pulmonary&#xD;
      functions. The similarity of mucus secretions in COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis patients by the&#xD;
      means of NETs makes Dornase alfa as a therapeutic option in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive COVID-19 pneumonia may be mortal if it is not treated early, causing respiratory&#xD;
      failure. The most important factor leading to respiratory failure is hyaline membrane formed&#xD;
      by a neutrophil trap that develops in the cavities of the alveoli. Dornase Alpha is thought&#xD;
      to have an important contribution by the lysis of this hyalen membrane. In this study, it is&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Dornase Alpha treatment in case of early and late use&#xD;
      in COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 PCR and / or radiological-clinical findings is included in&#xD;
      the study, and this treatment is carried out in 2 patient groups in comparison with the&#xD;
      control groups. The groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Newly Diagnosed Patient Group I. Dornase Alpha treated group ii. Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Group Monitored by Mechanical Ventilation I. Dornase Alpha treated group ii.&#xD;
           Control group&#xD;
