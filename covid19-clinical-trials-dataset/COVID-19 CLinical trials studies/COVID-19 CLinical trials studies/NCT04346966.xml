  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) exploded in Wuhan (Hubei, China)&#xD;
      and spread rapidly from one city to the whole world. This virus resulted in a total of&#xD;
      1679720 confirmed cases and 101734 deaths worldwide. All countries in the world are taking&#xD;
      some precautions to prevent the spread of this epidemic disease, which World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) declared as &quot;epidemic&quot;. Staying home and social isolation are among these&#xD;
      precautions. For this purpose, it began to implement the curfew for all individuals on 10&#xD;
      March 2020, Turkey. However, not leaving the house and social isolation bring about the&#xD;
      limitation of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) is defined as anybody's movement&#xD;
      produced by WHO by contraction of skeletal muscles. Studies investigating the relationship&#xD;
      between social isolation and health behavior report consistent findings. Individuals with&#xD;
      smaller social networks report less healthy diets, excessive alcohol consumption, and less&#xD;
      physical activity. Traditional exercises; It takes place outdoors in gyms or rehabilitation&#xD;
      centers. However, with the increase in the time we spent at home due to the coronavirus&#xD;
      (COVID-19) epidemic, technologies have been used as an alternative method. Home-based&#xD;
      exercise programs are also a viable solution to prevent various health problems that may be&#xD;
      encountered in this direction. The decrease in physical performance is associated with loss&#xD;
      of muscle strength, low quality of life, emotionalization, comorbidity, premature death, and&#xD;
      increased health costs. When today's conditions are evaluated, technology-supported education&#xD;
      programs are effective in increasing motivation for physical support. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study; To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, to evaluate the physical activity&#xD;
      levels of individuals between the ages of 18-40 who have social isolation due to the measures&#xD;
      taken in our country and to investigate the effectiveness of their video-based exercises.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary life invites various diseases. Especially cardiovascular diseases are the leading&#xD;
      ones. Researches show that the rapid development of technology has pushed people to laziness&#xD;
      and therefore to immobility. A sedentary lifestyle causes many serious health problems. Many&#xD;
      diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases, which are characterized as contemporary&#xD;
      diseases, such as muscular weakness, postural disorder, and diabetes are more common in&#xD;
      immobile and sedentary individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that still life has some drawbacks. These may cause tissue injuries between the&#xD;
      vertebrae and kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis problems, respectively. It may also cause&#xD;
      calcification in the lumbar vertebrae, disc problems, risk of sciatica, and an increase in&#xD;
      excess adipose tissue under the skin. Again high blood cholesterol and triglyceride findings&#xD;
      and blood sugar abnormalities may occur in the blood table. Of course, the susceptibility to&#xD;
      high blood pressure, the loss of elasticity of the rib cage, low respiratory capacity, and&#xD;
      the risk of coronary vascular disease may be uncertain. Still life can create weak abdomen&#xD;
      and back muscles, posture disorder, digestive and excretion difficulties, postpartum drooping&#xD;
      abdomen, hip slope abnormality, loss of strength, flexibility and functionality in all muscle&#xD;
      and muscle groups, weight problem and formlessness. Also in skeleton structure; osteoporosis,&#xD;
      calcification, joint problems, easy injury, weak body, easy sickness and recovery can be&#xD;
      observed. All these diseases are serious health problems that can be encountered in&#xD;
      individuals who do not exercise regularly. In many developed countries of the world, people&#xD;
      have included sports in many compulsory habits such as eating, drinking, lying, education,&#xD;
      and worship. This compulsory exercise is a lifelong activity in humans. People who make it&#xD;
      compulsory to exercise will feel discomfort as soon as they do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment, we know that the most valid method to protect against coronavirus is to stay&#xD;
      at home. Many scientists are told that this virus protection is to strengthen the immune&#xD;
      system through exercise, and that the weight problem can be eliminated with exercise due to&#xD;
      staying at home all day long. Because, it is explained one by one that exercise will increase&#xD;
      the body resistance of the people, children and adults will stay away due to movement from&#xD;
      obesity, the skeletal-muscular system will be regular, and the social environment will make&#xD;
      people healthier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, constant home, restricted mobility and freedom, limited sociability, decreased&#xD;
      communication, increased social-physical distance with our loved ones, and decreased physical&#xD;
      contact can make us more depressed, angry and anxious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, the home quarantine process created due to the Corona virus&#xD;
      necessitates exercise. We believe that this process can be managed in the most effective way&#xD;
      with video exercise and information booklets in order to reduce inactivity in this process,&#xD;
      which is left at home with the philosophy of life is movement, movement is life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Science and technology have been developing since the day human beings existed. Technology;&#xD;
      It is used in many fields such as education, health, communication, defense, industry and&#xD;
      transportation. Technology has brought many benefits and a new perspective to the health&#xD;
      sector as well as other fields. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of the&#xD;
      exercise program that we applied remotely with video-based exercises during the quarantine&#xD;
      days on the parameters such as physical activity level, balance, endurance, sleep quality,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older adult. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The client self rates each of these seven areas of sleep. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale.&#xD;
A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>

    <measure>Sit And Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sit and reach test is a common measure of flexibility, and specifically measures the flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles. This test involves sitting on the floor with legs stretched out straight ahead. Shoes should be removed. The soles of the feet are placed flat against the box. Both knees should be locked and pressed flat to the floor - the tester may assist by holding them down. With the palms facing downwards, and the hands on top of each other or side by side, the subject reaches forward along the measuring line as far as possible. Ensure that the hands remain at the same level, not one reaching further forward than the other. After some practice reaches, the subject reaches out and holds that position for at one-two seconds while the distance is recorded. Make sure there are no jerky movements.</description>
