    <textblock>
      The first period of COVID 19 Lockdown Measures (From 18 March to 11 may 2020) change the&#xD;
      French people way of life and their medicine knowledges. A study which evaluates the Nancy's&#xD;
      Pediatric emergencies population utilization during this time could detect pathological&#xD;
      changes. The medical impact of Home Confinement will show an increase (trauma, maltreatment)&#xD;
      or decrease (virus disease) of several pathology. The study aims to help clinicians to the&#xD;
      children care if another time of Home Confinement happened. The main objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the behavioural changes and the reason consultation in Nancy's Pediatric Emergencies from 18&#xD;
      March to 30 June 2020 comparate to the same time in 2019. We will continue the search after&#xD;
      the end of Home Confinement until 30 June 2020 to evaluate what happened just after.&#xD;
