      The purpose of this study is to characterize the incidence and clinical features of the&#xD;
      maternal COVID 19 infection, as well as the associated morbidity of the mother and the child,&#xD;
      in the French context&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the overall context of uncertainty about the morbidity associated with COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      and its optimal management, knowledge is urgently required on infection during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, pregnant women and newborns can have specific and severe reactions to infectious&#xD;
      diseases, as seen in previous pandemics which justifies targeted surveillance. Second,&#xD;
      optimal management must minimize the health risks of transmission to the newborn. While&#xD;
      initial studies did not provide evidence for transmission in utero or during delivery, more&#xD;
      recent data suggest that transmission is possible. The virus is present in vaginal secretions&#xD;
      and stool, making vertical contamination possible during vaginal delivery. Similarly,&#xD;
      transmission may occur during breastfeeding. These risks, which remain theoretical, must be&#xD;
      weighed against known harmful consequences of mitigating strategies such as systematic&#xD;
      caesarean (increase in maternal morbidity) and separating the child from the mother and&#xD;
      contraindicating breastfeeding (negative impact on maternal-child bonding and optimal&#xD;
      nutrition). In the absence of reliable data, some maternity hospitals have adopted a maximum&#xD;
      precautionary principle, recommending caesarean for all COVID-19 positive women and imposing&#xD;
      immediate mother-child separation after childbirth. These approaches are strongly debated in&#xD;
      France. Third, optimal management of COVID-19 during pregnancy requires balancing maternal&#xD;
      and newborn risks. Risks of maternal deterioration in the event of continuing pregnancy must&#xD;
      be weighed against those to the child resulting from indicated preterm birth. This tradeoff&#xD;
      is even more complex as evidence-based interventions to protect preterm infants, such as&#xD;
      antenatal corticosteroid, may aggravate maternal infection. Finally, childbirth is not an&#xD;
      elective procedure and requires managing large numbers of healthy women and newborns in a&#xD;
      hospital setting where they are exposed to risks of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population-based research that captures the diversity of organizational structures and&#xD;
      practices within maternity units is needed to guide management during the current epidemic&#xD;
      and draw lessons for future infectious pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal innovative features are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A population-based approach: Current data systems will include a limited number of&#xD;
           pregnant women, principally from university hospitals with specific patient populations&#xD;
           and management strategies. Because all maternity hospitals care for COVID-19+ pregnant&#xD;
           women, a population-based approach is needed to calculate reliable incidence rates,&#xD;
           assess practice variability and measure the impact of differences in management on&#xD;
           maternal and newborn infection rates and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inclusion of infected pregnant women who are not hospitalized and who recover before&#xD;
           delivery will provide comprehensive data and measure early fetal in-utero exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate feedback to clinicians on their practices will inform current controversies&#xD;
           about optimal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Joint follow-up of mother and child to 12 weeks after delivery, and longer if indicated,&#xD;
           will document the medium-term impact of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion of regions with time-varying exposure to the epidemic will provide information&#xD;
           to evaluate public health policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will make it possible to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. guide care for COVID-19 + mothers and their newborns in real time, through a targeted&#xD;
           analysis of key minimum data items, on a bimonthly basis during the epidemic. To achieve&#xD;
           this objective, rapid deployment of the data collection system is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. generate knowledge on the morbidity profile of maternal COVID-19 infection for mother&#xD;
           and child, the subgroups at risk, and the impact of management options in real life&#xD;
           settings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. document risks of intrapartum, peri-partum and postpartum transmission based on viral&#xD;
           tests performed in the course of routine care; this approach is complementary to the&#xD;
           biological collections set up in other projects, which aim to determine the infectious&#xD;
           status of pregnant women from specialized centers that are not representative of the&#xD;
           general population of pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. carry out comparative international research through collaboration with the&#xD;
           international INOSS network which is coordinating similar data collection protocols and&#xD;
           designs worldwide. The investigators are French INOSS partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. evaluate the impact of the epidemic on the organization of care for all pregnant women&#xD;
           and newborns. Major and rapid changes to prenatal and childbirth care have been made in&#xD;
           response to the epidemic, including spacing out consultations, using teleconsultation&#xD;
           instead of in-person visits, restricting the presence of relatives and early discharge.&#xD;
           These changes may induce negative consequences, notably delays in the diagnosis of&#xD;
           obstetrical complications. It is therefore crucial to document the impact of the&#xD;
           epidemic and the resulting measures on the health of all women and newborns. For all&#xD;
           pregnant women and newborns monitored in participating maternity hospitals, we will&#xD;
           extract routinely collected data from the computerized records of the maternity&#xD;
           hospitals and/or via the SNDS-PMSI databases. These data will also be collected for&#xD;
           periods before the epidemic to enable comparisons with overall pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
           between the two periods. These results can be placed in an international context through&#xD;
           collaboration with the European Euro-Peristat network, coordinated by the investigators'&#xD;
           research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multi-regional population-based cohort is to assess the impact of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal health, including rates of&#xD;
      perinatal transmission and the influence of diverse management practices on morbidity. The&#xD;
      study's focus on this specific population and its population-based coverage complement other&#xD;
      facility-based surveillance systems on all cases in France.&#xD;
