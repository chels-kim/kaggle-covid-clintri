  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease is of an urgent global priority. The purpose of ImmuneSense™ COVID-19&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the clinical performance and to provide data for clinical validation for&#xD;
      the T-Detect™ SARS-CoV-2 (previously referred to as immunoSEQ Dx SARS-CoV-2) Assay in support&#xD;
      of Adaptive's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) request for T-Detect™ SARS-CoV-2 and&#xD;
      secondary aims. This assay is intended to detect immune response to the virus that causes&#xD;
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2. This is critically important because the immune&#xD;
      system may be able to tell us important information about how our own bodies detect and&#xD;
      respond to the disease that current tests cannot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive diagnostic testing has an important role to play in the control and containment&#xD;
      of the current pandemic. Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (Adaptive) has developed an&#xD;
      immunosequencing technology, called immunoSEQ®, which utilizes polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify and quantify rearranged T-cell&#xD;
      receptor (TCR) gene sequences from peripheral blood, collectively referred to as the T-cell&#xD;
      repertoire. The T-cell repertoire can be further analyzed using indication-specific&#xD;
      algorithms that are based on disease-associated TCR sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive has developed a clinical test called T-Detect™ SARS-CoV-2, which is intended to&#xD;
      identify a T-cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, indicating recent or prior infection. In&#xD;
      this investigational study, Adaptive plans to clinically validate samples acquired from&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 and present results for an eventual EUA-submission for the T-Detect™&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 Assay. T-Detect™ SARS-CoV-2 is a single-site assay performed at Adaptive&#xD;
      Biotechnologies Corporation.&#xD;

             requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
