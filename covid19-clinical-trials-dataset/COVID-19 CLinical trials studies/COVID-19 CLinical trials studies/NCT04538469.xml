  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are part of a family network. When any person in a family becomes critically unwell&#xD;
      and requires the assistance of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), this has an impact on all&#xD;
      members of that family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 changed visiting for all patients in hospitals across Scotland. It is not known what&#xD;
      effect these restrictions will have on patients' recovery, nor do we understand the impact it&#xD;
      may have on their relatives or staff caring for them. This study will look at the&#xD;
      implications of the visiting restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic upon&#xD;
      patients without COVID-19 who are in the cardiothoracic ICU. It will also explore the impact&#xD;
      of these restrictions on them, their relatives and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out within a single specialised intensive care unit in Scotland&#xD;
      using mixed methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first arm of this study will use retrospective data that is routinely collected in normal&#xD;
      clinical practice. The investigators will compare patient outcomes prior to COVID-19 with&#xD;
      outcomes following the implementation of COVID-19 visiting restrictions. The aim is to&#xD;
      establish if the restrictions on visiting has an impact on the duration of delirium. Delirium&#xD;
      is an acute mental confusion and is associated with longer hospital stays and worse outcomes&#xD;
      in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second arm of this study involves semi-structured interviews with patients, relatives and&#xD;
      staff that will allow deeper exploration of the issues around current visiting policy. The&#xD;
      interviews will last approximately 1 hour and will address these issues. They will then be&#xD;
      transcribed word for word and analysed using grounded theory, meaning the theories will&#xD;
      develop from the data as it is analysed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will look at the implications of visiting restrictions on patients without&#xD;
      COVID-19 who are in the intensive care unit. It will also explore the impact of these&#xD;
      restrictions on them, their relatives and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the restriction of visiting has a negative impact on&#xD;
      recovery of patients, families of patients and staff caring for patients without COVID-19 in&#xD;
      the cardiothoracic ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer this hypothesis, the wider implications of COVID-19 will be explored, not&#xD;
      only with patients, but also relatives and staff involved in the care of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions this study aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a negative impact on the clinical outcomes due to the COVID-19 visitation&#xD;
           restrictions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there an increase in the incidence and duration of delirium in patients who do not&#xD;
           receive visitors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What experiences do patients recall during their ICU admission through the COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic visitation restrictions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What experiences do relatives recall from their loved-ones during an ICU admission&#xD;
           during the COVID-19 pandemic visitation restrictions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What impact, if any, do the changes to visiting have on staff?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer these research questions the investigators will carry out a single centre&#xD;
      mixed method observational study. This study will consist of two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first arm of this study will utilise retrospective data that is routinely collected in&#xD;
      normal clinical practice in this single centre. This will be used to compare to patient&#xD;
      outcomes prior to COVID-19 with outcomes following the implementation of COVID-19 visiting&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second arm of this study involves semi-structured interviews with patients, relatives and&#xD;
      staff that allow deeper exploration of the issues around current visiting policy.&#xD;

    <description>Visitation to patients in hospitals in Scotland was ceased due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Slow reintroduction of visitors has been introduced, however not to the pre COVID 19 levels. This study will examine the effects of these restrictions on patients in the cardiothoracic critical care unit that do not suffer from COVID 19.</description>
