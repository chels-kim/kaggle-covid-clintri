    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will enroll subjects with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by laboratory testing and who are in severe or&#xD;
      critical condition as indicated by life-support measures. Prior to protocol procedures,&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a screening evaluation to determine eligibility based on the protocol&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to determine the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      intravenously infused CAP-1002 in improving clinical outcomes in severely or critically ill&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to either the CAP-1002 or placebo group (1:1 ratio) and&#xD;
      undergo baseline safety and efficacy assessments approximately 1 to 5 days prior to the&#xD;
      administration of investigational product (IP). Treatment administration consists of IP&#xD;
      consisting of 150M CDCs or matching placebo on study Day 1. Background standard of care&#xD;
      treatment and practices will be maintained for all patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete Screening followed by a Treatment and Follow-up phase. A detailed&#xD;
      medical history will be collected, including the presence of any co-morbidities and risk&#xD;
      factors believed to be associated with COVID-19 outcomes or emergent factors since the time&#xD;
      of infection. Eligibility must be reviewed and confirmed on Day 1 prior to the infusion of&#xD;
      IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be observed during the index hospitalization and monitored for outcome and&#xD;
      safety with vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation), physical examinations, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory testing including&#xD;
      complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, inflammatory markers and adverse&#xD;
      events. Blood samples will be collected and submitted to a central laboratory for future&#xD;
      proteomic assay assessment. Use of any concomitant medications to treat COVID-19 will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be conducted on Days 2, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 either in the inpatient&#xD;
      setting or by telephone if the subject has been discharged. All subject participation will be&#xD;
      a maximum of 13 weeks from Screening.&#xD;

    <description>The active pharmaceutical ingredient in CAP-1002 is Cardiosphere-Derived Cells (CDCs). CDCs are known to secrete numerous bioactive elements (growth factors, exosomes) which impact the therapeutic benefits of the cell-based therapy. The mechanism of action is the composite ability to be immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic and regenerative.</description>
