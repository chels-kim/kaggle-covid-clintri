      The study 'Survival rates and long-term outcomes for patients with COVID-19 admitted to&#xD;
      Norwegian ICUs' is a national observational study, including patients admitted to a Norwegian&#xD;
      ICU between March 2020 and March 2021. The study will describe survival rates, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and health challenges experienced by survivors the first year after ICU&#xD;
      admission caused by COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study 'Survival rates and long-term outcomes for patients with COVID-19 admitted to&#xD;
      Norwegian ICUS' has two different aims. The first aim is to synthesis data from a National&#xD;
      register (Norwegian Intensive care register-NIR) on all COVID-19 patients in Norway admitted&#xD;
      to an ICU. These results are of great public interest for many reasons. First of all, it will&#xD;
      give us information on the severity of this novel virus, but also how the health care system&#xD;
      has coped in treating the severe cases that was admitted to an ICU. The results will&#xD;
      potentially be compared to other patient populations with viral pneumonia, but most&#xD;
      interestingly to survival rates from other countries. In addition, the data will give us a&#xD;
      description on how the distribution of severe cases of COVID-19 have been within Norway&#xD;
      (e.g., gender, age, health regions etc.) The second aim of this study is to measure and&#xD;
      describe health related challenges COVID-19 patients may experience during their first year&#xD;
      from ICU admission. The health-related domains that will be investigated will capture both&#xD;
      mental, physical and cognitive health. Knowledge from other patient population admitted to an&#xD;
      ICU with acute respiratory failure, indicates that these are the main domains that negatively&#xD;
      affect the activity of daily living. Physical, mental and cognitive health challenges will be&#xD;
      investigated for the Norwegian COVID -19 population admitted to ICU, and will give important&#xD;
      insight to the impact COVID-19 can have on survivors of severe cases, as well as the need for&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
