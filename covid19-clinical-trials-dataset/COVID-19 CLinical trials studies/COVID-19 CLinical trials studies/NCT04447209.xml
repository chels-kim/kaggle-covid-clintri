  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the&#xD;
      disease. Quarantine measures during a public health pandemic can be particularly detrimental&#xD;
      to urban poor families and affect the dietary diversity and food security. This can&#xD;
      disproportionately affect young children aged 6 and below, and severely impact those &lt;2&#xD;
      years. Sudden unemployment may result in an unexpected reduction in income that will place&#xD;
      pressure on daily budgets for food. Children of families may not have access to foods of&#xD;
      adequate diversity that will enable them to meet their macro and micronutrient requirements&#xD;
      for growth and development, especially during the Movement Control Order (MCO). The study&#xD;
      plans to monitor and evaluate dietary diversity in young children's food intake after the MCO&#xD;
      and use the collected information to direct targeted food aid to address observed macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies among the urban vulnerable group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children are the future to our society. The first thousand days of life, starting from&#xD;
      conception till one's second birthday is a critical period of cognitive and physical&#xD;
      development. It is the most sensitive period where brain development is most receptive to&#xD;
      positive nutrition. Any form of malnutrition, especially during this golden time frame, can&#xD;
      lead to irreversible effects to growth, health, education and future career attainment to our&#xD;
      potential leaders, which in turn can be a barrier to human development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoVID outbreak is a unique period in recent human history where drastic public health&#xD;
      measures such as MCO for an extended period of time has to be implemented nation-wide. These&#xD;
      measures have untold severe consequences on the food security of the vulnerable urban group,&#xD;
      in particular the young children whose brains require diverse micronutrients to support the&#xD;
      rapid growth. These micronutrients can only be obtained from a daily diet that is equally&#xD;
      diverse, especially from fresh vegetables and fruits which will be short in supplies. These&#xD;
      perishable food items are not usually included in food aids, thus the child may have to&#xD;
      subsist on staple-rich diet which are energy-dense but nutrient-poor. These dietary practices&#xD;
      are associated with negative health outcomes. Thus by monitoring dietary diversity of the&#xD;
      children, we hope to better inform food aid organisations to consider the inclusion of&#xD;
      healthier food options to prevent micronutrient deficiencies.&#xD;
