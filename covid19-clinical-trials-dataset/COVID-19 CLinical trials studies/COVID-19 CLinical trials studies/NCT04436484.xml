  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new virus to humans, first identified in December 2019, is causing a global pandemic with&#xD;
      over 1 million infections and many thousands of deaths. The virus, SARS-CoV2, leads to&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which mainly affects the breathing system. Around 1 in&#xD;
      every 5 people with COVID-19 have more severe infection needing treatment in hospital. Up to&#xD;
      half of them require help with breathing in an intensive care unit. Information we have so&#xD;
      far about COVID-19 suggests that people with underlying conditions, such as high blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart disease, or older people are at higher risk of having severe illness.&#xD;
      Scientists do not yet understand why but think it may be related to the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV2 activates the immune system causing inflammation in the lungs, which is also seen&#xD;
      in circulating immune cells in the blood. Preliminary reports show that the response of the&#xD;
      immune system can be inappropriate, both overactive and also poorly responsive (exhausted).&#xD;
      Changes in the type and function of immune cells have been linked to increased risk of severe&#xD;
      disease or death from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will look for markers of immune function when a person first&#xD;
      attends hospital, which can be used to predict whether they will go on to have a more severe&#xD;
      infection. This will help treat patients more effectively, for example, by moving high risk&#xD;
      patients to an intensive care setting at an early stage. The team will investigate the immune&#xD;
      system in detail in 200 patients with COVID-19 attending University Hospitals Plymouth. The&#xD;
      investigators will look for changes in the number, type and function of circulating immune&#xD;
      cells and measure whether these changes are linked to severity of the infection or death. The&#xD;
      investigators will use established techniques to measure immune function that could be&#xD;
      rapidly put into routine hospital care to help guide treatment for individual patients.&#xD;
