  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assign eighteen participants with anxiety to cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) with computerized cognitive training (CCT). In addition, the study will have a control&#xD;
      group and enroll thirty-six age- and gender-matched anxious children assigned to CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this trial is that CCT with CBT will further increase task control network&#xD;
      (TCN) activation and connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have one CBT therapy session each week for 12 weeks. However, for&#xD;
      participants in the CCT arm plus CBT they will also receive up to 4 weeks of at home CCT to&#xD;
      complete during the two weeks prior to the first CBT session and during the two weeks after&#xD;
      the first CBT session. CCT is to be done at home for approximately 30 minutes per day, 5 days&#xD;
      per week. Additionally, participants in the CCT arm plus CBT will receive CCT for 30 minutes&#xD;
      just prior to CBT sessions 4-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will also have pre and post therapy functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      and be asked to complete anxiety severity interviews and questionnaires throughout the study&#xD;
      as well as after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update as of 4/7/2020: Enrollment and in-person-only interactions/interventions are&#xD;
      temporarily paused due to COVID-19 and are expected to resume in the future. This is not a&#xD;
      suspension of IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update as of 7/20/2020: Enrollment and in-person-only interactions/interventions are resumed.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Brain activation and connectivity in the task-control network (TCN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks (after therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>Pre- to post-CBT changes in brain activation and function connectivity in the task-control network including fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular regions mediating cognitive control. Functional activation and connectivity of these brain regions are assessed using a conflict interference computer task performed during MRI scanning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pediatric Anxiety Rating Score (PARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks (after therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 50 question interview-based tool used to assess for the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents utilizing parental and youth input to guide clinician ratings. The total scores on this scale range from 0 to 30, with scores above 13 indicating clinically meaningful anxiety.</description>

    <intervention_name>computerized cognitive training (CCT)</intervention_name>
    <description>CCT intervention will consist of approximately 30 minutes of CCT games prior to each CBT session, to engage cognitive control capacity prior to receipt of CBT. The CCT games will be designed to target focused attention, response inhibition, working memory and multiple simultaneous attention to constitute a general executive function training, and activate neural systems associated with executive function/cognitive control. Difficulty of the games will be titrated individually and by session to avoid boredom and progressively activate the functional systems underlying cognitive control.</description>
