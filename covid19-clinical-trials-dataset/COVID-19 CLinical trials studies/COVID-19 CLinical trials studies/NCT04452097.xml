  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2a study including 2 parts, phase 1 and phase 2a. The phase 1 part is an&#xD;
      open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and explore the dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of a human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cell product (BX-U001) in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS). Qualified subjects after the screening will be divided into low,&#xD;
      medium, or high dose groups to receive a single intravenous infusion of BX-U001 at the dose&#xD;
      of 0.5×10^6, 1.0×10^6, or 1.5×10^6 cells/kg of body weight, respectively. The Phase 2a part&#xD;
      is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial examining the safety and&#xD;
      biological effects of BX-U001 at the appropriate dose selected from phase 1 for severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia patients with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the phase 1 part.&#xD;
