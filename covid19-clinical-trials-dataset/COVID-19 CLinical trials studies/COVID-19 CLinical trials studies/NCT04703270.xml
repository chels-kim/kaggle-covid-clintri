      This national study will recruit expectant mothers with and without positive nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs for SARS-CoV-2, and aims to determine the seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 amongst&#xD;
      expectant mothers and their infants in the UK, the prevalence of vertical transmission of the&#xD;
      virus or antibodies against the virus, and the effect, if any, on neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
