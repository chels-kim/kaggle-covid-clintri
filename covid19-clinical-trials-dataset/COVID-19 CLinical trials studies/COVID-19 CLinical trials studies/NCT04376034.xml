  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study, involving contacting potential plasma donors and the use of&#xD;
      their plasma to help fight off infections of those suffering from COVID19 in accordance to&#xD;
      collection guidelines for plasma and FDA IND requirement. This study will include up to 240&#xD;
      participants potentially receiving convalescent plasma and up to 1000 potential donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 basic arms to the study: mild, moderate and severe/critical severity. All 3&#xD;
      severity groups are eligible for enrollment, but mild severity will not be given plasma&#xD;
      unless there is progression. Moderate severity will given up to 1 unit of plasma and&#xD;
      severe/critical severity up to 2 units. There is no placebo group, however given the excepted&#xD;
      issues of shortages of plasma, intention to treat will be used for analysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Convalescent plasma (here on referred to as plasma) has been used in emergency&#xD;
      life-threatening situations to treat infections for over 100 years. The plasma is donated by&#xD;
      an individual that has recovered from the very same infection that another person is infected&#xD;
      with. This plasma is enriched in the antibodies that recognize and helped the body's immune&#xD;
      system fight off the infection. When transfused from donor to recipient those antibodies will&#xD;
      aid the recipient in fighting off the infection. In recent history this has been used to&#xD;
      fight Ebola. Recently, the Federal Food and Drug Agency (FDA) made possible expedited&#xD;
      Investigational New Drug (IND) process for plasma use in the fight against COVID19 for&#xD;
      emergency and lifesaving uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several other investigational drugs for treatment of COVID19 such as: Remdesivir,&#xD;
      an antiviral. The off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ritonavir, or Tocilizumab&#xD;
      have been authorized. Convalescent plasma mechanism of action helps to promote health by&#xD;
      working with one's own immune system and will not interfere with the other proposed&#xD;
      medications. It also will not weaken the immune system as the investigational and off label&#xD;
      medications have the potential to do. Convalescent plasma is time honored and although&#xD;
      investigational for each use against novel or rare infections, it is the basis for IgG&#xD;
      infusions in the immunodeficient populations. Currently the use of IgG infusions such as&#xD;
      Intravenous IgG (IVIG) is assumed to not have the right antibodies from donors in the general&#xD;
      public. This is secondary to the novel nature of the COVID19 and the fact that the IVIG&#xD;
      available today was collected 6 to 12 months ago from plasma donors; prior to the COVID19's&#xD;
      outbreak discovery in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is for that reason that IVIG is not recommended at this time and the FDA has made special&#xD;
      fast-tracking announcements for plasma use for COVID19. Currently, plasma is the only&#xD;
      treatment that has a previous history of success in these novel or rare viral outbreak&#xD;
      situations. It has already been reported to have been associated with survival of 5 out of 5&#xD;
      participants in a pilot study in China&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study advanced respiratory support will include any measure of&#xD;
      respiratory support above low flow nasal cannula oxygen (2 Liters/minute flow rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study dyspnea will be defined as any shortness of breath that is not&#xD;
      completely relieved with the use of low flow nasal canula oxygen set to 2 Liters/minute flow&#xD;
      rate and/or requiring breathing treatments such as but not limited to: bronchodilators more&#xD;
      than every 4 hours to relieve symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that more than one recipient is identified and plasma is available in less than&#xD;
      the total number of approved recipients, priority will be given to those approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the IND use of plasma for severe or critical condition. If there still exists a deficit&#xD;
      of plasma, the priority will be given to those on advanced respiratory support with the most&#xD;
      critical settings (if unclear then will be considered a tie); active pressor treatments; age&#xD;
      &lt;1 years of age with days of life, age adjusted for prematurity as a tie breaker; age &gt;60&#xD;
      with years as a tie breaker; and lastly lottery pull with potential remaining recipients as&#xD;
      the final tie breaker.&#xD;
