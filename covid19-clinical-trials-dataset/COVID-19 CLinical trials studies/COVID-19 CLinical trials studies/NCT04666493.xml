  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if a virtual delivery of a group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      program, specifically using &quot;Facing Your Fears&quot; (FYF) curriculum, is helpful in improving&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms for children and youth with ASD. This study will adapt the FYF program for&#xD;
      virtual delivery using a platform called &quot;Zoom for Healthcare&quot; and examine its effectiveness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research team will adapt the Facing Your Fears (FYF) program, in consultation with&#xD;
      program developers, Canadian experts (psychologists) and Holland Bloorview's Research Family&#xD;
      Engagement Committee, to allow for virtual delivery of a traditionally in-person&#xD;
      intervention. Adaptations will build on preliminary work already piloted by program&#xD;
      developers to meet the current needs (e.g., group work with individual support, video&#xD;
      practice for exposures, psychoeducation format).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete one screening phone call and one videoconferencing (Zoom for&#xD;
      Healthcare) call with the research team, where the delegated research staff will introduce&#xD;
      the program and obtain consent for interested and eligible participants. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide consent, then proceed to the second part of the screening to ensure that&#xD;
      potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. It will be made clear to participants&#xD;
      that providing consent and assent at this time will not guarantee study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be enrolled in the study and be asked to&#xD;
      provide the study team with the participant's ASD diagnostic letter via a secure link (using&#xD;
      Sync), complete pre-intervention questionnaires before the start of the program, and&#xD;
      post-intervention questionnaires after completing the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program will be abbreviated from 14 weeks to 12 weeks to maximize the number of families&#xD;
      served during the study period. Each session will be approximately 60-90 minutes (30-45&#xD;
      minutes with parents and children; 30-45 minutes with parents alone). There will be two&#xD;
      check-in calls (approximately 30 mins) with each of the families after weeks 7 and 9 of the&#xD;
      program. The group facilitators will use the Zoom for Healthcare platform to deliver the&#xD;
      intervention virtually.&#xD;
