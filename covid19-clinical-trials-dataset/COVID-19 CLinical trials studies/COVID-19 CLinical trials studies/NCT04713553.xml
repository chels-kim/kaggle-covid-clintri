    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study in healthy individuals. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate the Lot consistency, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
      vaccine candidate (BNT162b2) against COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As one of 5 manufacturing production lots&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At a single dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In adults 18 through 55 years of age&#xD;

             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy participants who are determined by medical history, physical examination (if&#xD;
             required), and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving personal signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous clinical (based on COVID-19 symptoms/signs alone, if a SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result&#xD;
             was not available) or microbiological (based on COVID-19 symptoms/signs and a positive&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result) diagnosis of COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding that would, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, contraindicate intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination with any coronavirus vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals who receive treatment with radiotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy,&#xD;
             including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids, eg, for cancer or an&#xD;
             autoimmune disease, or planned receipt throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulin, from 60 days before study&#xD;
             intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other studies involving study intervention within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             study entry and/or during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in other studies involving study intervention containing lipid&#xD;
             nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator site staff or Pfizer/BioNTech employees directly involved in the conduct&#xD;
             of the study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their&#xD;
