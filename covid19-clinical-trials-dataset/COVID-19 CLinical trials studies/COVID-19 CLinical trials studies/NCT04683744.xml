  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the U.S. remains low (under 65%),&#xD;
      meaning that thousands of people die of colorectal cancer unnecessarily. Colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening tests range from more invasive and very sensitive for polyps and cancer&#xD;
      (colonoscopy) to less invasive and less sensitive (e.g., fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)).&#xD;
      Screening rates go up when patients consider all these tests, not just colonoscopy. Informing&#xD;
      patients about their options for CRC screening could produce higher quality decisions,&#xD;
      improve the match between patient preferences and tests performed, and increase uptake of CRC&#xD;
      screening. Decision aids (DAs) are a promising tool for accomplishing this goal. Also,&#xD;
      precision CRC prevention - providing information about an individual's specific risk for CRC&#xD;
      - has great promise to increase uptake and improve decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing severe challenges to providing CRC screening&#xD;
      and other prevention services. Health systems are trying to adapt, but these efforts have&#xD;
      only begun and are poorly understood. Moreover, patient perceptions of disease risk and risk&#xD;
      from COVID-19 are unknown.&#xD;

      Our study team will engage with the leadership, staff, and providers in our partner&#xD;
      healthcare systems, to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing patient decision&#xD;
      aids and provider notifications as well as cancer risk assessment tools, for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening, and for other evidence-based cancer screening during the COVID pandemic&#xD;
      and, potentially, after the conclusion of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of our study, we will have extensive information regarding how best to&#xD;
      provide decision aids through an EHR portal, with or without personalized information, and to&#xD;
      deliver provider notifications, which can guide broader implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will involve interviews with staff and providers at our partner healthcare systems&#xD;
      to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing decision aids and provider&#xD;
      notifications for colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, we will interview patients to identify perceptions of prevention during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic including risk perception and barriers to screening, perceptions of risk from both&#xD;
      the pandemic and disease, and patient cancer screening and risk prevention behaviors engaged&#xD;
      in or postponed during the pandemic and patient rationales for their decisions. This part of&#xD;
      our study will suggest potentially promising approaches for providing prevention and disease&#xD;
      management during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

    <description>The interview guide will consist of questions to elicit thoughts from health system leadership, providers, and staff about implementing decision aids, provider notifications, and cancer risk assessments in their health center or healthcare system. The questions may be specific to colorectal cancer screening or more generally about other cancer screenings. We may also ask questions about cancer screening initiatives their health center or healthcare system engaged in during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
