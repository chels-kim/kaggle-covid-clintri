  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO), due to the alarming levels of spread, severity and inaction. Dealing with COVID-19&#xD;
      must be done on different fronts, such as mitigation, treatment and prevention. Therefore,&#xD;
      strategies and therapies that can help reduce the COVID-19 rate of contamination are still&#xD;
      important alternatives at this time of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advanced Penetration Technology™ (APT™) is intellectual property owned by Patient Focused&#xD;
      Tele-Health, LLC, a Rockwall, Texas based company. The company's focus is improving&#xD;
      over-the-counter (OTC) topical formulations, allowing consumers better therapeutic outcomes&#xD;
      with non-prescription medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advanced Penetration Technology™ (APT™) is a patent-pending, proprietary transdermal dual&#xD;
      carrier formulation. This formulation provides improved dermal penetration and efficacy of&#xD;
      topical API's. Additionally, the APT™ imparts both a mechanical and biochemical effect on the&#xD;
      microbe/fungal cell walls providing a highly effective method of destruction of microbes.&#xD;
      These unique properties impart the broad spectrum anti-viral capability to the APT™&#xD;
      Tetracycline 3% formulation, breaking barriers in pharmacology and virology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topical formulation APT™ Tetracycline 3% formulation (APT ™ T3X), is a FDA registered,&#xD;
      Non-Prescription product. This formulation is used in an off label manner as an intranasal&#xD;
      application for prevention of COVID-19 and other viruses. The APT™ T3X as a topical&#xD;
      application will penetrate through and into the mucus layer and deeper. This barrier of&#xD;
      coverage will provide a mitigation effect to decrease the viral load of exposure and&#xD;
      infection. The efficacy of APT™ T3X is due to disrupting the lipid envelope in seconds, hence&#xD;
      neutralizing the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous tests were performed with APT™ T3X and the results found were promising. However,&#xD;
      these tests were performed only in vitro and clinical studies demonstrating the ability of&#xD;
      the APT™ T3X to decrease viral exposure and contamination by COVID-19 are necessary to&#xD;
      confirm the possible prophylactic effect, allowing the formulation to be widely distributed&#xD;
      to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of the APT™ T3X compared to&#xD;
      placebo to decrease COVID-19 contamination rate in humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the proposed objective it will be performed a randomized, triple blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. The volunteers will be randomly allocated to two intervention&#xD;
      groups: APT™ T3X or placebo. The volunteers will be blinded to the treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred volunteers will be recruited for the study (50 volunteers per group). As this is&#xD;
      a preliminary study, the number of volunteers was determined by a convenience sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers randomly allocated to the two groups will be instructed to use the APT™ T3X or&#xD;
      placebo, once a day, every day for 21 days (except health professionals that will be&#xD;
      instructed to use APT™ T3X or placebo twice a day, every day for 21 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The investigators will analyze:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. COVID-19 contamination rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other virus or bacteria contamination rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The results obtained will first be tested for normality using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for two independent&#xD;
      proportions will be used in the statistical analysis of the primary outcome of this study,&#xD;
      the COVID-19 contamination rate and for the secondary outcomes: presence of adverse events&#xD;
      and other virus or bacteria contamination rate. For the other secondary outcomes, the number&#xD;
      of adverse events and frequency of adverse events, the Wilcoxon test will be used if this&#xD;
      outcome does not present a normal distribution. If this outcome presents a normal&#xD;
      distribution, the two-tailed, unpaired t test will be used. The level of significance used&#xD;
      will be 5% (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
