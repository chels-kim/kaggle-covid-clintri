      Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi,&#xD;
      and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against Methicillin&#xD;
      Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza H1N1, and rotavirus with good efficacy. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of PVP-I as prophylaxis in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19)-negative&#xD;
      front-line health care workers, hospital patients, and community members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2), has been implicated in over 12 million cases and counting in the United States&#xD;
      alone and has killed at least 1300 health care workers and &gt;250,000 citizens. This, added to&#xD;
      the national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the need to reuse PPE, lends&#xD;
      to the significantly increased risk to healthcare providers. At the beginning of this trial,&#xD;
      there were only 360,000 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx. The virus is&#xD;
      thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation&#xD;
      of droplets, contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials, and airborne&#xD;
      transmission. Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including&#xD;
      intubation, bronchoscopy, proning patients (which can lead to droplet production) and in some&#xD;
      cases are reusing PPE, finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi,&#xD;
      and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well&#xD;
      as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, H1N1, and rotavirus with&#xD;
      good efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure,&#xD;
      it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2. Eggers et&#xD;
      al found that at a concentration of 1% there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99% in&#xD;
      in-vitro assays. At 2 minutes, a concentration of 0.23% was enough to reduce viral loads&#xD;
      appreciably. New data has demonstrated efficacy in-vitro of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 at low&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little&#xD;
      to no effect on mucociliary clearance, olfaction, or thyroid function if iodine holidays are&#xD;
      taken, although care must be utilized in monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation&#xD;
      survey and screened for COVID positivity. They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and&#xD;
      nasal sprays, as well as a calendar card to mark compliance. PVP-I nasal spray and gargle&#xD;
      (10% diluted 1:30) will be used prior to the start of a shift, during &quot;lunch break&quot;, and at&#xD;
      the end of shift. First, the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose (2 sprays each naris).&#xD;
      For adequate coverage, the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the&#xD;
      back of the throat. This should be left in place for 30 seconds. Then, the participant will&#xD;
      gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30&#xD;
      minutes. Treatment will continue for 3 weeks, or until the healthcare worker presents with&#xD;
      COVID symptoms. Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a&#xD;
      second questionnaire assessing study tolerability. At completion of the study, they will be&#xD;
      asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers, a second arm will also be planned for patients&#xD;
      who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure.&#xD;
      These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same&#xD;
      questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent. For patients in the study&#xD;
      group, PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission&#xD;
      and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group. The patients will then be retested&#xD;
      in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community spread has been found to be the most likely implicated in infection and thus the&#xD;
      trial is now being expanded to include community members. Thus, a THIRD arm has now been&#xD;
      added to include community members. Prescreening questionnaires will be given. As long as the&#xD;
      participant has had no prior history of a positive COVID-19 test, they will be considered&#xD;
      eligible for participation. After a screening consultation, they will undergo a COVID-19 test&#xD;
      (should be completed within 72 hours of screening). If negative, they will be eligible.&#xD;
      Participants who are pregnant, breastfeeding, have thyroid disease or cancer, or who have an&#xD;
      allergy to iodine/shellfish/or contrast dye can still participate but will automatically be&#xD;
      on the control arm. Participants may opt to be on either the PVP-I arm or the control arm.&#xD;
      They will be asked to fill out a daily questionnaire regarding their exposures and whether&#xD;
      they were wearing a mask or if other people were wearing a mask at that time.&#xD;
