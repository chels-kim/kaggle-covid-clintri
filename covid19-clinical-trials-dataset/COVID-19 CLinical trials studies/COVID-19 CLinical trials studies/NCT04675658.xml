    <description>Physical activity support is provided by integrating daily structured activities in the classroom delivered by physical activity leaders through a video conferencing platform in partnership with the classroom teacher. Activities last about 10 minutes or less and have the flexibility of being integrated with academic lessons or serving as a break from academics.&#xD;
The activities are simple and get kids moving in place. The activities will be delivered by a research staff member via video conferencing (using the schools preferred platform). A combination of live activities led by the research team and pre-recorded videos will be used (see example below). If live videos do not work for the teacher, they will have the option to only use the pre-recorded videos or receive a list of resources to promote CBPA in their classrooms.</description>

    <description>Same components as the Classroom Intervention Arm plus the following:&#xD;
Family Component: A newsletter will be sent to parents or guardians once every two weeks over the semester and posted on the study website. The newsletters include physical activity information related to safety/protection, skills building, motivation, overcoming barriers, and goal setting and monitoring (all newsletters are included as an appendix). As part of the program, children also receive a Garmin wearable physical activity monitor. Parents or guardians will receive text messages with behavior change messages based on the Garmin data (text message content is included as an appendix). Text messages also contain links to website materials.&#xD;
Texts will be sent out using the Twilio platform.</description>
