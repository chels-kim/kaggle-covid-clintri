  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if using nasal irrigation, also known as nasal&#xD;
      lavage, for 14 days after a positive test can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with&#xD;
      COVID-19. Nasal lavage consists of running salt water in one nostril and out the other to get&#xD;
      rid of germs. Nasal irrigation will be done with either Betadine or baking soda to determine&#xD;
      if adding an antimicrobial or changing the pH of the mucous helps.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if using nasal irrigation, also known as nasal&#xD;
      lavage, can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Nasal lavage consists&#xD;
      of running salt water in one nostril and out the other to get rid of germs. Saline nasal&#xD;
      irrigation with Betadine or baking soda will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to do several things during this study: watch a one minute video&#xD;
      on YouTube, use a nasal irrigation device twice a day for 14 days, complete a one-time&#xD;
      detailed survey and keep a research diary about their usage and symptoms using an on-line&#xD;
      application called Qualtrics, agree to be texted reminders, be called on the phone if they&#xD;
      fail to complete the daily diary two days in a row, agree to be called four times, and&#xD;
      provide contact information for a secondary person who can be contacted if the primary&#xD;
      participant is unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study does not involve any significant risks. However, some people may&#xD;
      find using nasal irrigation causes them some discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are no known benefits to participating in the study participants may see a&#xD;
      reduction in their symptoms more quickly than if they didn't participate in the study.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention - twice-a-day nasal lavage Twice-a-day virucidal group: Participants randomized to betadine will receive 2 gallon jugs of distilled water, two NeilMed Sinus Irrigation bottles and 28 salination packets (with some extras), OR one Navage unit with 28 SaltPods (and some extras), and a cardboard receptacle labeled &quot;used saline containers&quot; to keep track of adherence.&#xD;
Those randomized to receive betadine will also receive one bottle of povidone-iodine, a one-sheet instruction with photographs demonstrating how to add ½ tsp betadine in addition to the salination packet to the sinus irrigation bottle or Navage unit reservoir prior to SaltPod, along with a ½ tsp measuring spoon.</description>
