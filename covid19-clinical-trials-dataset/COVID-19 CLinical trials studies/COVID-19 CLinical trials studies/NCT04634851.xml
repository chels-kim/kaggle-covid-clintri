  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to develop a protocol for home video informed dietary counseling with&#xD;
      the goal of reducing overall sodium consumption among kidney stone formers. To accomplish&#xD;
      this the investigators will: 1)Assess which data available on video visits are most&#xD;
      informative to convey patient sodium consumption, and 2) Administer virtual home visits with&#xD;
      informed dietary counseling in our intervention arm and compare this to standard dietary&#xD;
      counseling looking specifically at the outcome of 24-hour urine sodium excretion results over&#xD;
      time. This study will benefit dramatically from the rapid growth of telehealth medical visits&#xD;
      as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with the ultimate goal to improve and adapt&#xD;
      patient dietary counseling for the prevention of kidney stone disease in the new and evolving&#xD;
      era of telehealth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urolithiasis affects 1 in 11 Americans and is associated with annual health care expenditures&#xD;
      of up to $4.5 billion. Fifty percent of stone risk can be attributed to diet and fluid&#xD;
      intake. Modifications in sodium intake can dramatically reduce risk of kidney stone disease&#xD;
      as determined by 24-hour urine results. Despite this understanding, dietary counseling is&#xD;
      largely ineffective as kidney stone formers have difficulty adhering to low sodium diets. The&#xD;
      precise reasons behind this are unknown, but it is hypothesized that socioeconomic factors&#xD;
      such as low income and low education contribute to a lack of knowledge of, and access to,&#xD;
      healthy alternatives to salty foods. The relationship between lithogenic diet consumption and&#xD;
      stone disease requires a more in depth understanding of patients' home food environments,&#xD;
      dietary habits, and perceived barriers to following a low-sodium diet. This understanding&#xD;
      will help direct appropriate interventions to prevent recurrent stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine historic face-to-face clinic visits rapidly have been replaced with telehealth&#xD;
      encounters with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Such changes will likely remain the standard of care&#xD;
      and will define the new &quot;normal&quot; for some time. This presents an opportunity to integrate&#xD;
      robust information now available through the exponential growth of video visits with directed&#xD;
      dietary counseling. Through video exchange with patients in their homes an abundance of&#xD;
      previously untapped information is immediately available to healthcare providers. Smartphone&#xD;
      video capabilities are available to most stone patients irrespective of their financial&#xD;
      status. Images from telehealth video visits, including patient lifestyle, behaviors,&#xD;
      resources, and home environment will give objective data as to types of food consumed&#xD;
      regularly by patients and their capacity to prepare healthy foods at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following specific aims are proposed: 1) Assess which data from video visits are most&#xD;
      informative for identifying how to counsel patients to reduce patient sodium intake, and 2)&#xD;
      Administer virtual home visit-informed individualized dietary counseling to stone formers and&#xD;
      compare this to survey-informed dietary counseling. 24-hour urinary sodium results and&#xD;
      patient dietary sodium knowledge and perceptions will be monitored over 6 months. This study&#xD;
      will leverage the rapid growth of telehealth medical visits as a consequence of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to better understand and improve food consumption behavior of recurrent&#xD;
      stone formers.&#xD;
