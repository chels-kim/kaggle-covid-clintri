    <textblock>
      Background: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To give initial experience about COVID-19 in Alexandria-Egypt describing&#xD;
      radiological patterns of lung involvement, also surveying prevalence of co-morbid lung&#xD;
      diseases and their effect on COVID-19 presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Retrospective study including 48 patients with positive polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) test for COVID-19 during the period from February 2020 till May 2020 in&#xD;
      Alexandria/Egypt. Full clinical and laboratory data are obtained. High resolution computed&#xD;
      tomography (HRCT) findings are described. Serial follow up studies are done. Surveying&#xD;
      co-morbid lung diseases done including tuberculosis (TB), interstitial lung diseases (ILDs),&#xD;
      chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), immune and vascular-related diseases. Prevalence&#xD;
      rate is the predominant analysis.&#xD;

      1. Study population and medical records review:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This retrospective study in Alexandria/Egypt during the period from February 2020&#xD;
                till May 2020, approved by out Institutional Ethics Committee. Patient consent&#xD;
                waived by the Research Ethics Board, assuring respect of patient and medical&#xD;
                records confidentiality. No overlap with any previously published work.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Forty-eight Egyptian patients with proved COVID-19 test results to be enrolled in&#xD;
                this study without age or sex limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete medical records to be obtained including thorough history taking and&#xD;
                clinical examination. This include patient age and sex, smoking history, exposure&#xD;
                history (including direct contact to positive COVID-19 patient or recent travelling&#xD;
                to high risk countries¬, also health care providers to positive COVID-19 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Present history to be taken regarding patient chest or general complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Past history to be acquired regarding general chronic or debilitating diseases and&#xD;
                cardio-pulmonary co-morbid diseases including TB, ILDs, COPD, immune and vascular&#xD;
                related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thorough general and local chest examination to be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial lab investigations to be obtained including complete blood count (CBC) and&#xD;
                C-reactive protein) CRP. Blood gases and O2 saturation to be also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Strict protocol of infection control to be followed during clinical assessment,&#xD;
                laboratory work and radiological examinations according to the national and the&#xD;
                international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exclusion criteria were: Incomplete medical records, degrade CT images because of&#xD;
                patient tachypnea and motions artifacts, also unremarkable CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical and laboratory data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • The clinical and laboratory data to be obtained and analyzed by four consultant&#xD;
           pulmonogists and single consultant chest pediatrician (having long time experience in&#xD;
           clinical practice of chest infectious diseases and ICU patients for 20 to 33 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CT scanning and parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CT examinations using multiple MDCT machines including Philips Brilliant-16,&#xD;
                Siemens Emotion-64, Toshiba Aquilion-16, Toshiba Aquilion-64 and Toshiba Aquilion&#xD;
                CXL/CX 128.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CT Scanning parameters: Slice thickness: 1 - 1.25 mm. Volumetric HRCT table speed&#xD;
                that yields least cycles of breath holds as possible. Tube rotation: 0.6-0.9&#xD;
                second. Detector Collimation 1 mm. Helical mode (volumetric HRCT). kVp and mA per&#xD;
                slice: 120 - 130 KVp and 200-400 mA, according to type of MSCT machine used, weight&#xD;
                of the patient and clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positive intra-venous contrast administration only when prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CT analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • CT images to be viewed by four consultant radiologists (having long time experience in&#xD;
           thoracic imaging ranging from 11 to 25 years) using either specialized work stations or&#xD;
           Di-com viewers on personal computers with analysis of the axial, sagittal and coronal&#xD;
           planes. MIP and Min-IP reconstructions to be routinely analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of clinico-laboratory data and HRCT findings estimated as the percentage of&#xD;
      patients showing each criteria or abnormality.&#xD;
