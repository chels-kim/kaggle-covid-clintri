  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2019nCoV-101 is a 2-part, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 trial.&#xD;
      Part 1 (Phase 1) of the study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 rS nanoparticle vaccine with or without Matrix-M adjuvant in 131 healthy&#xD;
      participants ≥ 18 to 59 (inclusive) years of age at 2 sites in Australia. An interim analysis&#xD;
      of Part 1 safety and immunogenicity will be performed prior to optional expansion to Part 2.&#xD;
      Part 2 (Phase 2) of the study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a single construct of SARS-CoV-2 rS nanoparticle vaccine with&#xD;
      Matrix-M adjuvant in up to 1,500 healthy participants ≥ 18 to 84 (inclusive) years of age at&#xD;
      up to 40 sites across Australia and/or the United States.&#xD;
