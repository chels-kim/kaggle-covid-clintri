  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current global pandemic at COVID-19 is a major public health issue. Transmission of the&#xD;
      virus is primarily through direct and close person-to-person contact. The protection of&#xD;
      health care personnel and the limitation of transmission of nosocomial COVID is paramount.&#xD;
      Protective measures have already shown their effectiveness in limiting the spread of the&#xD;
      virus: the use of masks, the wearing of protective gowns, the wearing of protective eyewear,&#xD;
      social and physical distancing. A recent U.S. study (Rhee et al. JAMA 2020) reported a very&#xD;
      low incidence of 1.7% of nosocomial COVID, but this was achieved with the application of&#xD;
      rigorous infection risk management protocols. In addition to the widespread use of masks and&#xD;
      protective measures, dedicated COVID units had been created, with air treatment. The&#xD;
      implementation of these dedicated units requires the mobilization of considerable human and&#xD;
      material resources, which is not feasible in all hospitals over the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the second wave of the epidemic in France, with the rising numbers of new cases of&#xD;
      COVDI-19 admitted to intensive care units since the end of the summer 2020, it is essential&#xD;
      to organize the intensive care units to ensure the protection of personnel and limit the risk&#xD;
      of nosocomial COVID-19, while continuing to care for non-COVID patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Intensive Care unit (ICU) at the Nantes University Hospital, a strict protocol for the&#xD;
      management of suspected or confirmed COVID patients has been in place since early september&#xD;
      2020. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this protocol for&#xD;
      managing the infectious risk of SARS-COV-2 on the incidence of nosocomial COVID in patients&#xD;
      admitted in ICU. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      nosocomial-associated COVIDs contracted by caregivers, and the incidence of asymptomatic&#xD;
      positive SARS-CoV-2 cases in ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitted in our ICU since august 2020 were enrolled in the study, after they&#xD;
      have been informed and given their consent for their participation in this observational&#xD;
      study. Data will be collected computerized patient records by the clinicians in charge of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate an inclusion of approximately 600 patients. In an observational&#xD;
      study, there is no risk to the patient&#xD;

    <description>Occurence of a nosocomial COVID-19 that is certain or probable. Community-acquired certain and probable COVIDs will be excluded from the main analysis.&#xD;
The incidence rate of nosocomial COVID will be expressed in patient-days:&#xD;
Ratio of the number of patients with nosocomial COVID to the sum of exposure times, i.e. :&#xD;
for patients without nosocomial COVID: duration of hospitalization in ICU&#xD;
for patients presenting with nosocomial COVID: delay between the date of the start of hospitalization in ICU and the occurrence of nosocomial COVID.</description>

Prevalence of nosocomial and community-acquired COVID in healthcare workers. Prevalence will be defined as the ratio of the number of caregivers developing a COVID to the number of caregivers working in ICU during the inclusion period.&#xD;
Prevalence of patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive samples but asymptomatic in ICU.&#xD;
