  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main clinical manifestation associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is an influenza-like&#xD;
      illness that follows the infection of the respiratory tract. In a few percent of infected&#xD;
      people, inflammation of the lungs leads to severe pneumonia that requires hospitalization, in&#xD;
      intensive care units for the more severe cases. Despite intensive care, a fatal outcome&#xD;
      occurs in 6% and 12% of women and men over 80 years of age hospitalized for severe COVID,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors associated with a higher risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 include age and&#xD;
      low circulating lymphocyte counts. Significant lymphopenia is indeed frequently observed in&#xD;
      patients with severe COVID-19 and both phenotypic and functional changes in antiviral T cells&#xD;
      have been correlated with the severity of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thymus, the organ that produces T lymphocytes, undergoes progressive physiological&#xD;
      involution with age. However, in the elderly, rare cases of thymic hyperplasia are reported&#xD;
      in autoimmune diseases or cancers, or are observed in response to deep lymphopenia, whether&#xD;
      or not associated with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort of patients treated for a SARS-CoV-2 infection could allow to better understand&#xD;
      the role of the thymus in this pathology.&#xD;
