      psychological and physical rehabilitation based humanistic care in the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-2019. As the national medical team sent to Wuhan, investigators proposed a&#xD;
      Psychological and physical rehabilitation based humanistic care regimen generated from our&#xD;
      experience in treating patients with COVID-2019. In addition to routine therapy,&#xD;
      investigators will apply this comprehensive humanistic care regimen to the patients according&#xD;
      to their condition to see the efficacy to this regimen.&#xD;
