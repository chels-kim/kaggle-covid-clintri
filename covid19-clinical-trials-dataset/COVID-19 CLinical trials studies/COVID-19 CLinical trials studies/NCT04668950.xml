  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a drug called fluvoxamine can be used&#xD;
      early in the course of the COVID-19 infection to prevent more serious complications like&#xD;
      shortness of breath. Fluvoxamine is an anti-depressant drug approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19 is considered investigational, which means the US Food and Drug Administration has&#xD;
      not approved it for this use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is fully-remote, which means that there is no face-to-face contact; study&#xD;
      materials including study drug will be shipped to participants' houses. People around the&#xD;
      United States and Canada can participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize approximately 880 participants, age 18 and older, who have&#xD;
      tested tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently experiencing mild symptoms. People&#xD;
      around the United States and Canada can participate. All interactions for this study will be&#xD;
      conducted remotely by videoconferencing, email, or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: All participants will first complete a pre-screen to see if they may be eligible&#xD;
      for the study. Once a participant is confirmed eligible and consented, the study team will&#xD;
      send the study materials. These materials will consist of study medication and&#xD;
      self-monitoring equipment, including an oxygen saturation monitor, blood pressure monitor,&#xD;
      and thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to take either fluvoxamine or a placebo.&#xD;
      This phase of the study will last approximately 15 days and is double-blinded. Participants&#xD;
      will take up to 100mg of fluvoxamine or placebo by mouth twice a day for a daily total of&#xD;
      200mg. Participants will continue this dose for approximately 15 days. Depending on&#xD;
      tolerability, the dose may be adjusted. Participants will also complete short 5 minute&#xD;
      assessments daily to report the results of self-monitoring (including oxygen level, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and temperature), a shortness of breath rating and any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase: The study team will follow participants for approximately 90 days after the&#xD;
      end of the randomized phase. If needed, the study team will review medical records to&#xD;
      determine the clinical course of participants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and woman age 18 and older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Not currently hospitalized&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Proven SARS-CoV-2 positive (per lab or physician report).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently symptomatic with one or more of the following symptoms: fever, cough,&#xD;
             myalgia, mild dyspnea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anosmia (inability to&#xD;
             smell), ageusia (inability to taste), sore throat, nasal congestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Upon initial screening, participant reports one of the following risk factors for&#xD;
             clinical deterioration: age≥40, racial/ethnic group African-American, Hispanic, or&#xD;
             Native American (including more than one race), or 1+ of the following medical&#xD;
             conditions which increase risk for developing moderate-severe COVID illness: obesity,&#xD;
             hypertension, diabetes, heart disease (coronary artery disease, history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, or heart failure), lung disease (eg asthma, COPD), immune disorder (eg&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Illness severe enough to require hospitalization or already meeting study's primary&#xD;
             endpoint for clinical worsening (eg current O2 saturation &lt;92% on room air, current&#xD;
             use of supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation ≥92%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unstable medical comorbidities (eg decompensated cirrhosis), per patient report and/or&#xD;
             medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Immunocompromised (solid organ transplant, BMT, AIDS, on immunological biologics&#xD;
             and/or high dose steroids (&gt;20mg prednisone per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Already enrolled in another COVID 19 medication trial (not including vaccination or&#xD;
             prophylaxis trials)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unable to perform the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Taking donepezil (rationale: donepezil is a S1R agonist), or sertraline (rationale:&#xD;
             sertraline is a strong sigma-1 antagonist).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Taking warfarin-also known as Coumadin (rationale: increased risk of bleeding),&#xD;
             phenytoin (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism), clopidogrel (rationale:&#xD;
             fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism from pro-drug to active drug which raises risk of&#xD;
             cardiovascular events), and St John's wort (rationale: fluvoxamine + St John's wort&#xD;
             are considered contraindicated because of the risk of serotonin syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants, unless these are at a low dose such&#xD;
             that a study investigator concludes that a clinically significant interaction with&#xD;
             fluvoxamine (ie either serotonin syndrome or TCA overdose) is unlikely (examples:&#xD;
             participant takes escitalopram but only at 5-10mg daily; that dose plus 200mg&#xD;
             fluvoxamine would be insufficient to cause serotonin syndrome; or, participant takes&#xD;
             amitriptyline but only at 25mg nightly; even if fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism,&#xD;
             it would be an insufficient dose to cause QTc prolongation or problematic side&#xD;
             effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Individuals who report they have bipolar disorder or are taking medication for bipolar&#xD;
             disorder (lithium, valproate, high-dose antipsychotic), unless the investigator&#xD;
             concludes that the risk for mania is unlikely (ie it is doubtful that the patient&#xD;
             actually has bipolar disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Individuals who take alprazolam or diazepam and are unwilling to cut the medication by&#xD;
             25% (rationale: fluvoxamine modestly inhibits the metabolism of these drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants taking theophylline, tizanidine, clozapine, or olanzapine (drugs with a&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic index that are primarily metabolized by CYP 1A2, which is inhibited&#xD;
             by fluvoxamine) will be reviewed with a study investigator and excluded unless the&#xD;
             investigator concludes that the risk to the participant is low (this would be&#xD;
             unlikely; example: participant takes tizanidine only as needed and is willing to avoid&#xD;
             it for the 15 days of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Received vaccine for COVID-19.&#xD;
