  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in extraordinary public&#xD;
      health orders of social distancing and self-isolation, leading to widespread disruption and&#xD;
      discontinuation of cardiac rehabilitation programmes and other social opportunities for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to exercise. In Austria, the government initiated&#xD;
      drastic public health measures on March 10, 2020, closing all outpatient cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation facilities and restricting inpatient rehabilitation to patients with urgent&#xD;
      medical indications only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19-related national lockdown and public health&#xD;
      restrictions on cardiac rehabilitation patients, with respect to maintenance of physical&#xD;
      activity for secondary CVD prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study poses three research questions, which will be addressed in a mixed-methods study&#xD;
      with sequential quantitative-qualitative (QUANT-QUAL) design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What was the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on patients' physical activity and&#xD;
           physical fitness levels? (QUANT stage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What was the patient experience of the closure of group-based cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
           training due to COVID-19 public health restrictions? (QUAL stage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which insights and learning points may be drawn from patients' experiences during&#xD;
           COVID-19 public health restrictions with respect to the provision of home-based digital&#xD;
           support for physical activity? (QUAL stage)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit a cohort of up to 40 cardiac rehabilitation patients from one&#xD;
      outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centre in Salzburg, Austria, whose rehabilitation programme&#xD;
      was interrupted by COVID-19 public health orders, including &quot;lockdown&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo re-assessment of physical fitness in cycle ergometry test and&#xD;
      re-assessment of cardiovascular risk profile. This will be compared with patients' most&#xD;
      recent available test results from before the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. prior to mid-March&#xD;
      2020) from patient records. Additionally, patients will take part in a semi-structured&#xD;
      qualitative interview in which they will be invited to reflect on their personal experiences&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 lockdown and thereafter.&#xD;
