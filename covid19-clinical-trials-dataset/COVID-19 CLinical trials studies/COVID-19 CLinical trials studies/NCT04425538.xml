    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that early institution of TNFα inhibitor therapy in patients&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 infections will prevent further clinical deterioration and reduce the&#xD;
      need for advanced cardiorespiratory support and early mortality. To address this hypothesis,&#xD;
      a prospective, single center, phase 2 trial is proposed to assess the efficacy of infliximab&#xD;
      or infliximab-abda in hospitalized adult patients with severe or critical COVID-19.&#xD;
      Observations from this study will inform the conduct of prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      studies to follow.&#xD;

      The investigators hypothesize that early institution of TNFα inhibitor therapy in patients&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 infections will prevent further clinical deterioration and reduce the&#xD;
      need for advanced cardiorespiratory support and early mortality. To address this hypothesis,&#xD;
      a prospective, single center, phase 2 trial is proposed to assess the efficacy of infliximab&#xD;
      or infliximab-abda in hospitalized adult patients with severe or critical COVID-19.&#xD;
      Observations from this study will inform the conduct of prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      studies to follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab and Infliximab-abda are TNFα inhibitors currently FDA-approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of autoimmune disorders, including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The risks and&#xD;
      adverse reactions are described in the approved prescribing information for infliximab (or&#xD;
      infliximab-abda). Infliximab will be used when available. Should infliximab be unavailable in&#xD;
      the pharmacy, infliximab-abda, a biosimilar, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with infliximab or infliximab-abda 5mg/kg IV should ideally be administered within&#xD;
      6 hours of enrollment, and no more than 24 hours following enrollment. Pre-medication with&#xD;
      Tylenol 650 mg once 30 minutes prior to infusion would be recommended. Other pre-medications&#xD;
      may be given at the discretion of the treating physician. These include diphenhydramine 50mg&#xD;
      by mouth, as well as prednisone 20mg by mouth, both given 30 minutes prior to infusion. Pulse&#xD;
      and blood pressure should be monitored every 30 minutes during the infusion, and patients&#xD;
      should be monitored for at least 30 minutes following the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment with infliximab is permitted at treating physician discretion 7-21 days following&#xD;
      primary therapy and based on initial response; the usual treatment schedule is every 2 weeks,&#xD;
      this interval is not strictly enforced given the uncertainty of outcomes with primary&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
