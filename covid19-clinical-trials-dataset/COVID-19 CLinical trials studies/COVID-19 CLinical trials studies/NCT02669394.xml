  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial study to&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of a resistance exercise training program for&#xD;
      maintaining white matter integrity and improving cognitive function in older adults with&#xD;
      vascular cognitive impairment, compared with a stretch and relaxation program.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 88 adults with vascular cognitive impairment will be randomized to either a&#xD;
      12-month twice-weekly resistance training program or stretch and relaxation program. There&#xD;
      will be three measurement sessions: baseline, 6 months (midpoint of intervention period), and&#xD;
      12 months (end of intervention period).&#xD;

    <description>The RT program will be a twice-weekly program. A pressurized air system and free weights will be used . The pressurized air system exercises will consist of biceps curls, triceps extension, seated row, latissmus dorsi pull downs, leg press, hamstring curls, and calf raises. Other exercises, with free weights, will include mini-squats, mini-lunges, and lunge walks. The intensity of the training stimulus will initially be at 50% to 60% of 1 repetition maximum (RM) as determined at week two, and progress to 75% to 85% of 1-RM at a work level of 6 to 8 repetitions (2 sets) by week four. The training stimulus will be increased using the 7 RM method.&#xD;
To meet the public health mandates of COVID-19, when it is necessary, training will occur at home, with the use of a set of resistance bands of various weights. Participants will be provided access to instructional videos either by YouTube or DVD. They will be called on a weekly basis to monitor progress and compliance.</description>

             cerebro-spinal fluid) or diffuse symmetrical areas of low attenuation with ill defined&#xD;
             margins extending to the centrum semiovale plus at least one lacunar infarct&#xD;
             (correlating to the white matter grading scale greater than 3 from the Cardiovascular&#xD;
             Health Study) (2,3); and ii. Absence of cortical and/or cortico-sub-cortical&#xD;
             non-lacunar territorial infarcts and watershed infarcts, haemorrhages indicating large&#xD;

             irradiation, etc).&#xD;
