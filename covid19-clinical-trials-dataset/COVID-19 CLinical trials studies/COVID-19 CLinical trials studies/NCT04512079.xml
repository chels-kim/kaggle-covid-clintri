  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented morbidity and mortality in the modern era. To date,&#xD;
      nearly 13 million people have contracted COVID-19, leading to more than 550,000 deaths&#xD;
      worldwide. As the number of affected individuals continues to climb, effective strategies for&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of the disease are of paramount importance. SARS-CoV-2 is understood&#xD;
      to directly invade cells via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which&#xD;
      is expressed predominantly in the lungs but also throughout the cardiovascular system. Thus,&#xD;
      while acute respiratory distress syndrome remains a feared complication, new thromboembolic&#xD;
      disease has emerged as a common and potentially catastrophic manifestation of COVID-19.&#xD;

      This is a Prospective, multi-center, open label, randomized controlled comparative safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness trial with objectives: 1. To determine the effectiveness of enoxaparin and&#xD;
      apixaban in patients hospitalized (but not yet intubated) with confirmed COVID-19 and 2. To&#xD;
      determine the safety of enoxaparin and apixaban in patients hospitalized (but not yet&#xD;
      intubated) with confirmed COVID-19. Observational analyses have suggested potential benefit&#xD;
      for in-hospital use of anticoagulation. Yet, due to a lack of rigorous evidence for optimal&#xD;
      anticoagulation regimens, practice patterns among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 vary&#xD;
      significantly. Specifically, the choice of anticoagulant, dosing, and duration of treatment&#xD;
      are not well understood. A preliminary analysis of approximately 2700 patients admitted to&#xD;
      the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York, demonstrated an association between&#xD;
      in-hospital administration of therapeutic Anticoagulation (AC) and improved survival compared&#xD;
      to no or prophylactic dose AC. A subsequent analysis under review of a larger 4400 patient&#xD;
      cohort with longer follow up demonstrated similar associations with reduction in the risk of&#xD;
      mortality and risk of intubation. Further analyses suggest more pronounced benefit with&#xD;
      therapeutic as opposed to prophylactic doses. Bleeding rates were generally low overall, but&#xD;
      higher among patients on therapeutic anticoagulation. Finally, though exploratory in nature,&#xD;
      a potential signal for benefit was observed for patients on novel oral anticoagulant therapy&#xD;
      (primarily apixaban) at therapeutic doses compared to low molecular weight heparin.&#xD;
      Ultimately, randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate the optimal anticoagulation&#xD;
      regimen to improve outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.&#xD;
