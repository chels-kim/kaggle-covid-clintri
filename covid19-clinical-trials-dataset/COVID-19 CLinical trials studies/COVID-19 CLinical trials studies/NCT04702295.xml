      30 months, multicentre, prospective observational study on adult (&gt;18 years) patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of rare and complex connective tissue diseases (rCTDs) who will be given the&#xD;
      vaccine during the period from January 2021 and January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following diagnosis will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  antiphospholipid syndrome (APS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IgG4-related disease (IgG4),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relapsing polychondritis (RP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sjogren's syndrome (SS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systemic sclerosis (SSc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study aimed at gathering sufficient number of cases of rCTDs&#xD;
      patients who will receive COVID-19 vaccination that will help in better understanding of both&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this population. The study will be promoted both in ERN&#xD;
      ReCONNET Full Members and Affiliated Partners as well as in other centres treating and&#xD;
      managing rare and complex connective tissue diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To promote a harmonised data collection approach on COVID-19 vaccination in rare and&#xD;
           complex CTDs patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccination in rCTDs patients and to&#xD;
           highlight possible disease-specific adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in rCTDs patients and to highlight&#xD;
           potential variables that prevent an effective immunization against COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate differences in term of efficacy and safety among different types of vaccines&#xD;
           in rCTDs patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To depict the ideal patient's profile that would mostly benefit from COVID-19&#xD;
           vaccination&#xD;
