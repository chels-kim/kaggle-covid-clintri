    <textblock>
      This study examines the experience of people who have selected to use the at-home&#xD;
      insemination Mosie Kit to understand the user's experience, the perceived safety and the&#xD;
      efficiency. People who have recently purchased and voluntarily selected to use the Mosie Kit&#xD;
      will be invited to complete a one-time online anonymous survey. The results of the survey&#xD;
      will be analyzed to understand their experiences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At-home intracervical insemination (ICI), folklorickly known as the &quot;turkey-baster&quot; method,&#xD;
      has been used for decades to increase likelihood of pregnancy. This method works by&#xD;
      depositing semen close to or at the cervix. While there are several devices such as over the&#xD;
      counter syringes and silicone caps, the creator of the Mosie Baby syringe believes it is&#xD;
      designed to be more ergonomic and compatible with a woman's body, easy and safe to use, and&#xD;
      results in depositing the semen at or near the cervix opening. The Mosie Kit provides people&#xD;
      with an at-home intracervical insemination option which could be used before resorting to&#xD;
      more invasive and expensive options such as Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) or in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization. There is vast evidence of Mosie's success in the form of happy users who have&#xD;
      conceived. There is a desire to learn more about the safety, useability and experience of&#xD;
      using the Mosie kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study will examine the experience of people who have voluntarily chosen to&#xD;
      purchase and use the Mosie Kit. The Mosie Kit consists of 2 syringes and a semen collection&#xD;
      cup Understanding the safety, useability and experience of using the Mosie Kit will provide&#xD;
      additional information about the nature of using intracervical insemination as a viable&#xD;
      method for getting pregnant. The information gained will increase understanding of how viable&#xD;
      the Mosie Kit is as a first step in trying to conceive and how it is perceived by the people&#xD;
      who have chosen to use it.&#xD;
