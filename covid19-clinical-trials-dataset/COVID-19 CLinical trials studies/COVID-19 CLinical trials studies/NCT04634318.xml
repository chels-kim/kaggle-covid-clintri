  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with COVID-19 have sequelae after the acute phase of infection. These sequelae&#xD;
      can be physical (dyspnea, exercise intolerance, abnormal fatigue) but also psychic (anxiety,&#xD;
      depression). Systemic sequelae have also been observed in pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
      nervous or immune systems. Respiratory rehabilitation (RR) is indicated in these patients to&#xD;
      help their complete recovery without sequelae. These patients' arrival and sanitary&#xD;
      constraints imposed by COVID-19 changed the organization of Health Care Centers (HCC). Risk&#xD;
      of contagiousness after the acute phase of infection still exists. Consequently, patients&#xD;
      must respect a quarantine time on their arrival in HCC and then have no contact with other&#xD;
      HCC patients to respect the barrier rules and social distancing measures. HCC accommodation&#xD;
      capacities are reduced and this is to the detriment of patients with chronic diseases for&#xD;
      whom RR is essential. Certain HCCs saturation can also be responsible for a non-proposal of&#xD;
      RR in the care pathway of patients after COVID-19. To cope with the new constraints imposed&#xD;
      by Covid-19 pandemic, telemedicine is being developed in the affected industrial countries.&#xD;
      Some SRH physicians are starting to offer post-COVID-19 patients the possibility of carrying&#xD;
      out a tele-rehabilitation program (TRR). Such a telemedicine program has been validated for&#xD;
      people with respiratory failure. It allows the patient to follow his care program without&#xD;
      leaving his home and it does not require the visit from a health professional. In addition to&#xD;
      reducing the inflow of post COVID-19 patients in HCC, it allows fragile patients to respect&#xD;
      social distancing. It could also contain virus spread virus on the territory by reducing&#xD;
      patient movements. When choosing between RR and TRR, the clinician must ask himself two&#xD;
      questions. Is TRR as efficient as RR for post-COVID-19 patients? Is there a profile of&#xD;
      patients for whom either method gives better results? This study proposes to evaluate both&#xD;
      methods: a 4-week TRR program vs a conventional RR program in post COVID-19 patients with&#xD;
      sequelae. If the hypothesis that both methods have similar effects is verified, this would&#xD;
      allow the generalization of the prescription of TRR. The benefits will be individual with&#xD;
      greater access to respiratory rehabilitation for post COVID-19 patients. There will also be&#xD;
      collective public health benefits by maintaining sufficient access to HCC for patients with&#xD;
      chronic diseases.&#xD;

      Some COVID-19 patients have sequelae after infection acute phase. These sequelae can be&#xD;
      physical (dyspnea, exercise intolerance, abnormal fatigue) but also psychic (anxiety,&#xD;
      depression). Systemic sequelae have also been observed in pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
      nervous or immune systems. Respiratory rehabilitation (RR) is indicated in these patients to&#xD;
      help their complete recovery. Regional Health Agencies (ARS) have listed Health Care Centers&#xD;
      (HCCs) that can welcome these patients. Their arrival and sanitary constraints imposed by&#xD;
      COVID-19 changed these HCC organization. Risk of contagiousness after infection acute phase&#xD;
      still exists. Consequently, patients must first respect a quarantine time and then have no&#xD;
      contact with other HCC patients to respect barrier rules. HCC accommodation capacities are&#xD;
      reduced to the detriment of patients with chronic diseases for whom RR is essential. Certain&#xD;
      SSRs saturation can also be responsible for a non-proposal of RR to COVID-19 patients. To&#xD;
      cope with the new constraints imposed by COVID-19, telemedicine is beeing developed in&#xD;
      affected industrial countries. Some SRH physicians are starting to offer post-COVID-19&#xD;
      patients a tele-rehabilitation program (TRR). Such a program has been validated for people&#xD;
      with respiratory failure. It allows a patient to follow his care program without leaving home&#xD;
      and it does not require health professional visits. In addition to reducing post COVID-19&#xD;
      patient inflow in HCC, it allows fragile patients to respect social distancing and could&#xD;
      contain virus spread on the territory by reducing patient movements. When choosing between RR&#xD;
      and TRR, a clinician must ask himself two questions. Is TRR as efficient as RR for&#xD;
      post-COVID-19 patients? Is there a profile of patients for whom either method gives better&#xD;
      results? This study evaluates both methods: a 4-week TRR program vs a conventional RR&#xD;
      program. If the hypothesis that both methods have similar effects is verified, this would&#xD;
      allow TRR prescription generalization. Benefits will be individual with greater access to&#xD;
      respiratory rehabilitation for post COVID-19 patients. There will also be collective benefits&#xD;
      by maintaining sufficient SSR access for patients with chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study could also help clinicians to choose the best therapeutic methods to combat post&#xD;
      COVID-19 sequelae. Indeed, effectiveness study of rehabilitation programs according to&#xD;
      medical, physical and psychological patient profile will define what is the most suitable&#xD;
      post COVID-19 care method (TRR or RR) for each patient. Thus, it could help to determine the&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients for whom a tele-rehabilitation program is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions carried out in RR and TRR programs are similar. Session number is the same in both&#xD;
      programs. They have the same goal and the same intensity. In RR program, sessions are carried&#xD;
      out at Ren√©e Sabran Hospital, supervised by medical staff. In TRR program, sessions are&#xD;
      carried out at patient's home, supervised by medical staff by videoconference. Additionally,&#xD;
      aerobic and walking sessions are carried out outside home. The intensity of each session will&#xD;
      be controlled by heart rate monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same outcome measurements are carried out before and after both respiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs. To verify that both respiratory rehabilitation programs have similar&#xD;
      efficiency, outcome measures will be analyzed using a 2-factor analysis of variance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group (TRR vs RR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time (before vs after respiratory rehabilitation program)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between effectiveness of both respiratory rehabilitation programs and the&#xD;
      different characteristics of patients when programs start will be analyzed using multiple&#xD;
      linear regression.&#xD;

    <description>The 6-min walk test (6 MWT) measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). (ATS Statement: Guidelines for the Six-Minute Walk Test, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2002)</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All 1-min STS tests are performed according to a standardized protocol by trained study staff. A standard chair is used (height 46-48 cm) with a flat seat and no armrests, stabilized against a wall. Patients are asked to sit with their legs hip-width apart and flexed to 90¬∞, with their hands stationary on the hips without using the hands or arms to assist movement. They are instructed to stand completely straight and touch the chair with their bottom when sitting, but they need not sit fully back on the chair. Patients are asked to perform as many repetitions as possible in 1 min, and after 45 s are told &quot;you have 15 s left until the test is over&quot;. (Crook S, et al.

    <description>Patients in the TRR group will realize the 4-week respiratory tele-rehabilitation program at home. The TRR program for each week includes the same sessions as RR program. But, medical consultation, sophrology, occupational therapy, psychomotricity and muscle strengthening sessions are carried out through live videoconferences. Additionally, aerobic and walking sessions are carried out outside home. The intensity of each session will be controlled by heart rate monitor.</description>
