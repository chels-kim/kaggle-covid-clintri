             physical examination at screening/baseline, including participants who are healthy or&#xD;
             have a chronic, stable medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;

             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of prior positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test or positive SARS-CoV-2 serology test&#xD;

          2. Participant has lived with individuals who have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or&#xD;
             currently lives with individuals who have SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the exception of&#xD;
             the index case(s), the first individual(s) known to be infected in the household&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active respiratory or non-respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of respiratory illness with sign/symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, within the prior 6 months to screening&#xD;
