    <textblock>
      Prompted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has&#xD;
      recommended the use of telemedicine to continue ophthalmic care while maintaining patient and&#xD;
      provider social distancing. As part of remote examinations, patients may be expected to&#xD;
      perform home eye testing for visual acuity and the use of various home visual acuity charts&#xD;
      have been proposed to provide clinicians with this vital data. However, the use of home&#xD;
      visual acuity exams has not been validated in our patient population. This project aims to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and validity of measuring visual acuity at home with a printed-out&#xD;
      ETDRS chart.&#xD;

      Project Title Validity of Home Visual Acuity Measurements with an ETDRS Chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Summary Prompted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, the American Academy of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology has recommended the use of telemedicine to continue ophthalmic care while&#xD;
      maintaining patient and provider social distancing. As part of remote examinations, patients&#xD;
      may be expected to perform home eye testing for visual acuity and the use of various home&#xD;
      visual acuity charts have been proposed to provide clinicians with this vital data. However,&#xD;
      the use of home visual acuity exams has not been validated in our patient population. This&#xD;
      project aims to determine the efficacy and validity of measuring visual acuity at home with a&#xD;
      printed-out ETDRS chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Description Rationale: Many ophthalmology visits are being conducted remotely via&#xD;
      telehealth. The use of home ETDRS charts is being proposed for patients to report their&#xD;
      visual acuity. However, the efficacy and validity of this method in our population should be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determine the efficacy and validity of measuring visual acuity at home with a&#xD;
      printed-out ETDRS chart in the population served by Vanderbilt Eye Institute. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that measuring visual acuity at home with a printed-out ETDRS is non-inferior to visual&#xD;
      acuity measurements by a trained technician in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study population will include patients scheduled for in-person visits for&#xD;
      various subspecialties (Glaucoma, Retina/Uveitis, Pediatrics and Cornea) at Vanderbilt Eye&#xD;
      Institute's (VEI) Nashville campus during the period of 4/27/20-5/27/20. Patients will be&#xD;
      excluded if they have a last best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/200, have not&#xD;
      activated a My Health at Vanderbilt (MHAV) account, or do not speak English. Patients will&#xD;
      also need to be between the ages of 18-90 to Approximately one week prior to their&#xD;
      appointments, patients will be called to obtain e-consent and provide detailed instructions&#xD;
      for measuring best corrected visual acuity at home with the ETDRS chart that is calibrated&#xD;
      for 5 feet. Instructions will also be sent via MHAV along with the ETDRS chart and the&#xD;
      consent form. Data collected will include age, sex, and primary ophthalmological diagnosis as&#xD;
      well as last measured Snellen visual acuity (+/-3months). The department, provider, and date&#xD;
      of the in-person appointment will also be collected. Patients will be instructed to complete&#xD;
      a home visual acuity check two-four days prior to appointment and send a message through MHAV&#xD;
      with the results. Participants will record the smallest full line ( 5 letters) in each eye&#xD;
      that they can read. If a message is not received two days prior to the appointment, a&#xD;
      research assistant will call the patient back to reconfirm the plan. At the in-person visit,&#xD;
      patients will begin their encounter with an ETDRS assessment at VEI, using the ETDRS chart at&#xD;
      20 feet. Again, the full line of 5 letters read will be used for analysis. Patients will&#xD;
      receive a survey to be completed in clinic with a 5-point Likert scale to rate the ease of&#xD;
      home visual acuity as well as a short response question about barriers to assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis: Data will be collected from the electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      and kept in a password-protected deidentified Excel document. Visual acuities will be&#xD;
      converted to logMAR for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations: There are no ethical considerations to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to Home Visual acuity testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poor/no access to the technical requirements - computer, printer, internet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not feel confident of being able to test vision accurately at home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attempted to test vision at home but was unable to follow instructions completely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not want to try it at home, medical procedures should be done in a clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vision too poor to perform these tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Home visual acuity test was easy to set up and perform&#xD;
