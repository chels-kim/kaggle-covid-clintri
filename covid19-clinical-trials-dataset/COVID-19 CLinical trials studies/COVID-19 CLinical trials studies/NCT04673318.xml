      Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for developing&#xD;
      serious complications related to SARS-CoV-2 resulting in prolonged sequelae. The goal of this&#xD;
      proposal is to compare the benefits of home-based lower limb heat therapy to exercise&#xD;
      training on cardio-metabolic function and mobility in older adults during their convalescence&#xD;
      from hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2), first identified in&#xD;
      December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has since spread worldwide. Older adults and people with&#xD;
      underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for developing serious complications and&#xD;
      death related to SARS-CoV-2. However, another challenge is arising in regards to the&#xD;
      long-term prognosis of COVID-19 survivors. Although limited, the available data on the&#xD;
      medium-term outcomes of patients who survived COVID-19 all indicate prolonged symptom&#xD;
      duration and disability in a large proportion of adults hospitalized with severe symptoms. In&#xD;
      addition, these patients, a majority of whom were older adults or patients with pre-existing&#xD;
      health conditions, spent ~10-15 days bedridden and under intensive treatment, which can have&#xD;
      lasting consequences on metabolism and cardiovascular functions, mobility, and eventually&#xD;
      lead to long-term disabilities. Upon discharge from the hospital, the main option for&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation involves exercise training. Although, exercise training can be&#xD;
      effective to restore physical function, it is oftentimes associated with low adherence.&#xD;
      Considering the severe deconditioning accompanying hospitalization related to COVID-19, there&#xD;
      is a critical need for the development of a rehabilitation strategy that is home-based and&#xD;
      practical to individuals with diminished physical function. Accordingly, the goal of this&#xD;
      project is to compare the benefits of home-based lower limb chronic heat therapy to exercise&#xD;
      training on skeletal muscle metabolism, vascular function and functional capacity in older&#xD;
      adults during their convalescence from hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2. Late middle-age and&#xD;
      older adults that have been discharged from a COVID-19 hospitalization will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to an exercise intervention group (EX, low resistance ~40 min, 3 times a week at&#xD;
      home), a heat-treated group (HT, leg heated garments with skin temperature reaching ~40ËšC,&#xD;
      40-55 min, 5 times a week at home), or a control group (CT) for 8 weeks. Specific Aim 1 will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that local heat therapy in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients can&#xD;
      (i) enhance functional capacity, resulting in improvements in mobility and quality of life&#xD;
      compared to a non-treated control group, and (ii) that these changes will be similar in&#xD;
      magnitude to an exercise intervention. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that local&#xD;
      heat therapy in the same patients can (i) enhance insulin sensitivity as a consequence of&#xD;
      improvements in mitochondrial and vascular function compared to a non-treated control group,&#xD;
      and (ii) that these changes will be similar in magnitude to an exercise intervention.&#xD;
