  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study aims at prospectively collecting detailed clinical information on patients&#xD;
      positive to or suspected of COVID-19 visiting Italian emergency departments (EDs). The&#xD;
      objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To monitor and describe the COVID-19 patients visiting Italian EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the prognostic impact of demographics, clinical characteristics, risk factors&#xD;
           and pre-existing diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop a predictive model, providing estimates of the prognosis using multiple&#xD;
           relevant factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To construct a detailed database to enable comparative effectiveness research (CER),&#xD;
           with the goal of generating hypothesis of efficacy and effectiveness of treatments,&#xD;
           therapies and interventions, in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All the ED patients positive to or suspected of COVID-19 infection will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Descriptive reports of the collected data will be produced regularly. Different levels&#xD;
      of aggregation will be considered: single center, province, region. In addition to providing&#xD;
      useful elements to describe the evolution of the epidemic, the results presented in these&#xD;
      reports will provide an accurate clinical description of a large sample of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be leveraged to identify the most important risk factors and clinical&#xD;
      conditions to predict poor patient outcomes. The most relevant factors will be selected using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors will be used as predictors in multivariable predictive models, which will be&#xD;
      developed to estimate the expected prognosis of the patients. The study outcomes will be&#xD;
      death or need of intubation within 7 days since ED arrival and 30-day mortality. Given the&#xD;
      dichotomous nature of these variables, the models will be developed with logistic regression.&#xD;
      The models will be first developed when the study will enroll the minimum number of necessary&#xD;
      patients, and periodically updated. In this way, predictive tools capable of making accurate&#xD;
      estimates of the prognosis of patients will be returned to the clinical practice as soon as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will record the use of treatments and drugs, such as antivirals, ACE inhibitors and&#xD;
      sartans, whose effect on COVID-19 patients is not yet clear and mostly based on small&#xD;
      studies. The large cohort of patients will be used to perform CER analyses and evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of these treatments on the prognosis of patients, with appropriate statistical&#xD;
      methodology to account for the observational nature of the data. These results will be used&#xD;
      to refine and improve the experimental design of this project.&#xD;
