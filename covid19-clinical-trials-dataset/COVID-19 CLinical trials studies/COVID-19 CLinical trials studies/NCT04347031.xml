      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of the effectiveness and safety of the drug Mefloquine, tablets 250 mg, produced by&#xD;
      FSUE &quot;SPC&quot; farmzaschita &quot; FMBA of Russia (Russia), in comparison with the drug&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine, tablets 200 mg, for the treatment of patients with coronavirus infection,&#xD;
      in the &quot;off-label&quot; mode, to make a decision on the possibility of expanding the indications&#xD;
      for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the efficacy of the drug Mefloquine, tablet 250 mg, for the treatment of&#xD;
           patients with coronavirus infection (light and medium-heavy form), the appointment in&#xD;
           the &quot;off-label&quot; in comparison with the drug Hydroxychloroquine tablets 200 mg, when&#xD;
           administered in the mode &quot;off label&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the effectiveness of the drug Mefloquine, tablet 250 mg, when administered in&#xD;
           the mode &quot;off label&quot;, in comparison with the drug Hydroxychloroquine tablets 200 mg,&#xD;
           when administered in the mode &quot;off label&quot; when applied to a schema for the treatment of&#xD;
           patients with severe coronavirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Mefloquine, 250 mg tablets, and&#xD;
           Hydroxychloroquine, 200 mg tablets, for the treatment of patients with coronavirus&#xD;
           infection (mild and moderate-severe forms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Mefloquine, 250 mg tablets, and&#xD;
           Hydroxychloroquine, 200 mg tablets, for the treatment of patients with coronavirus&#xD;
           infection (severe forms), when used as part of a regimen for the treatment of patients&#xD;
           with severe coronavirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open, randomized, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of Mefloquine&#xD;
      and Hydroxychloroquine in &quot;off-label&quot; mode for the treatment of patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      coronavirus infection&#xD;
