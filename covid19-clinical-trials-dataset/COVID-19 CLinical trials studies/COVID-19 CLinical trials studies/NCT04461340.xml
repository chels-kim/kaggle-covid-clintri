  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In early December 2019, several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in Wuhan&#xD;
      (China). A novel enveloped RNA β coronavirus was isolated and named severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2). The new virus rapidly spread across China and worldwide.&#xD;
      On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) a pandemic. As of 1July 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in 10,357,662&#xD;
      individuals globally with deaths reaching 508,055 with a morality of 5.37%. Egypt has 68,311&#xD;
      confirmed cases and 2935 deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets from infected patients. The clinical&#xD;
      spectrum of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic forms to severe pneumonia requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization and isolation in critical care units with the need of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Main symptoms include fever, fatigue and&#xD;
      dry cough. Common laboratory findings include lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase&#xD;
      levels. Platelet count is usually normal or mildly decreased. C reactive protein (CRP) and&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are usually increased while procalcitonin levels are&#xD;
      normal and elevation of procalcitonin usually indicates secondary bacterial infection.&#xD;
      Ferritin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase elevation is associated with severe disease. Chest&#xD;
      computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass&#xD;
      opacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe COVID-19 conditions are usually due to an aggressive inflammatory response known as&#xD;
      &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that is characterized by the release of a large amount of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. Lung injury, multiorgan failure, and unfavorable prognosis of severe COVID-19&#xD;
      infection have been attributed mainly to the cytokine storm state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many proinflammatory cytokines elevate in COVID-19 patients including interleukin (IL)-1,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon( IFN)-Ȣ stimulating immune&#xD;
      cells to invade sites of infection causing endothelial dysfunction, vascular damage, alveolar&#xD;
      damage and ARDS. Cytokine storm has been reported in several viral infections including&#xD;
      influenza H5N1 virus, influenza H1N1 virus, and the two coronaviruses highly related to&#xD;
      COVID-19; &quot;SARS-CoV&quot; and &quot;MERSCoV&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no vaccine and/or specific therapeutic drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
      Hence, it remains a major challenge to decide what potential therapeutic regimens to prevent&#xD;
      and treat severe COVID-19 infections. Effective vaccines are essential to combat against the&#xD;
      extremely contagious SARS-CoV-2. Until we have specific vaccines or therapeutic drugs&#xD;
      targeting SARS-CoV-2, &quot;repurposed&quot; drugs have been used to treat COVID-19 patients. At&#xD;
      present, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are mainly repurposing the available therapeutic&#xD;
      drugs and based on symptomatic conditions. Considering ARDS, followed by secondary&#xD;
      infections, antibiotics, antiviral therapy, systemic corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (including anti-arthritis drugs) are often used in the treatment regimens.&#xD;
      Neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors, convalescent plasma, and traditional&#xD;
      herbal medicines have also been utilized in the treatment of COVID 19. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      efficacy of these treatment regimens remains to be verified by appropriately designed&#xD;
      clinical trials. Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is an immunosuppressant that is used to&#xD;
      prevent organ transplant rejection by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase.&#xD;
      mTOR plays a key role in viral replication. In an in vitro experiment, sirolimus has been&#xD;
      shown to affect PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway which inhibited MERS-CoV activity. Studies of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with influenza can further shed light on the antiviral effect of sirolimus. In a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial conducted on 38 patients with confirmed H1N1 pneumonia and on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator support, a group treated with corticosteroids and 2 mg/day of sirolimus&#xD;
      for 14 days (N=19) showed significantly better clinical outcomes compared with the group&#xD;
      treated with corticosteroids only, including shorter median duration of ventilator used.&#xD;
      Delayed oseltamivir plus sirolimus treatment in pH1N1-infected mouse model further suggested&#xD;
      a significant association between the sirolimus treatment and improved outcomes. At least one&#xD;
      in silico study identified sirolimus as one of the 16 potential candidates for treating&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients based on data from other human coronavirus infections using network-based&#xD;
      drug repurposing model.&#xD;
