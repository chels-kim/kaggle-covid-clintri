      This study is a randomized, double-blinded clinical Trial, to evaluate the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      the commercial scale Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine against that of the pilot scale among&#xD;
      adults aged 26-45 years, and the open-labelled, bridging non-inferiority of the vaccine&#xD;
      induced immunogenicity in elderly against that in adults. The experimental vaccine was&#xD;
      manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co.,Ltd. Totally 1040 subjects，including: 130&#xD;
      subjects aged 18~25 years; 520 subjects aged 26~45 years, with 260 in each group; 130&#xD;
      subjects aged 46~59 years; 260 subjects aged ≥60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to receive two doses of medium-dosage vaccine on the schedule of&#xD;
      0,14.&#xD;
