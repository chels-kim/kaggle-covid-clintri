  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study with the primary objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of FT516 using 3 dose-escalation strategies (number of doses and cell dose) for the&#xD;
      treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study provides initial estimates of&#xD;
      safety and efficacy based on stable respiratory function, as well as, determining the&#xD;
      feasibility for full-scale studies designed both for efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the urgency of COVID-19 and the known anti-viral activity of natural killer (NK) cells,&#xD;
      this clinical trial uses immediately available off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cell&#xD;
      (iPSC) derived NK cells already being used to treat cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FT516 is an off-the-shelf cryopreserved NK cell product derived from an iPSC that was&#xD;
      transduced with a high affinity, ADAM17 non-cleavable CD16 (Fc receptor) that maintains CD16&#xD;
      on the cell surface, which remains fully functional after NK cell activation. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that natural developing anti-COVID IgG (early data suggest that some&#xD;
      develop in 7-10 days after diagnosis) will enhance targeting of FT516 to infected cells.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study starts with a fast-track design by proceeding in cohorts of one patient until the first DLT is observed. If no DLT is observed, escalation continues by one patient per cohort until Dose Strategy 3 is reached. If the MTD is not yet established by Dose Strategy 3, Dose Strategy 3 is expanded to 6 patients using the final stage of a &quot;3+3&quot; design. An extension of 4 additional patients is planned if FT516 continues to be safe for a total of 10 patients treated at the MTD.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An accelerated (fast-track) design will continue until first DLT is observed or the maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
DLT is defined as any treatment emergent toxicity within 7 days after the last dose of FT516 meeting one of the following criteria based on CTCAE v5:&#xD;
Grade 3 or greater infusion related reaction following FT516 infusion&#xD;
Any new or worsening Grade 3 and any Grade 4 adverse events with the exception of the following known complications of COVID-19:&#xD;
Grade 3 gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea)&#xD;
Grade 3 hepatic investigations (ALT increased, AST increased)&#xD;
Grade 3 leukopenia/lymphopenia&#xD;
Respiratory deterioration between the 1st dose and 7 days after the last dose of FT516 defined as the need for any type of assisted ventilation (invasive or non-invasive including BiPAP) or oxygen delivery device intended to deliver ≥60% FiO2 (including non-rebreather mask or &gt;10L by simple facemask) to maintain an SpO2 &gt;88%.</description>
