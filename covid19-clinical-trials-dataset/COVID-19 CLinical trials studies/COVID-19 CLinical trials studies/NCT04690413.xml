      This study is designed to compare the performance of the NOWDx COVID-19 Test to an emergency&#xD;
      use authorized PCR test result. The intent is to show the rapid test device is comparable to&#xD;
      a currently marketed device. The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is an in vitro lateral flow immunoassay&#xD;
      intended for qualitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human whole blood&#xD;
      (venous and fingerstick).&#xD;

      This study is designed to compare the performance of the NOWDx COVID-19 Test to an emergency&#xD;
      use authorized PCR test result. The intent is to show the rapid test device is comparable to&#xD;
      a currently marketed device. The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is an in vitro lateral flow immunoassay&#xD;
      intended for qualitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human whole blood&#xD;
      (venous and fingerstick).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an&#xD;
      adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. At this time,&#xD;
      it is unknown for how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of&#xD;
      antibodies confers protective immunity. Testing of human venous whole blood (EDTA) and&#xD;
      fingerstick specimens are intended to be conducted in patient care settings authorized to&#xD;
      perform CLIA waived tests.&#xD;
