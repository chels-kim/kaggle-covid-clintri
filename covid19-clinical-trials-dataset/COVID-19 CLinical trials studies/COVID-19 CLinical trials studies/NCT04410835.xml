      The aim of this study is to measure current affective symptoms and psychological distress in&#xD;
      individuals with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online&#xD;
      questionnaire survey. In addition, this study aims at identifying individual beliefs, sleep&#xD;
      quality, attitudes concerning the virus, the adherence to the measures, believing processes,&#xD;
      and coping strategies/resilience patterns referring to COVID-19 in different study centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of&#xD;
      respiratory illness (corona virus disease COVID-19) all over the world. The COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological&#xD;
      resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies reviewed the psychological impact of quarantine and reported negative psychological&#xD;
      effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger, infection fears,&#xD;
      frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and&#xD;
      stigma. A loss of daily structure and reduced social contacts were associated with&#xD;
      frustration, boredom, reduced psychological-well being and psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently conducted online questionnaire survey, investigating emotional responses and&#xD;
      coping strategies of nurses, found sex differences in anxiety and fear referred to COVID-19&#xD;
      (women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men) and differences between participants&#xD;
      from cities showing more anxiety and fear compared with participants from rural showing more&#xD;
      sadness. The closer COVID-19 was to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these investigated psychological variables (i.e. anxiety, depression, boredom, loss of&#xD;
      daily structure) have been found to impact the course and outcome of psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
      Nowadays, COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for&#xD;
      the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of&#xD;
      psychological crisis and patients with psychiatric disorders may experience more or less&#xD;
      psychological symptoms than healthy control persons. According to a recent study, lithium,&#xD;
      widely used to treat bipolar disorder, has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity and&#xD;
      appears as a possible candidate for therapy of COVID-19. However, more research data are&#xD;
      needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do psychiatric patients experience the COVID-19 outbreak including quarantine and&#xD;
           are there associations with affective symptoms and psychological distress? Is there a&#xD;
           change in symptomatology during time? Are there differences to healthy controls, and&#xD;
           between individuals with different diagnosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a difference between psychiatric patients and healthy controls in regard to&#xD;
           emotional response, cognition and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine?&#xD;
           Is there a difference between different psychiatric diagnosis groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there an association between consequences of social distance on lifestyle factors&#xD;
           (nutrition, sleep quality, physical activity, substance abuse) and are there&#xD;
           associations with psychological well-being/psychological symptoms in individuals with&#xD;
           psychiatric disorder and controls? Is there a difference between different psychiatric&#xD;
           diagnosis groups and healthy controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What do individuals with psychiatric disorders think about the COVID-19 related measures&#xD;
           und quarantine regulations and how is the adherence to the measures? Are there&#xD;
           associations between adherence and attitude towards COVID-19 measures? Is there a&#xD;
           difference between patients and healthy controls? Is there a difference between&#xD;
           different psychiatric diagnosis groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are there sex and age differences in the investigated variables? (emotional response to&#xD;
           COVID-19 outbreak, attitude towards measures, adherence)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is there a relationship between an infection with SARS-CoV-2 and disease course in&#xD;
           psychiatric disorder? Is there a difference between different psychiatric diagnosis&#xD;
           groups and healthy controls? Which role plays lithium treatment (prescribed beyond the&#xD;
           study) in this context? The investigators hypothesize, loss of daily structure, reduced&#xD;
           social contacts, loneliness, reduced psychiatric care, and other possible lifestyle&#xD;
           changes due to the quarantine and social distancing measures, have a negative effect on&#xD;
           psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, somatisation, sleep quality) in individuals&#xD;
           with psychiatric disorder compared to healthy controls. In contrast, resilience and&#xD;
           positive cognition processes might be positively correlated to psychological well-being.&#xD;

        Based on previous experience of the researchers working within the sector, we anticipated&#xD;
        that it would be possible to recruit a conservative average of 100 psychiatric patients per&#xD;
        outpatient clinic Thus, we aim to recruit at least 500 patients and 500 healthy controls in&#xD;
        total which would be a large enough sample to conduct most subgroup analyses. Nevertheless,&#xD;
        in case we can recruit a larger number of participants allowing further subgroup analysis&#xD;
        it would be useful. The assumed response rate is 70 %.&#xD;
