      Background: The virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout the world. Seniors are at high&#xD;
      risk of severe COVID-19 when infected. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a vaccine against&#xD;
      tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other infections; significant&#xD;
      reductions in morbidity and mortality have been reported, and a plausible immunological&#xD;
      mechanism has been identified: &quot;trained innate immunity&quot;. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      BCG vaccination can reduce the risk of COVID-19 and other infections among senior citizens&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary objective: To reduce senior citizens' risk of acute infection during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives: To reduce senior citizens' risk of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce senior citizens' risk of self-reported&#xD;
      respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A placebo-controlled randomized trial. Study population: 1900 seniors 65 years&#xD;
      of age or above. Intervention: Participants will be randomized 1:1 to intradermal&#xD;
      administration of a standard dose of BCG vaccine or placebo (saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Primary outcome: &quot;Acute infection&quot; identified either by a doctor, antibiotics use,&#xD;
      hospitalization, or death due to infection. Secondary outcomes: Verified SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      and self-reported respiratory illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an expected incidence of &quot;acute infection&quot; of 20%, the trial can show a 25% risk&#xD;
      reduction in the the intervention group versus the placebo group by including a total of 1900&#xD;
      individuals, 950 individuals in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk for participants and impact: Based on previous experience and randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials in adult and elderly individuals, the risks of BCG vaccination are considered low. If&#xD;
      BCG can reduce the risk of acute infection in seniors by 25% it has tremendous public health&#xD;
      importance, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and overall.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION One of the most recognized consequences of aging is a decline in immune&#xD;
      function, so-called &quot;immunosenescence&quot;. Vaccination is the most effective prophylactic&#xD;
      intervention for infectious diseases, but due to immunosenescence, the efficacy of vaccines&#xD;
      decreases with increasing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to immunosenescence, severe infections are more common in the elderly. Not least during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that elderly people are particularly susceptible&#xD;
      to severe COVID-19. Strategies to strengthen senior citizens' immune system are urgently&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed as a childhood vaccine against tuberculosis, but&#xD;
      our group has shown that it can protect against death from other infections, i.e. it has what&#xD;
      the investigators have called non-specific effects (NSEs). In clinical studies, BCG&#xD;
      vaccination was associated with decreased child mortality, mainly as a result of reduced&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis and respiratory infections. In a meta-analysis commissioned by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO), BCG was associated with a 42% (95%CI: 24-55%) reduction in child&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSEs of BCG are not limited to children. An Indonesian trial with 34 subjects aged 60-75&#xD;
      years reported that compared with placebo, consecutive BCG vaccination for 3 months reduced&#xD;
      the incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infections by 80% (95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI)=22-95%). In a very recent clinical trial in Greece, BCG vs. placebo to senior citizens&#xD;
      at discharge from the hospital was associated with a significant decrease in time to first&#xD;
      infection (p: 0.035). The incidence of new infections was 42.3% (99% CIs 31.9 53.4%) in the&#xD;
      placebo group and 25.0% (95% CIs (16.4-36.16%) in the BCG group; most of the protection was&#xD;
      against respiratory tract infections (odds ratio 0.20; p: 0.001). No difference in the&#xD;
      frequency of adverse effects was found between groups. These data show that BCG vaccination&#xD;
      is safe and can protect the elderly against infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological studies have now provided an explanation for the observed NSEs of BCG: BCG&#xD;
      induces epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells such as myeloid cells&#xD;
      and Natural Killer cells, leading to an increased antimicrobial activity, a process termed&#xD;
      'trained immunity'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study the investigators recently investigated whether BCG could induce innate&#xD;
      immune training in seniors above 50 years of age in Guinea-Bissau. Two months after&#xD;
      vaccination, BCG recipients had increased release of the pro-inflammatory innate cytokines&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α to non-specific stimuli. These effects were more&#xD;
      pronounced among those with a positive Quantiferon test at baseline. Thus, BCG vaccination&#xD;
      can induce a 'trained immunity' phenotype in older adults. including previously Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis exposed individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, numerous clinical trials are investigating the effect of BCG as a prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment for health care workers of all ages. No results of these trials are available yet,&#xD;
      but ecological analyses have suggested that countries with a functioning BCG vaccination&#xD;
      program have lower COVID-19 mortality. Furthermore, in a very recent follow-up study of three&#xD;
      cohorts of healthy volunteers who either received BCG in the last five years or not, BCG&#xD;
      vaccination was safe and not associated with increased incidence of symptoms during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. In fact, BCG vaccination was associated with a decrease&#xD;
      in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (adjusted odds ratio 0.58, P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination may strengthen the immune system of the&#xD;
      senior citizens and may (partially) protect against getting infected and/or experiencing&#xD;
      severe morbidity due to infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary objective: To reduce senior citizens' risk of acute infection during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives: To reduce senior citizens' risk of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce senior citizens' risk of self-reported&#xD;
      respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS BCG vaccination of seniors will reduce the risk of acute infection by 25% over a&#xD;
      period of 12 months.&#xD;

      Madsen (MD, PhD student), Mette Bliddal (PhD), Sebastian Nielsen (MSc, statistician), and&#xD;
      Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer (MD, PhD), all from University of Southern Denmark. Lene Annette&#xD;

&#xD;
      METHODS Study design and follow-up A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 12 months post-randomization with respect to illness,&#xD;
      medical contacts, use of antibiotics, hospitalization and death. The follow-up will take&#xD;
      place both through self-reporting, and through the Danish National Registers. Information on&#xD;
      hospitalizations for infections and other medical conditions will be obtained through&#xD;
      Denmark's National Patient Register and information on use of antibiotics from the Danish&#xD;
      Prescription Register. Vaccination history will be acquired from the Danish Vaccination&#xD;
      Registry at Statens Serum Institut. Furthermore, data on testing for SARS-CoV-2 and results&#xD;
      will be obtained via the local department of clinical microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), the BCG vaccine, is used in this study on&#xD;
      another indication than the one it has been approved for, this is classified as a phase III&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receiving an intradermal BCG vaccine or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized in the active arm will receive a BCG vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ&#xD;
      Vaccines, http://www.produktresume.dk/AppBuilder/login.html). The BCG vaccines will be&#xD;
      handled in full compliance with the requirements of the Summary of Product Characteristics&#xD;
      (SPC). Placebo will be 0.1 ml sterile 0.9 % NaCl, which has a similar color as the&#xD;
      resuspended BCG vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive one injection at inclusion. No further treatment of study&#xD;
      participants will take place. BCG will be administered in the upper arm, intradermally, 0.1&#xD;
      ml of the suspended vaccine. Placebo will be administered in the upper arm, intradermally,&#xD;
      0.1 ml of sterile 0.9 % NaCl solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES The trial will be presented at information meetings and in relevant media,&#xD;
      local newspapers and homepages and newsletters of the activity houses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Citizens wishing to participate will be given written information and will be booked for an&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of inclusion (day 0) Study physicians, who are trained in good clinical practice and in&#xD;
      providing intradermal vaccines, will be responsible for the inclusion of study participants.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Background information on&#xD;
      participants will be collected in an electronic case report form system (REDCap). A blood&#xD;
      sample of 5 ml will be drawn for subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding The study will be individually randomized, and placebo controlled.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done using the REDCap tool with stratification per sex and age groups&#xD;
      (65-74/75+ years of age) in randomly selected block sizes of 4 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be blinded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of inclusion till end of trial A short electronic questionnaire regarding health,&#xD;
      symptoms and potential side effects will be sent to the participants biweekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of trial Participants are asked to fill in a final questionnaire. A blood sample of 5 ml&#xD;
      will be drawn for subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the trial is defined as whichever comes latest: The last participants last&#xD;
      registration in the online data collection, or 365 days. When the study is ended, all&#xD;
      participants receive an email with information about the intervention that they have received&#xD;
      (BCG/placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary endpoint &quot;acute infection&quot; will be analyzed as a recurrent&#xD;
      time-to-event using an Andersen-Gill Cox proportional hazards regression model with time&#xD;
      since inclusion as underlying time scale. Analyses will be done stratified by the block&#xD;
      randomization variables sex and age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint self-reported respiratory illness will be analyzed the same way as the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. The other secondary outcome verified SARS-CoV-2 infection will be analyzed&#xD;
      in a standard Cox proportional hazards model, but otherwise as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When applicable (i.e. in the event that one or more participants have died during the&#xD;
      follow-up period) a competing events analysis will be performed in addition (Fine-Gray&#xD;
      model).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION With an expected incidence of &quot;acute infection&quot; of 20% the trial can&#xD;
      show a 25% reduction in the risk of acute infection in the intervention group versus the&#xD;
      placebo group by including a total of 1890 individuals, 945 individuals in each group.&#xD;
