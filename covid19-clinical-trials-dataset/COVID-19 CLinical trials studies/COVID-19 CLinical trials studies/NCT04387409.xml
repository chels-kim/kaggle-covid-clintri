    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether vaccination of healthcare professionals with&#xD;
      VPM1002 could reduce the number of days absent from work due to respiratory disease (with or&#xD;
      without documented SARS-CoV-2 infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002 is a vaccine that is a further development of the old Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)&#xD;
      vaccine, which has been used successfully as a vaccine against tuberculosis for about 100&#xD;
      years, especially in developing countries. VPM1002 has been shown in various clinical studies&#xD;
      to be significantly safer than the BCG vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002 strengthens the body's immune defence and vaccination with BCG reduces the frequency&#xD;
      of respiratory diseases. It is therefore assumed that a VPM1002 vaccination could also&#xD;
      provide (partial) protection against COVID-19 disease caused by the new corona virus&#xD;
      &quot;SARS-CoV 2&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1200 health care professionals (doctors, nurses and paramedical staff) with high&#xD;
      expected exposure to SARSCoV-2 infected patients will receive a single dose of either VPM1002&#xD;
      or Placebo. All subjects will be requested to enter data regarding absenteeism, adverse&#xD;
      events / serious adverse events, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions into an&#xD;
      online questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the evidence that BCG vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. can potentiate immune responses to other vaccines through induction of trained innate&#xD;
           immunity and heterologous adaptive immunity and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. can reduce the incidence of respiratory infections, exert antiviral effects in&#xD;
           experimental models, and reduce viremia in an experimental human model of viral&#xD;
           infection,&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that BCG vaccination may induce (partial) protection against the&#xD;
      susceptibility to and/or severity of SARS- CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPM1002 is being developed with the aim to replace BCG by a vaccine that has a better safety&#xD;
      profile and superior efficacy. Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate&#xD;
      that VPM1002 is safer and is more immunogenic than the existing BCG vaccine. It is therefore&#xD;
      anticipated that VPM1002 will also perform better in reducing the severity of the symptoms of&#xD;
      an infection with the SARS CoV-2 than the BCG vaccine. Further, manufacturing of VPM1002&#xD;
      using state-of-the-art production methods will help hasten the production of millions of&#xD;
      doses in a very short time and thus would be beneficial in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial will assess the efficacy and safety of VPM1002 to reduce health care&#xD;
      professionals ' absenteeism in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by modulating the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1200 health care professionals (doctors, nurses and paramedical staff) with high&#xD;
      expected exposure to SARSCoV-2 infected patients (e.g. those employed in emergency&#xD;
      departments, intensive care unit, infectious disease ward, COVID-19 isolation wards,&#xD;
      respiratory wards, etc.) will be enrolled, across hospitals in Germany. Informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from the subjects willing to take part in the trial. This will be followed by&#xD;
      assessment of the eligibility criteria. Subjects who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either VPM1002 or&#xD;
      Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be requested to sign into a web-based tool designed for this trial. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed-up entirely remotely. The web-based questionnaires will be designed&#xD;
      to collect data regarding absenteeism, adverse events / serious adverse events,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and other secondary endpoints. The&#xD;
      investigators will review the outcome and safety data.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>There is uncertainty whether the European Union General Data Protection Regulation allows dissemination of individual participant data to other researchers. Some reasons why the EU Regulation would not allow this are the lack of suitable safeguards when person data are transferred to any researcher asking for it and the impairment of the rights of the subjects for erasure of their data once they are disseminated.</ipd_description>
