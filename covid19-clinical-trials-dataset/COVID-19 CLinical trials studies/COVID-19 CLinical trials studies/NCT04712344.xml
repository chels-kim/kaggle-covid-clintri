      The primary objective of the study is the assessment of impact of immune therapy with&#xD;
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma on severity of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives is the Impact of immune therapy with COVID-19 convalescent plasma on&#xD;
      markers for ARDS due to severe COVID-19 infection; short-term all-cause mortality; time&#xD;
      course of ARDS due to severe COVID-19 and assessment of safety and tolerability of immune&#xD;
      therapy with COVID-19 convalescent plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary endpoint/variable we will assess change in SOFA score from Baseline Visit to Day&#xD;
      8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled and&#xD;
      parallel-grouped.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score predicts Predicts ICU mortality based on lab results and clinical data. SOFA includes PaO2, the Glasgow Coma Scale, Mean arterial pressure OR Administration of sedatives, Bilirubin(mg/dl), Creatinine (mg/dl) and platelets. All values are rated with a value of 1 to 4 (worst condition) and are added up gradually to a final score. The lower the SOFA score, the better is the prognosis (Maximum value 24)</description>
