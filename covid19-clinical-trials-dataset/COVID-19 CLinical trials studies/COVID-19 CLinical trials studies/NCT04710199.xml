  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maraviroc (MVC) is a drug, very well tolerated, it has been seen that MVC has properties of&#xD;
      modulating the immune system, exerting an anti-inflammatory effect in different diseases. In&#xD;
      COVID-19, very high levels of inflammation occur that cause organs and systems to be damaged.&#xD;
      MVC could reduce this inflammation achieving a better prognosis of COVID-19.&#xD;

      In this clinical trial the investigators want to evaluate if standard treatment together with&#xD;
      Maraviroc (MVC) compared to standard treatment alone, achieves better clinical evolution in&#xD;
      participants hospitalized for COVID-19.&#xD;
