    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research program is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care program. In this study, we examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      such a program, called the Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care (TECC) for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      designed to support patients with diabetes and mental health concerns during COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing concern regarding the impact of COVID-19 and social isolation on mental&#xD;
      health and wellbeing, particularly adults living with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), who are at&#xD;
      greater risk for mental health issues than the general population. Self-management education&#xD;
      and support for healthy eating, physical activity, glucose monitoring, medication adherence&#xD;
      and problem solving are vital components of diabetes care. Due to social distancing and&#xD;
      limited care and resources, that are likely to persist in the post pandemic phase other&#xD;
      innovative service models should be developed and adopted to improve service delivery. The&#xD;
      overall goal of this research program is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care program. In this study, we examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      such a program, called the Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care (TECC) for T2DM designed to&#xD;
      support patients with diabetes and mental health concerns during COVID-19.&#xD;

    <description>The Care Coordinator (CC) will provide brief coaching sessions (15 to 20 minutes) to each participant once per week for 8 weeks. Participants can identify topics for discussion and the CC and participant can decide if a video session via WebEx is required versus a phone call. Also, participants will be given peer support and will be indirectly monitored by a virtual care team of experts.</description>
