    <textblock>
      Phase III, two-group multicentre, randomised controlled trial in up to 10 078 healthcare&#xD;
      workers to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 during&#xD;
      the 2020 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers are at the frontline of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. They&#xD;
      will be randomised to receive a single dose of BCG vaccine or 0.9% NaCl placebo. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed-up for 12 months with notification from a Smartphone application or phone&#xD;
      calls (up to daily when ill) and surveys to identify and detail COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
      Additional information on severe disease will be obtained from hospital medical records&#xD;
      and/or government databases. Blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and at 3,&#xD;
      6, 9 and 12 months to determine exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2). Where required, swab/blood samples will be taken at illness episodes to assess&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes a pre-planned meta-analysis with data from 2834 participants recruited in&#xD;
      the first phase of this study, where participants were randomised to receive BCG or no BCG&#xD;
      vaccine at the time of receiving influenza vaccination.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The control group will receive a placebo of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Members of the research team doing the follow-up of participants and analysis will be blinded to the group allocation (by the removal of this variable and all other variables related to BCG from the dataset) until the formal detailed statistical analysis plan is confirmed and signed by all investigators and all data cleaning/preparation is complete.</masking_description>

                       non-biological immunosuppressant (also known as 'DMARDS'), biological agents&#xD;
                       (such as monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  People with congenital cellular immunodeficiencies, including specific&#xD;
                  deficiencies of the interferon-gamma pathway&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Known or suspected HIV infection,even if they are asymptomatic or have normal&#xD;
                  immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This is because of the risk of disseminated BCG infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  People with active skin disease such as eczema, dermatitis or psoriasis at or&#xD;
                  near the site of vaccination&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Although there is no evidence that BCG vaccination is harmful during&#xD;
                       pregnancy, it is a contra-indication to BCG vaccination. Therefore, we will&#xD;
                       exclude women who think they could be pregnant or are planning to become&#xD;
                       pregnant within the next month.&#xD;

                       during pregnancy, it is a contra-indication to BCG vaccination. Therefore,&#xD;
                       we will exclude women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who think they could&#xD;
                       be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Spain specific: If the patient is female, and of childbearing potential, she&#xD;
                       must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of inclusion and practice a&#xD;
                       reliable method of birth control for 30 days after receiving the BCG&#xD;

               -  Require another live vaccine to be administered within the month following BCG&#xD;
                  randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If the other live vaccine can be given on the same day, this exclusion&#xD;
                       criteria does not apply&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredients present in the BCG vaccine&#xD;
