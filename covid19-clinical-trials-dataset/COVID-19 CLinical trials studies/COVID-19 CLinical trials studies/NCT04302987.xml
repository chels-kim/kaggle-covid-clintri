  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to vitamin D intervention in early life may have permanent effects on physiology and&#xD;
      metabolism. Bone growth and mineralization, development of immunity, body composition and&#xD;
      brain structure and functioning may be affected. The importance of a long-term surveillance&#xD;
      includes follow-up of both beneficial but also harmful effects of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D intervention in infants (VIDI) study was conducted in 2013-2016. VIDI study was a&#xD;
      large randomized trial that aimed to evaluate effects of two vitamin D supplemental doses of&#xD;
      daily 10 ug and 30 ug from the age 2 weeks until 2 years on bone strength, infections,&#xD;
      immunity, allergy, atopy and asthma, neurologic and cognitive development, and genetic&#xD;
      regulation of mineral homeostasis. Current study is a 6 Years Follow-up (VIDI2) study of the&#xD;
      original VIDI trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our focuses of interest in the follow-up are: bone strength, growth pattern, body&#xD;
      composition, and morbidity due to infections and allergic diseases, and the development of&#xD;
      immunity. Further, in addition to more classical associates of vitamin D, our aim is to&#xD;
      continue to follow-up children's neurocognitive development and mental health. We will also&#xD;
      focus on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on occurrence of molar-incisor&#xD;
      hypomineralization, dental caries, and oral immunity.&#xD;
