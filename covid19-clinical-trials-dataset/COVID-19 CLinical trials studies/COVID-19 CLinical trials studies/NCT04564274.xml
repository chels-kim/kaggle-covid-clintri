      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID. It has caused a global pandemic. Most people have&#xD;
      no to mild symptoms. But some people need to be hospitalized, and a small number need&#xD;
      critical care. Older age as well as some socio-demographic factors and chronic health&#xD;
      conditions may play a role in the severity of COVID. In this study, researchers want to&#xD;
      assess population-, disease-, and gene-based risks for features associated with severe&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the frequency and severity of COVID infection in people with rare and common&#xD;
      diseases, looking for conditions that increase risk of severe outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People greater than 1 month of age, both with and without rare disease, who have access to&#xD;
      the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit a website. They will fill out a survey. It should take less than 30&#xD;
      minutes to complete. They will answer questions about their current health and COVID&#xD;
      exposures. They will answer questions about their demographic and location features that may&#xD;
      impact their exposure to the virus. All questions are optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may repeat the survey in 6 to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants medical records may be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted for future studies related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their underlying health conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A new exposure that is being studied.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will collect information on frequency and severity of COVID infection for&#xD;
      patients with rare diseases and community controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To quantify the frequency and severity of COVID infection in patients with&#xD;
      rare and common diseases, looking for conditions that increase risk of severe outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To identify gene-, tissue- or sociodemographic level features that&#xD;
      increase risk of severe COVID outcomes that may inform future genetic modifier studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Frequency of severe infection (hospitalization +/- ICU stay and/or&#xD;
      COVID-related death) secondary to COVID in patients with a shared disease designation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Frequency of severe infection (hospitalization +/- ICU stay and/or&#xD;
      COVID-related death) secondary to COVID in patients with shared organ system involvement,&#xD;
      secondary comorbidities, or sociodemographic differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AND Frequency of any infection secondary to COVID in study patients as grouped by genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis, organ system involvement, secondary comorbidities, or sociodemographic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include people greater than 1 month old, with and without rare disease. Some&#xD;
      members of the study population have cognitive impairment on the basis of their rare disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consent and study procedures/questionnaire will be performed online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll for up to 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, participants (or their legal authorized representative) will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out an online questionnaire that should take &lt;30 minutes. We may re-send the survey to the&#xD;
      participants in 6 - 12 months. Filling out the second round questionnaire is preferred but&#xD;
      not required. New enrollees at the time the 2nd questionnaire is sent will fill out the&#xD;
      questionnaire once at Time 2. Participants will be consented for re-contact.&#xD;

        Study groups (those being reported upon) include those with known rare medical conditions&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The person being reported upon must be 1 month of age or older. The reporter must have&#xD;
        access to the internet and be able to read and answer questions in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals unwilling to allow sharing of their research data should not participate. With&#xD;
        the use of online consents for large numbers of individuals, opting in or out of sharing&#xD;
        for this low risk study creates a burden for this research study as well as the ability to&#xD;
        share data with other related research studies for meta-analysis.&#xD;
