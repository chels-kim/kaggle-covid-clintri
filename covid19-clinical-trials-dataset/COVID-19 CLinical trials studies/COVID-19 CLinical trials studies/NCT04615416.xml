      This study is an open trial designed specifically to address the need for evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment delivered via telehealth to individuals that are currently struggling with mental&#xD;
      health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the overarching goal of helping residents of&#xD;
      New York adversely impacted by the pandemic to effectively manage their anxiety, stress, and&#xD;
      depression during this unprecedented time in human history.&#xD;

      The present study is evaluating whether this ERT treatment program delivered via telehealth&#xD;
      demonstrates efficacy in: 1) reducing symptoms of psychological distress (e.g., anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, worry, rumination); 2) improving outcomes specific to the ERT mechanism-based&#xD;
      model (e.g., attentional control, decentering, reappraisal); 3) improving quality of life and&#xD;
      functioning, for adults aged 18-65 years old.&#xD;

    <description>The initial stage of treatment focuses on psychoeducation about anxiety/depression, the impact that these cognitions/behaviors/emotions have on recent situations, and self-monitoring of worry/anxiety/depression. The sessions focus on the development of skills that help understand and regulate one's emotional experience (i.e., recognizing emotions when they are happening, identifying the meaning of a given emotion experience, soothing oneself in the context of negative emotional experiences). Following the development of these skills, sessions focus on the application of somatic awareness and emotion regulation skills while imagining emotionally evocative themes. The remaining session focuses on terminating therapy, relapse prevention, and future goals. An Internet-based online platform will be used to promote engagement with and increase accessibility to between-session skills practice and treatment-related activities (e.g., self-monitoring, session summaries, worksheets).</description>
