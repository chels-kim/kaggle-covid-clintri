    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the kinetics of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well&#xD;
      as the kinetics of the immune system's cell subpopulations and cytokines associated with the&#xD;
      immune system in healthy volunteers receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 of the&#xD;
      Pfizer/BioNTech companies or any other vaccine authorized and administered by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health. Immunoassays will be performed at serum collection points before and after&#xD;
      vaccination, as set out in this study.&#xD;
