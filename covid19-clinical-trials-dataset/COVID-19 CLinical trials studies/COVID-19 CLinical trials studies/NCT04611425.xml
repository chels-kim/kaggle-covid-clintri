  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the number of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in intensive care units for an acute respiratory failure in all countries. This&#xD;
      situation has quickly led to massive shortage in masks, mechanical ventilation machines and&#xD;
      common medications such as hypnotics. All countries over the world are currently experiencing&#xD;
      a major shortage in basic hypnotic medications (propofol, midazolam) in the intensive care as&#xD;
      well as in the operating theatre. The Principal Investigator proposes to perform a pilot&#xD;
      study assessing the benefit-risk ratio of Remimazolam (a novel benzodiazepine with a short&#xD;
      half-life) in the critical care units of Nantes University Hospital during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

      The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the number of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in intensive care units for an acute respiratory failure in all countries. This&#xD;
      situation has quickly led to massive shortage in masks, mechanical ventilation machines and&#xD;
      common medications such as hypnotics. The reasons for such shortage are multiple: dramatic&#xD;
      increase of the demand, production discontinuation because of shutdowns in multiple&#xD;
      countries, and withholding of products by producing countries. All countries over the world&#xD;
      are currently experiencing a major shortage in basic hypnotic medications (propofol,&#xD;
      midazolam) in the intensive care as well as in the operating theatre. Remimazolam is a novel&#xD;
      benzodiazepine with a short half-life that has been administered in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery, as well as in the intensive care unit. The Principal Investigator proposes to&#xD;
      perform a pilot study assessing the benefit-risk ratio of Remimazolam in the critical care&#xD;
      units of Nantes University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

    <description>For Safety: Cardiovascular event: Hypotension will be defined as a Mean Arterial Pressure ≤65mmHg or an increase ≥50% of the dose of norepinephrine (if appropriate), sustained over one hour after the beginning of Remimazolam.&#xD;
For Efficacy: Sedation event: the investigator will check if Remimazolam provides an adequate level of sedation assessed with the Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale. The level of sedation will be set by the attending physician and is usually set at-1/0. The investigator will also monitor the need to use standard hypnotic drugs within this time frame as further medication (propofol, midazolam, dexmedetomidine) in case of Remimazolam inefficacy (Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale).</description>

    <description>Patients will receive an infusion of Remimazolam for a maximum duration of 48 hours. The dose of Remimazolam will be adapted according to the ICU units protocol of analgesia-sedation management, based on validated scale (Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale). Owing to previous data gathered through a previous study in Japan, the initial dose of infusion will be within a 0.2-0.5 mg/min range. The dose of Remimazolam can be increased or decreased by 0.1mg/min when needed. The maximum dose of Remimazolam will be set at 1 mg/min.</description>
