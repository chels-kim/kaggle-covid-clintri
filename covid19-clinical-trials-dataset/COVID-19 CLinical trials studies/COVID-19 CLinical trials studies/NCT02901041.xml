  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholism is the third leading cause of preventable death in the US, accounting for 80,000&#xD;
      deaths annually. Almost 18 million US adults have alcohol use disorder (AUD); however,&#xD;
      approved medications for the treatment of AUD has shown limited effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zonisamide (ZON), a broad spectrum anticonvulsant, has proven to be more effective than a&#xD;
      placebo in reducing alcohol intake in individuals with alcohol dependence. ZON's mechanism of&#xD;
      action seems to be quite distinct from currently approved anti-alcoholism medications, which&#xD;
      holds promise for treatment of individuals who are not responsive to conventional&#xD;
      medications. However, much remains unknown about ZON's therapeutic mechanisms and ZON's&#xD;
      efficacy in treating patients with a diagnosis of AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fill in these gaps, the investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      study that assesses ZON's treatment mechanisms and effectiveness in reducing alcohol&#xD;
      consumption in patients with AUD. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions:&#xD;
      1) treatment with ZON and a computerized psychotherapy platform called Take Control (TC); 2)&#xD;
      treatment with a placebo (PLC) and TC. To understand the neurobiology behind ZON's potential&#xD;
      therapeutic effects on AUD, fMRI will be used to compare the brain activity of the ZON+TC&#xD;
      versus PLC+TC group while participants perform an alcohol and emotional-word Stroop task, as&#xD;
      well as an alcohol related cues task.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will complete a telephone and an in-clinic screening to determine&#xD;
      eligibility for this study. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive one of two&#xD;
      treatment conditions: 1) Zonisamide plus Take Control (a computerized alcohol reduction and&#xD;
      medication compliance program developed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and&#xD;
      Alcoholism (NIAAA)); 2) a placebo plus Take Control. For both conditions, participants will&#xD;
      receive 12 treatment sessions. Participants will receive medication at each session, and they&#xD;
      should have two weeks worth of medication on hand at any given time. Participants will take&#xD;
      the medication as prescribed at home. The first 11 treatment sessions will include Take&#xD;
      Control. The 12 treatment sessions will be followed by two drug dose taper sessions, and a&#xD;
      follow up phone interview immediately following the final session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also undergo two scans of less than 2 hours duration, one before they begin&#xD;
      study sessions and the second near the end of the study (12th study week and before the&#xD;
      medication taper). At the in-clinic screening session, participants will receive a &quot;MRI&#xD;
      Information for Research Participants&quot; handout that answers some commonly asked questions&#xD;
      about MRI and tells participants what they can expect while undergoing an MRI scan. Both&#xD;
      scans will be conducted at BU CILSE. Participants will be screened before each scan session&#xD;
      for pregnancy (urine sample, women of childbearing potential only), recent smoking or alcohol&#xD;
      use (breathalyzers), and illicit substance use (urine sample). Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) before and after the scan. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will complete a 1-hour 3 Tesla MRI scan involving structural imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      functional imaging (fMRI). The fMRI scans include a resting-state scan (no task involved) a&#xD;
      cognitive (Stroop) task, and an alcohol cue reactivity task. The latter two scans involve&#xD;
      presentation of visual images to participants while they are in the scanner. No contrast&#xD;
      agent or invasive procedures are used. Only personnel trained in working in high magnetic&#xD;
      field environments will work on this project. Imaging data will be analyzed on secure&#xD;
      networks using only encrypted files. All data obtained will be coded to protect participant&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on March 23, 2020, all study procedures have been moved to HIPAA compliant, remote&#xD;
      platforms and can be performed from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Screenings will take&#xD;
      place over the phone or Zoom, neurocognitive assessments will take place on Inquisit 5 at&#xD;
      sessions 1 and 12, female participants of child-bearing potential will be directed to take a&#xD;
      pregnancy test at all sessions, and patients will use a breathalyzer provided by Boston&#xD;
      University at the start of each session to show they are within study-specified limits of&#xD;
      blood alcohol content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month following completion of study treatment (study week 16), participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a follow-up telephone assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study is estimated to be completed in five years. The first six months to nine&#xD;
      months of the project will be dedicated to hiring, training and certifying staff. Recruitment&#xD;
      will begin within three months of obtaining IRB approval, during Year 1 of the study.&#xD;
      Approximately 3-4 new participants will be recruited per month. We anticipate recruiting a&#xD;
      total of 5 participants in Year 1, 25 participants in Years 2 and 3, 30 participants in year&#xD;
      4, and 15 participants in Year 5. The last third of Year 5 will be devoted to completion of&#xD;
      data entry and data management procedures, preliminary analyses, and the preparation of&#xD;
      manuscripts&#xD;
