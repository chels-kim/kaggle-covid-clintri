    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in&#xD;
      RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a companion study to CIR 313.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study&#xD;
      evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSV&#xD;
      D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII, a recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, in RSV-seronegative&#xD;
      infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo (administered as nose drops) at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants could be enrolled in the study outside of RSV season (between April 1 and&#xD;
      October 14 for most sites or-for sites with local RSV seasons that start earlier-as specified&#xD;
      on a site-by-site basis in the Manual Of Procedures). All participants remained on study&#xD;
      until they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1 and April 30 in the calendar&#xD;
      year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration was between 6 and 13 months,&#xD;
      depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants attended several study visits&#xD;
      throughout the study, which included physical examinations, blood collection, and nasal&#xD;
      washes. Participants' parents or guardians were contacted by study staff at various times&#xD;
      during the study to monitor participants' health.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited adverse events included fever; otitis media; upper respiratory illness (URI); lower respiratory illness (LRI) and cough (without LRI). The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each solicited AE category, and that was in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. These events were graded (Grade 1-mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) following protocol-defined grading system outlined in Table 3 and Table 4 in the protocol document.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unsolicited AEs by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited adverse events were other events, not included in the solicited AEs. The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each unsolicited AE category, and that was in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. AE grading (Grade 1- mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) was done by DAIDS AE Grading table v2.0 (see References).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Day 0 through Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE, whether considered related to the study product or not, that:&#xD;
Resulted in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance&#xD;
Was life threatening: defined as an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it did not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death were it more severe&#xD;
Required inpatient hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization): defined as at least an overnight stay in the hospital or emergency ward for treatment that would have been inappropriate if administered in the outpatient setting&#xD;
Resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
Was a congenital anomaly or birth defect&#xD;
Was an important medical event that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured from November 1st through participant's post-RSV season surveillance visit</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who had RSV-associated, medically attended, acute respiratory illness (RSV-MAARI) or RSV-associated, medically attended, acute lower respiratory illness (RSV-MAALRI) among those who had RSV detected in nasal washes or greater than or equal to 4 fold rise in serum antibodies during the subsequent RSV season were presented.</description>

    <description>Only participants who had RSV detected in nasal washes or a greater than or equal to 4-fold rise in serum antibodies during the subsequent RSV season were included. RSV-neutralizing antibody titers were measured pre- and post-RSV surveillance season.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With B Cell Responses to Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at day 0 and Day 56</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Mucosal Antibody Responses to Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Day 0, 28 and 56</time_frame>
    <description>Determined from nasal wash samples. Reliably quantifying RSV specific antibodies in dilute nasal washes and SAM strips continues to be difficult. We were working on upgrading to a next-generation assay reader with superior sensitivity, and we have improved a DELFIA assay. Due to these challenges, as well as the COVID pandemic (with closures and reduced personnel), the final results are not available at this time. The results will be posted when available, after passing quality assurance and control reviews at the testing laboratory and at the data management center.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) by Grade</title>
        <description>Solicited adverse events included fever; otitis media; upper respiratory illness (URI); lower respiratory illness (LRI) and cough (without LRI). The number of participants who experienced solicited adverse events was presented. A participant was only counted once in each solicited AE category, and that was in the line corresponding to the highest grade adverse event they had in that category. These events were graded (Grade 1-mild to Grade 4-life-threatening) following protocol-defined grading system outlined in Table 3 and Table 4 in the protocol document.</description>

Required inpatient hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization): defined as at least an overnight stay in the hospital or emergency ward for treatment that would have been inappropriate if administered in the outpatient setting&#xD;

        <title>Frequency of Mucosal Antibody Responses to Vaccine</title>
        <description>Determined from nasal wash samples. Reliably quantifying RSV specific antibodies in dilute nasal washes and SAM strips continues to be difficult. We were working on upgrading to a next-generation assay reader with superior sensitivity, and we have improved a DELFIA assay. Due to these challenges, as well as the COVID pandemic (with closures and reduced personnel), the final results are not available at this time. The results will be posted when available, after passing quality assurance and control reviews at the testing laboratory and at the data management center.</description>
