        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be at least 65 years old and be admitted to the Geriatrics Unit of the Internal&#xD;
             Medicine Service (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona) or to a transicional care center&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis compatible with COVID-19 (in a favourable epidemiological context),&#xD;
             with a disease considered moderate (grade 3-4) or severe (grade 5) according to the&#xD;
             WHO 8-point ordinal scale for assessing clinical severity&#xD;
             (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-therapeutic-trial-synopsis). This&#xD;
             same scale will also be used to evaluate the evolution after the application of the&#xD;
             corresponding treatment. Baseline clinical parameters will include the presentation of&#xD;
             fever and any respiratory symptoms, both of upper respiratory tract and dyspnea,&#xD;
             affecting the general state or gastrointestinal manifestations, since it is known that&#xD;
             in elderly people the COVID-19 can present with atypical symptoms for a time that is&#xD;
             difficult to determine, but it also tends to evolve to respiratory failure quickly and&#xD;
             is associated with high mortality. For this reason, regardless of the time that has&#xD;
             elapsed since the estimated onset of symptoms, patients with moderate - WHO grade 3,&#xD;
             in whom the presence of fever, mild dyspnea or any gastrointestinal manifestation&#xD;
             attributable to COVID-19 make an admission (in the case of hospital) and directed&#xD;
             treatment (in all cases) advisable, will be candidates for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
             Patients with moderate disease and oxygen requirements (WHO grade 4) and patients with&#xD;
             severe pneumonia, but who can be managed initially with high flow oxygen therapy (WHO&#xD;
             grade 5) may also be included in the study. The clinical diagnosis may be supported by&#xD;
             radiological changes (via chest radiography, if available) suggestive of bilateral&#xD;
             (established or incipient) pneumonia. At the time of diagnosis, biomarkers will also&#xD;
             be collected, in an analysis that will include increased levels of C-reactive protein&#xD;
             [PCR] and/or ferritin and microbiological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients in whom the current clinical situation and the basal functional situation&#xD;
             condition a prognosis that makes them consider a limited therapeutic ceiling, which&#xD;
             includes the contraindication of applying more aggressive (e.g. non-invasive&#xD;
             ventilation) or invasive measures (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation or orotracheal&#xD;
             intubation and mechanical ventilation), both in patients admitted to the Geriatric&#xD;
             Unit (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona) and in those admitted to a transicional care&#xD;
             center. The latter patients are also not considered for transfer to a third level&#xD;
             hospital (according to the criteria of fragility, available on page 14 of the CatSalut&#xD;
             action protocols&#xD;
             (https://canalsalut.gencat.cat/web/.content/_A-Z/C/coronavirus-2019-ncov/material-divu&#xD;
             lgatiu/recull-protocol-pneumonia.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient with a general condition that allows him/her to take the medication orally,&#xD;
             without risk of bronchial aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Acceptance by the patient or responsible family member to participate in the study&#xD;
             (written consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The clinical situation of an advanced or terminal illness, according to the clinical&#xD;
             judgment of the doctor in charge and as defined by the Spanish Society for Palliative&#xD;
             Care (SECPAL), which describes it as an advanced illness in an evolutionary and&#xD;
             irreversible phase with multiple symptoms, emotional impact, loss of autonomy, with&#xD;
             very little or no capacity to respond to specific treatment and with a life expectancy&#xD;
             limited to weeks or months, in a context of progressive fragility&#xD;
             (http://envejecimiento.csic.es/documentos/documentos/navarro-cuidadospaliativos-01.pdf&#xD;
             ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical status which is advanced and severe or in which the level of consciousness&#xD;
             has deteriorated and the oral route of taking the medication is not safely tolerated&#xD;
             (in the opinion of the doctor in charge)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Taking any of the drugs in the trial (colchicine or prednisone) chronically or&#xD;
             intermittently in the 7 days prior to study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Absolute contraindication to the use of the study medication, including&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its excipients, severe renal&#xD;
             failure (glomerular filtration [GF] creatinine clearance or Clcr &lt;30 ml/min) and&#xD;
             patients undergoing haemodialysis, severe liver failure, severe gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disorders, gastric ulcer or blood dyscrasias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concomitant treatment with macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin),&#xD;
             antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), cyclosporine and antivirals&#xD;
             (lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), all potent inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 (key cytochrome in the colchicine metabolism pathway).&#xD;
