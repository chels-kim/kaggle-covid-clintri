  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus usual care compared to usual care in approximately 350&#xD;
      hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study will be a 2-arm, non-blinded&#xD;
      comparison between open label hydroxychloroquine and usual care. The course of treatment&#xD;
      (HCQ) is five days. Participants will be followed to study day 28.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      (HCQ) relative to standard of care among 350 hospitalized adult patients who have COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim i. Clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Status 7-point ordinal scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment and randomization there will be baseline and then daily assessments of&#xD;
      clinical status and test results and procedures during hospitalization. Course of HCQ&#xD;
      treatment is 5 days. Participants are followed daily during hospitalization. All procedures,&#xD;
      evaluations and treatment, including the hydroxychloroquine laboratory tests, and radiology&#xD;
      tests are part of the usual clinical care for COVID-19 patients. This study will only collect&#xD;
      the information obtained as part of hospital standard of care. If the information is not&#xD;
      available, it will not be obtained by any other mechanism. After discharge there is a follow&#xD;
      up telephone call at day 15 and day 28. Follow-up assessment includes any clinical events,&#xD;
      adverse events, and clinic or emergency visits or hospitalizations. Participants in the HCQ&#xD;
      arm have safety labs: CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic profile scheduled on day 7 and 14.&#xD;
