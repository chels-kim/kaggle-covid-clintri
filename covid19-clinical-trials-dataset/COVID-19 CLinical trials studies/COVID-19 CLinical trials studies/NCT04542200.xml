  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal, with this study, is to leverage Northwell Health System's diverse workforce and&#xD;
      robust testing structures, to contribute data-driven, evidence-based strategies to better&#xD;
      understand the sustained prevalence of antibodies and how conferred immunity may be modified&#xD;
      by environmental factors. The objective is to investigate the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 disease&#xD;
      prevalence and trajectory over time, by conducting follow-up antibody testing on employees&#xD;
      who consented to participate in research during the initial workforce offering. From 70,812&#xD;
      employees contacted, 46,117 were tested and received initial results. Of those participants,&#xD;
      approximately, 32,000 agreed to be re-contacted, and 34,000 consented to research. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct an additional five rounds of testing that would sample&#xD;
      individuals over a two-year period. This study is significant because it leverages Northwell&#xD;
      Health's advanced laboratory systems to conduct serosurveillance of antibodies to&#xD;
      COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 across a large and diverse workforce, while taking into account the&#xD;
      contextual environmental and occupational exposures that may modify continued immunity to the&#xD;
      virus. Northwell Health's employee health services (EHS) is poised to act quickly to adapt&#xD;
      policies and practices, where needed, to protect the workforce. The study is also innovative&#xD;
      because it will be linking work environment and community measures with COVID-19 seropositive&#xD;
      prevalence patterns over time, to build a better understanding of the disease and its&#xD;
      controls at the population level. The expected outcomes include serial serology results as a&#xD;
      measure of full or partial short-term (6 months) and long-term (2 year) immunity to&#xD;
      re-infection and recognition of local environmental factors (e.g., building ventilation&#xD;
      rates, zip code, air quality indicators) that could modify this immunity and assist with&#xD;
      protecting the workforce and surrounding community. These results could inform national and&#xD;
      global policies.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to understand the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 disease incidence,&#xD;
      prevalence, and trajectory over time, by conducting follow-up antibody testing on employees&#xD;
      by first following up with the approximately 5,600 team members who were positive and then&#xD;
      extending the invitation to the remaining team members (approximately 65,212).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) Follow those who tested positive during prior institutional antibody testing to better&#xD;
      understand whether IgG or total antibody measures confer continued immunity; hypothesis 1 is&#xD;
      that prior infection will be protective and that restricting testing to prior positives,&#xD;
      reduces impact of false positive results due to low prevalence populations. Over a 1.5 year&#xD;
      period, testing will be repeated on seropositive individuals in January 2021, May 2021,&#xD;
      September of 2021, January 2022, and May 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be to document antibody seropositivity and continued presence of immunity&#xD;
      over time. The study investigators will invite those positive Northwell team members to&#xD;
      participate in a research study that has the aim of testing for continued presence of&#xD;
      antibodies to COVID-19, to understand trends over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) Continue to document seroconversion rates and distribution of exposure to COVID-19&#xD;
      across the entire remaining workforce; hypothesis 2 is that employees will have lower rates&#xD;
      than the general population, even though false positive serology results will be highly&#xD;
      dependent upon New York State positive prevalence rates. Over the same 1.5 year period as in&#xD;
      Aim 1, testing will be repeated for all workforce participants who previously tested negative&#xD;
      and others interested in participating for the first time in May 2021 (or September 2021) and&#xD;
      May 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) Track any associations between engineering, administrative, and personal protective&#xD;
      equipment (PPE) policies across the health system and whether these continue to be protective&#xD;
      and adapt to disease/viral behavior over time; hypothesis 3 is that Northwell Health policies&#xD;
      are proactive and protective and that co-exposures to environmental factors in the workplace&#xD;
      and community are measurable and remediable with respect to their effects on COVID-19&#xD;
      infection rates. The investigators propose to complete three things. First, they will be&#xD;
      linking job title, department, and industry codes from participant records, with occupational&#xD;
      indices of workplace exposure, such as O*Net. This will create a job or task exposure matrix&#xD;
      (JEM) for job groups in the Northwell Health system. This JEM will reflect conventional&#xD;
      understanding of job level exposure risk estimates to work stressors that may be physical&#xD;
      (e.g., heavy loads), psychosocial (e.g., job demand/control), noise, and chemical (e.g.,&#xD;
      peracetic acid cleaners). Second, they will link departmental level policy information on&#xD;
      personal protective equipment (PPE) for each job/task; administrative policies on work hours&#xD;
      for the job and chemicals used for infection control at the unit level; and engineering&#xD;
      (ventilation rates) at the building and unit level (e.g., air changes per hour and occupancy&#xD;
      limits). This institutional policy information will be gathered from January 2021 to each&#xD;
      wave of data collection. Any changes in policy will be documented and the most recent policy&#xD;
      will be linked with the job title information. Third, the investigators will integrate&#xD;
      community variable census information (at the census tract or zip code level) on neighborhood&#xD;
      air quality, poverty rates, language predominance, nativity (US or other), and household&#xD;
      density. The study will include travel distance to work and transportation mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that findings from this work, particularly from Aim 3, have&#xD;
      implications that extend to communities across New York State (Northwell Health is the&#xD;
      largest employer in New York and its employee residences and work locations span every&#xD;
      county). They also believe that this work has broader national and international relevance,&#xD;
      as the world continues global efforts to navigate a built environment in which SARS-CoV-2 now&#xD;
      exists in a pandemic. The strengths of this study are that it accesses a large population&#xD;
      sample of 70,812 people that is diverse and also self-contained, whereby, multiple work,&#xD;
      home, and environmental factors can be measured alongside trajectories in COVID-19&#xD;
      prevalence. The population is economically and culturally diverse, even by global standards,&#xD;
      and includes Queens County that has recorded some of the highest seropositivity rates to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
