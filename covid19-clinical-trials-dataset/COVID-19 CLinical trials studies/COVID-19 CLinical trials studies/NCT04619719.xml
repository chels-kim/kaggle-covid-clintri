  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the many treatments proposed for COVID-19, few directly address the severe hypoxia among&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. Interim results from our single-center, non-randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (NCT04332081) suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may reduce inpatient mortality or the&#xD;
      need for mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 patients by more than half. Hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      therapy is delivered by increasing the atmospheric pressure surrounding a patient, which&#xD;
      results in increased oxygen delivery to a patient's blood at a rate higher than any other&#xD;
      available modality. It is already FDA-approved for several indications, including conditions&#xD;
      with impaired gas exchange and severe infectious processes. Furthermore, several studies have&#xD;
      found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      which may play a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. The goal of this proposal is to&#xD;
      perform a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the short-term and long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for COVID-19 patients. This proposal will rigorously&#xD;
      test whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce the substantial mortality and morbidity of&#xD;
      this challenging disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive COVID 19 test or clear clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Positive COVID-19 test&#xD;
             will be confirmed based on a PCR test result or patient reported history. Clear&#xD;
             clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 will be a combination of respiratory symptoms and&#xD;
             clinical findings based on laboratory values and radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Respiratory compromise defined by a baseline supplemental oxygen requirement of 6&#xD;
             liters or higher as measured within the 24 hours before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Untreated pneumothorax, which should be evaluated with a baseline chest radiograph or&#xD;
             computerized tomography scan at least 72 hours prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, significant subcutaneous emphysema,&#xD;
             or pulmonary blebs, which should also be evaluated with a baseline chest radiograph&#xD;
             prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current non-invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;

             addition to any relative contraindications identified by the treating hyperbaric&#xD;
             physician or inpatient hospital team (e.g., severely impaired cardiac output due to&#xD;
             significant myocardial injury).&#xD;
