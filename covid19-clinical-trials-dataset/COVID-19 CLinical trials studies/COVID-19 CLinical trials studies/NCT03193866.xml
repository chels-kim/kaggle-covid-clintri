    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether rituximab (RTX) offers&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety advantages over other commonly used approved Disease-Modifying Drugs&#xD;
      (DMT) in the largest real-world population-based structured prospective follow-up cohort of&#xD;
      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients. The study will include both treatment&#xD;
      naïve patients starting their first DMT and patients switching from a previous first line DMT&#xD;
      (escalation/second-line).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-intervention observational prospective cohort study assessing the&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy of RTX treatment in MS compared with other common MS DMTs&#xD;
      regarding both clinical and radiological parameters in a real-life population of patients&#xD;
      with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of parameters will be assessed annually. These include baseline demographics,&#xD;
      previous drug history and reasons for discontinuation, disability status (expanded disability&#xD;
      status scale), relapses, safety and adverse events (AE), contrast enhancing T1 and newly&#xD;
      appearing T2 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as a panel of patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures: Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT); MS impact scale-29 (MSIS-29) Fatigue&#xD;
      Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), the MS check&#xD;
      scale and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (TSQM-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective data entered in medical charts and the Swedish MS registry will be included&#xD;
      together with prospective annual structured follow up from inclusion into the study for a&#xD;
      minimum of three years (three to nine years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a substudy - Covid Enhancement study - analyses will be performed regarding the effect of&#xD;
      COVID-19 on people with MS as compared to non-MS individuals and also if there is any&#xD;
      indication that a particular DMD is associated with a risk to contract a more severe&#xD;
      COVID-19. The analyses will primarily be performed in official health care databases.&#xD;

        All patients initiated at their first or second disease-modifying drug between January 1&#xD;
        2011 and June 30 2018 will be included in the trial. Up to present date, study-related data&#xD;
        will be retrospectively controlled via individual study of patient records. Patients will&#xD;
        be identified through the Swedish MS registry. Inclusion into the COMBAT-MS core study will&#xD;
        be subject to written informed consent. Given the non-intervention design of the study and&#xD;
        very limited study-specific procedures outside of clinical practise, we expect&#xD;
        participation rates to be very high. Based on preliminary calculations from the MS registry&#xD;
        the projected number of participants will be 3700 patients, out of which at least 1000 are&#xD;
        treated with rituximab first or second-line.&#xD;
