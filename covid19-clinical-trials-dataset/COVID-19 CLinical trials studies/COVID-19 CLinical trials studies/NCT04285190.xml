    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, blank-controlled treatment clinical study. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving oxygen saturation and clinical&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, estimated total&#xD;
      of 120-240 male and female patients who have been diagnosed with non-critical type of&#xD;
      coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study&#xD;
      groups, the T89 treatment group and the blank control group, to T89 or nothing on the base of&#xD;
      a recommended standard treatment for up to 14 days . The primary efficacy parameters include&#xD;
      the time to oxygen saturation recovery to normal level (≥97%), the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with normal level of oxygen saturation after treatment, and the total duration of oxygen&#xD;
      inhalation, oxygen flow change by time, oxygen concentration change by time during treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The breakout of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) begun in Wuhan of Hubei province in&#xD;
      China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16,&#xD;
      2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type&#xD;
      of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this&#xD;
      disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of&#xD;
      this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom,&#xD;
      such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will&#xD;
      also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe&#xD;
      patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid&#xD;
      progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock,&#xD;
      refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the &quot;Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)&quot; recently issued by National Health&#xD;
      Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close&#xD;
      monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine&#xD;
      blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on&#xD;
      individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal&#xD;
      catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi&#xD;
      and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89&#xD;
      can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve&#xD;
      blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic&#xD;
      equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern&#xD;
      pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen&#xD;
      carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the&#xD;
      injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent&#xD;
      the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by&#xD;
      hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage,&#xD;
      neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good&#xD;
      therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase&#xD;
      the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and&#xD;
      other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation&#xD;
      disorder. At the same time, in the &quot;Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious&#xD;
      Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)&quot; has also&#xD;
      recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of&#xD;
      advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood&#xD;
      circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result,&#xD;
      there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),&#xD;
      with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control. In this&#xD;
      study, an estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients aged 18-85 years old who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), not including critical type in&#xD;
      severity, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89&#xD;
      treatment group and the blank control group, to receive T89 or nothing for up to 14 days on&#xD;
      the base of a standard treatment recommended by the&quot;Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for&#xD;
      Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      As planned, this study will be started before March 2020 in hospitals located in Wuhan of&#xD;
      Hubei province in China and completed at the end of next June 2020.&#xD;
