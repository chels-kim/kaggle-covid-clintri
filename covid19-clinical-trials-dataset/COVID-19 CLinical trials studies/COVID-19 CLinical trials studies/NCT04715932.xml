  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to determine the effects of short-term treatment with&#xD;
      hesperidin on COVID-19 symptoms in comparison with a placebo. Treatment effects will be&#xD;
      observed through a symptoms diary that will be completed by participants throughout the study&#xD;
      and by taking the oral temperature daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study will include&#xD;
      subjects from Quebec diagnosed with COVID-19 infections. Following informed consent, 216&#xD;
      subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      hesperidin 1000 mg once daily (q.d.)) or placebo (1:1 allocation ratio) for 14 days.&#xD;
      Investigational drug will be delivered to the patients' homes with an electronic oral&#xD;
      thermometer and a symptoms diary. Follow-up phone assessments will occur after 3, 7, 10, and&#xD;
      14 days following randomization for evaluation of COVID-19 symptoms. Electronic Case Report&#xD;
      Form (eCRF) will be completed by the research personnel over the phone with the patients. The&#xD;
      symptoms diary will be mailed back to the coordinating center at the end of the study in a&#xD;
      pre-addressed envelope.&#xD;
