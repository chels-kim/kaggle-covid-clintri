      This will be a phase 1a randomized, open label, multi-center study with approximately 24&#xD;
      subjects. All subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) per institutional guidelines for&#xD;
      treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition to SOC, the brequinar&#xD;
      group will receive 5 daily doses of brequinar 100 mg.&#xD;

      This will be a phase 1a randomized, open label, multi-center study with approximately 24&#xD;
      subjects. All subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) per institutional guidelines for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to standard of care&#xD;
      alone or standard of care plus brequinar. The brequinar group will receive 5 daily doses of&#xD;
      brequinar 100 mg on Days 1 - 5. Physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory assessments,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, and other observations will be conducted by experienced personnel&#xD;
      throughout the study based on the Schedule of Events. Blood chemistry tests include blood&#xD;
      urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine amino transferase (ALT),&#xD;
      aspartate amino transferase (AST), bilirubin, total protein, albumin, glucose, serum&#xD;
      electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide/bicarbonate, and calcium), lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (LDH). Plasma will be collected for inflammatory markers such as D-dimer,&#xD;
      ferritin, CRP, and ESR. Pro-inflammatory markers will be measured. Serum is to be collected&#xD;
      for research purposes. Hematology tests include hemoglobin, hematocrit, complete blood count&#xD;
      with full differential, and platelet count. Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral load will be&#xD;
      collected Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 15. Survival will be assessed through Day 29.&#xD;

             intubation and mechanical ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation,&#xD;
             ECMO, or clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure (i.e., clinical need for one of the&#xD;
             preceding therapies, but preceding therapies may not be able to be administered in&#xD;
             setting of resource limitation) ii. Shock (defined by systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm&#xD;
             Hg, or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg or requiring vasopressors) b. Multi-organ&#xD;
