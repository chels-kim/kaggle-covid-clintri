  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the Coronavirus pandemic children's hearing services are closed or reduced and grommet&#xD;
      operations are part of the lowest priority group. In the absence of management options, this&#xD;
      research study aims to see if bone conduction headphones either paired (via bluetooth) to a&#xD;
      microphone or an app will help children with a hearing loss during this period of waiting.&#xD;
      The child's quality of life is measured with validated questionnaires The study is over 3&#xD;
      months, and delivered remotely, with the product being sent to the family home and support&#xD;
      offered via telephone/ video consulattion.&#xD;

      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission of speech aided by a wireless bone-conduction headphone connected to a wireless&#xD;
      Bluetooth microphone during the prolonged waiting time (during the coronavirus pandemic) for&#xD;
      the insertion of grommets, as well as access to the Hear Glue Ear software application is an&#xD;
      acceptable management strategy during the coronavirus period where other forms of treatment&#xD;
      and support are not available or indefinitely delayed. Questionnaires intend to capture data&#xD;
      regarding families perception of child quality of life and developmental outcomes with this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To quantify the differences in speech, language, and quality of life outcome measures&#xD;
      between a group of children aided with a bone-conduction headphone and Hearing Glue Ear app&#xD;
      during the coronavirus pandemic where usual care has been delayed such as waiting for grommet&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A total of 20 children will be enrolled in the study. If drop outs occur, new&#xD;
      participants will be invited to replace those who withdrew from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment Children known to Cambridge Audiology Services and known to have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of glue ear will be invited to take part in the study if they satisfy the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Consent will be obtained from their parents and an age appropriate explanation&#xD;
      given to the child with the chance for the child to sign an age- appropriate assent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The free Hear glue Ear software application will be referred to as 'the app' in this&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single arm design will be used. Participants will have a glue ear (Otitis Media with&#xD;
      Effusion, OME) diagnosis made in the National Health Service Cambridge Audiology clinics.&#xD;
      They will be given information and invited to take part in the study at a time convenient to&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Study will be sent the bone conduction headphones, microphone and details&#xD;
      of how to download the free Hear Glue Ear app. A member of the research team will arrange a&#xD;
      telephone/ video consultation to aid set up and use of the product set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent/ carer will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about their child's listening,&#xD;
      language and quality of life before and after using the product set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone conduction headphones used in this study are currently on the market as a headphones&#xD;
      used by people practising outdoor sports. It is a type of headphones designed for children&#xD;
      and adults to listen to music and speech via bluetooth to a phone or device. It is not a&#xD;
      medical device but has a Conformity marking of Europe (known as CE mark) for being used as a&#xD;
      set of headphones for any member of the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be carried out after 3 months unless the family request more frequent support.&#xD;
      A member of the research team will email or telephone or video- consult (depending on the&#xD;
      preference of the family) after 3 months to see if the family used the Hear Glue Ear&#xD;
      headphones and/ or app at home and gather feedback. Parents will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires again at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's family 'general practitioner' doctor will be informed (with parental consent)&#xD;
      if the child is involved in the research study. The child's inclusion in the research study&#xD;
      should not affect or alter any usual medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will also be possible when the child attends their next NHS hearing test&#xD;
      appointment when services reopen after or during the coronavirus pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of the study and practical aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Invitation to take part&#xD;
&#xD;
           The children and their families will be given a pack containing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parent and child study information sheets. The family and the child will have the&#xD;
                chance to ask initial questions about the study within the remote telephone/ video&#xD;
                clinic appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consent form, which the family can be encouraged to complete and return by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality of life questionnaire for children with Otitis Media known as OMQ14 Speech,&#xD;
           language and listening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Website address: http://hearglueear.wordpress.com (study details including copies of&#xD;
           consent forms and questionnaires will be available on the website) and contact email:&#xD;
&#xD;
           hearglueear@outlook.com (for the families to direct any queries).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Once the child has been recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The children and their family will be sent a bone conduction headphone, microphone&#xD;
                and information on how to download the free Hear Glue Ear app.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant's personal and contact details, as well as a copy of their last&#xD;
                audiology results will be assigned a code that will be used for data collection,&#xD;
                and their personal data and contact details will be kept separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participating families will have a remote telephone/ video appointment offered at&#xD;
                the beginning of the study and 3 months after their involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Three months after their first appointment All the children will be automatically&#xD;
           followed up with another telephone/ video consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family will be encouraged to fill out the final questionnaires, which are the same&#xD;
      validated questionnaires used at the beginning of the study (before the intervention) as well&#xD;
      as a non- validated acceptability questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A website with videos, support information, instructions, and useful materials was created&#xD;
      for use of the participants: http://hearglueear.wordpress.com&#xD;
