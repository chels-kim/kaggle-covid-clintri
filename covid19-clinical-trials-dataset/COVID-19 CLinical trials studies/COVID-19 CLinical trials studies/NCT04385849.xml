    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-point ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status and is performed as the first assessment on each study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 7) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has laboratory-confirmed positive novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) test, as determined&#xD;
             by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or other commercial or public health assay in any&#xD;
             specimen &lt; 72 hours prior to enrollment, or meets the criteria to guide the evaluation&#xD;
             and testing of patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19&#xD;
             (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/HAN00428.asp).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a confirmed NEW score of 0-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has at least one of the following high-risk factors associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
             COVID-19 progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age ≥ 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hypertension currently managed by at least 1 antihypertensive medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Respiratory rate (RR) &lt; 20 breaths per minute (bpm).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Heart rate (HR) &lt; 90 beats per minute (bpm).&#xD;
&#xD;

             lower airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signs or symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory&#xD;
             response syndrome (SIRS)/shock, or cardiac failure; or need for supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], d-dimer,&#xD;
             ferritin, and IL-6) &gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Assessed by the Investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements&#xD;
             of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant and nursing women. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test during screening&#xD;
             prior to the first dose must be documented before N-803 is administered to a female&#xD;
             subject of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
