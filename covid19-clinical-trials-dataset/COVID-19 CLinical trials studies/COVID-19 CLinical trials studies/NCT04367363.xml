  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, we seek to examine the role of popular messaging platform WhatsApp in&#xD;
      information spread during a crisis. As there have been few global crises in the last decade&#xD;
      (coinciding with the rise of social media), the role of private messaging platforms such as&#xD;
      WhatsApp during crisis contexts remains understudied. During the current COVID-19 global&#xD;
      health crisis, we undertook this study to: (1) characterize the nature of WhatsApp use during&#xD;
      crises, (2) characterize the profiles of WhatsApp users (3) understand how WhatsApp usage&#xD;
      links to well-being (fear and thoughts about COVID-19).&#xD;
