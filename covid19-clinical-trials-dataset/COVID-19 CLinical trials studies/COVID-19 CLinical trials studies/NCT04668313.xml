  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anticipated second wave of COVID-19 cases will present healthcare system challenges,&#xD;
      including requirement to monitor large numbers of patients for deteriorating respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Rising respiratory rate can identify deterioration requiring escalation of care.&#xD;
      However constant monitoring of respiratory rate can be challenging outwith critical care&#xD;
      units due to feasibility and inaccuracy of intermittent measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearable biosensors which allows for remote patient monitoring of RR is therefore attractive,&#xD;
      particularly when combined in a dashboard with clinical summary data. This would establish&#xD;
      source data and infrastructure for the training and validation of machine-learning models,&#xD;
      with decision support risk-predictions prioritising alerts and clinician reviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Altair medical has developed a pre-commercial investigational wearable (chest-worn) biosensor&#xD;
      which can measure continuous respiratory rate and respiratory events. This sensor has been&#xD;
      verified to have good correlation with reference impedance plethysmography data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inpatients in the QEUH with respiratory failure from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of capacity to consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiology data will be correlated with event time-course data including oxygen and breathing&#xD;
      support requirements, deterioration, hospital discharge and status at 28 days and 90 days&#xD;
      post discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small subset of patients will have further investigations - parasternal EMG; thoracic&#xD;
      electrical impedance tomography; forced oscillometry and post discharge Altair and Fitbit&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study analysis will include machine learning model development with the objective of&#xD;
      developing risk-predictions for clinically significant deteriorations.&#xD;

        Potential participants with respiratory failure will be identified by the clinical teams in&#xD;
        the emergency departments, admissions units, respiratory wards or high dependency units of&#xD;
        the study sites. Patient information sheets would be provided to potential participants.&#xD;
        Study team will liase with clinical staff to identify potential participants and maintain a&#xD;
        screening and recruitment log. Based on this information, a member of the team delivering&#xD;
        the trial with appropriate knowledge will assess eligibility against inclusion and&#xD;
        exclusion criteria. No additional tests are required to determine eligibility.&#xD;
