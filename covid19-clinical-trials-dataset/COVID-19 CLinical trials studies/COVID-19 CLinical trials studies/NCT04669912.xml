  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lockdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic was an unpreceded model of the impact of&#xD;
      lifestyle on chronic diseases, especially for adolescents and young adults with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D) whose lifestyle is known to strongly impact disease management. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to assess changes in self-monitoring and glycemic control in this&#xD;
      population before, during, and after the two-month French lockdown. Te investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized an improvement in glucose control and glucose sensor usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will include all patients with T1D from 13 to 25 years old using a flash glucose&#xD;
      monitoring related to the LibreView cloud platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, evolution of percentage of glucose time in range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR), and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (glucose management indicator GMI, time spent below range TBR, and sensor&#xD;
      usage) will be analyzed with a linear mixed-effects regression model.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data will be collected from the cloud-based platform,&#xD;
      LibreView.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for patients from Sud-Francilien hospital (Corbeil-Essonnes, France)&#xD;
      and Kremlin-Bicêtre hospital (Kremlin-Bicêtre, France). Data related to glucose control and&#xD;
      sensor usage will be collected from the Libreview platform. Data related to patients'&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment and telemedicine visits (number of contacts with health&#xD;
      professionals) will be collected from the medical record and confirmed with&#xD;
      telephone-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lockdown imposed by the French government occurred from March 17 to May 10, 2020.&#xD;
      Therefore, outcomes will be assessed 4 times: the month before lockdown, during the first&#xD;
      month, the second month of lockdown, and one month after lockdown ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential confounding factors will be studied: age, gender, type of insulin delivery&#xD;
      (multiple daily injections, MDI; insulin pump), contacts with health professionals (physician&#xD;
      or nurse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will include means with standard deviations, numbers of patients and&#xD;
      percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be analysed with a linear mixed-effects regression model. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed with R studio version 3.5.0.&#xD;
