  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invivoscribe, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary LabPMM, LLC are collecting peripheral&#xD;
      blood specimens from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. These donors will&#xD;
      be from a population of patients who are already providing nasal pharyngeal (NP) swab samples&#xD;
      in universal transport media (UTM) for COVID-19 testing at LabPMM LLC. Specimens meeting this&#xD;
      research protocol's inclusion criteria may be evaluated with various molecular techniques in&#xD;
      order to identify nucleic acid sequences, antibodies, and/or antigens with the potential of&#xD;
      being used to develop novel SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and COVID- 19 treatments and/or&#xD;
      prevention methods (e.g. drug or vaccine development).&#xD;
