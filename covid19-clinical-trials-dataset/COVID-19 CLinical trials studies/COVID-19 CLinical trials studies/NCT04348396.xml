  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is an observational, prospective study. Its aim is to deepen our understanding of&#xD;
      COVID-19 in older patients hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, socioeconomic, diagnostic, biological, functional, therapy data will be&#xD;
      collected at the patients' admission, during hospital stay, at the discharge and 1, 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and findings will help support changes in clinical practice and decision making, with&#xD;
      the aim to reduce the use of healthcare services and the healthcare expenditure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current knowledge about clinical and biological characteristics of COVID 19 among older&#xD;
      people is very limited. A better comprehension of the clinical picture of older patients&#xD;
      affected by COVID-19, (e.g. frailty, multimorbidity and polypharmacy patterns and functional&#xD;
      performance) may significantly contribute to deepen our understanding of the clinical&#xD;
      epidemiology knowledge of COVID-19 among hospitalized older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the ReportAge-COVID project aims to collect - using a minimum clinical and&#xD;
      biological data set - a series of data and indicators on the conditions of elderly patients&#xD;
      that are suspected of having a compatible clinical picture or were confirmed positive for&#xD;
      COVID-19. Data will be collected at the patients' admission, during hospital stay, at&#xD;
      discharge and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the following specific pieces of information will be gathered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  routinely collected demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, biological and diagnostic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frailty condition (by using the clinical frailty scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of the functional capacities through ADL and IADL tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  health conditions; nutritional status; medications; treatments and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biomarkers of aging including cytokines and anti-inflammatory molecules, previously&#xD;
           identified in a focus group of experts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and findings will help support changes in clinical practice and decision making, with&#xD;
      the aim of reducing adverse outcomes, the worsening of health conditions in the elderly&#xD;
      population, the use of healthcare services and, as a consequence, lower healthcare&#xD;
      expenditure.&#xD;
