  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research is to assess candidate COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests (e.g.&#xD;
      immunodiagnostic antibody tests, like Cellex qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, or antigen&#xD;
      tests, like Artron Laboratories Inc. rapid COVID-19 antigen test, and LAMP-based molecular&#xD;
      tests) in order to judge their clinical accuracy compared to Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      (CDC)-recommended molecular genetic testing and clinical diagnosis. Second, it is our goal to&#xD;
      determine if self-testing assisted by COVIDscanDX mobile device camera acquisition software&#xD;
      platform and telemedicine clinical/technical support (virtual point-of-care) improves the&#xD;
      ease of use and immediate interpretation of the tests, thus making self-testing comparable in&#xD;
      accuracy and safety to testing in a clinical setting. Third, we are testing antibodies to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 after diagnosis with COVID-19 or following vaccination to measure the onset and&#xD;
      time course of detectable antibodies from finger-stick blood drops and rapid antibody lateral&#xD;
      flow tests. The overall purpose of the study is to dramatically increase the capacity of&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing by establishing the safety, ease-of-use and validity of self-testing&#xD;
      assisted by mobile device imaging and telemedicine remote support and provide evidence of&#xD;
      antibody time-course response to vaccination.&#xD;

      Two Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs will be collected from opposite nares by health care&#xD;
      professionals at the POC from minimally 155 subjects enrolled at a minimum of 2 point-&#xD;
      of-care (POC) clinical sites. One swab will be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      responsible for COVID -19 using antigen-based tests. A second swab will be placed in&#xD;
      transport media and transferred to a laboratory for testing using a high sensitivity EUA&#xD;
      real-time (RT) PCR assay as the comparator method and the Ct values used to determine&#xD;
      positive or negative. The order of sample collection will be randomized. Minimally 35&#xD;
      positive and 120 negative NP specimens are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to 4 health care professional operators per site, with a range of education and training,&#xD;
      at a point of care setting will perform a COVID-19 Rapid test assay utilizing the&#xD;
      Instructions for Use and/or Quick Reference Instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Population: Men and women, age 18 and older, with symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: 1) Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated for comparison of results&#xD;
      between the Rapid test and the high sensitivity EUA real-time (RT) PCR assay comparator. 2)&#xD;
      Evidence that a Health Care Professional (HCP) at Point of Care (POC) can safely and&#xD;
      effectively utilize the Rapid test and the COVIDscanDX reader after reading the Instructions&#xD;
      For Use (IFU) and/or brief instruction video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody testing will be performed after PCR/antigen testing or after vaccination with and&#xD;
      FDA EUA allowed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A finger-stick blood drop, nasopharyngeal swab or saliva&#xD;
      sample in buffer is applied to a lateral flow test to measure either SARS-CoV-2 antigen or&#xD;
      IgM and IgG antibodies either once or up to five times separated by a week for 35 days after&#xD;
      vaccination. Follow-up tests may be performed to measure the longevity of the antibody&#xD;
      response over time up to a year.&#xD;
