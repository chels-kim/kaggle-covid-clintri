  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the safety and feasibility of rhDNase1 and its impact on&#xD;
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 infected patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that elevated numbers of neutrophils (PMNs) in the blood predicts poor&#xD;
      outcomes and severity in patients with COVID-19 infections. Acute inflammation results in&#xD;
      formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by PMNs and NK cells. Pre-clinical studies&#xD;
      showed that NETs are critically involved in the pathophysiology of ARDS and increased&#xD;
      capacity of PMNs to form NETs was shown to correlated with increased severity and mortality&#xD;
      in patients with ARDS after community-acquired pneumonia. In early reports, patients with&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 infections were also found to have radiological and clinical findings of&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). NETs can be degraded by DNase1 for which there is&#xD;
      a human recombinant equivalent rhDNase1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the safety and feasibility of inhaled rhDNase1 in severely ill COVID-19&#xD;
           patients requiring admission;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the impact of rhDNase1 in limiting progression of disease and COVID-19&#xD;
           related complications in these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. and to investigate NETs as possible therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19 patients by&#xD;
           quantifying levels of circulating NETs in the blood and sputum and correlating these&#xD;
           with oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation, radiological progression of ARDS, secondary bacterial infections&#xD;
           (pneumonia, bacteremia and other), renal dysfunction, duration of ICU admission, and&#xD;
           time to discharge or mortality.&#xD;
