  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objective is to explore ambulance service attendance at incidents involving&#xD;
      alcohol and/or substance use over the period of the pandemic lockdown, and the following&#xD;
      months. This will be to determine prevalence and explore factors such as patient gender, age,&#xD;
      ethnicity or location. Analysis will examine the calls over the course of the year prior to&#xD;
      the lockdown, and then compare this to the period of lockdown and following months.&#xD;

      The Primary objective is to explore ambulance service attendance at incidents involving&#xD;
      alcohol and/or substance use over the period of the pandemic lockdown, and the following&#xD;
      months. This will be to determine prevalence and explore factors such as patient gender, age,&#xD;
      ethnicity or location. Analysis will examine the calls over the course of the year prior to&#xD;
      the lockdown, and then compare this to the period of lockdown and following months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A time series analysis will be conducted to examine the calls over the course of the year&#xD;
      prior to the lockdown, and then compare this to the period of lockdown and following months.&#xD;
      This will use the 'Interrupted Time Series' (ITS) approach. To explore this regression models&#xD;
      will be built that examine the causal models for attendance prior to the pandemic and&#xD;
      compared to the lockdown time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariable regression model will be built. Initially a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) will&#xD;
      allow the identification of confounders and exposures relevant to the model. A logistic&#xD;
      regression model will be used to calculate the relative risk of call during lockdown compared&#xD;
      to the data prior to lockdown. The model will be fit using p&lt;0.05 as the definition of&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics, trend analysis and predictive analysis will be conducted on the data&#xD;
      set to determine trends across time, factors that predict patients requiring ambulance&#xD;
      attendance, and factors that predict treatment outcomes. Missing data will be examined for&#xD;
      systematic bias, and where found to be missing at random will be excluded from analysis.&#xD;
      Where not missing at random, sensitivity analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will examine covariates. Age will be defined as single year continuous variable and&#xD;
      examined in categories such as 5-year age groups. Ethnicity will be categorised as groups,&#xD;
      such as black, Asian, other minority and mixed ethnic groups will be explored. Census data&#xD;
      such as the deprivation, rurality, income, employment, disability and education will look at&#xD;
      the decile as defined.&#xD;
