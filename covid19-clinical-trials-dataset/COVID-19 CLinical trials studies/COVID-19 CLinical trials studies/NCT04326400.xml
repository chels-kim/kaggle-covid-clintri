      7. Objectives To apply e-health methods to perform active monitoring and assess determinants&#xD;
      of incident Infection of COVID-19 in a hospital population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Study design Prospective, Single-centre, observational clinical study. 9. Disease or&#xD;
      disorder under study Healthy people in risk of COVID-19 infection. 10. Main variable.&#xD;
      Symptoms related to infection caused by SARS-Cov2. 11. Study population and total number of&#xD;
      patients Men and women in general god health status aged between 18 and 80 years that&#xD;
      currently are employees of Hospital de La Princesa .&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Duration of treatment Each subject will be monitored, since its recruitment, for a period&#xD;
      of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Timetable and expected date of completion The overall duration of the study is estimated&#xD;
