      Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 6 million confirmed infected cases&#xD;
      worldwide and over 397,000 deaths as of June 8th, 2020 according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization. Currently, there is no specific medication for COVID-19, as there are different&#xD;
      protocols of treatments that is not fully tested to prove its effectiveness by randomized&#xD;
      control trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to high infectious potentials of COVID-19, all healthcare facilities are burdened out by&#xD;
      an extra ordinary load which is reflected on the economy of the health sector. In Addition to&#xD;
      public health measures like self-quarantine, isolation and social distancing, coming up with&#xD;
      proved effective treatment for Covid-19 will help markedly in restoration of normal daily&#xD;
      activity of people. In Egypt, public health measures are not much fruitful due to lack of&#xD;
      people awareness to properly perform self-quarantine, economic burden for performing mass&#xD;
      nasal swabs, some other factors such as uncertainty regarding the survival of the virus in&#xD;
      air are subsequently adding much concern to the vast quarantine task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the focus has now been directed toward evaluating and implementing other strategies&#xD;
      like chemoprophylaxis and vaccination. In fact, the development of vaccine will take around&#xD;
      two years as current human trials are being employed. Thus, the hope will be shifted towards&#xD;
      the repurposing of an actually used drug to target the viral replication cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorpromazine is an antagonist of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and has been effectively&#xD;
      and safely employed for over half a century in the treatment of psychiatric disorders (Adams,&#xD;
      Awad, Rathbone, Thornley, &amp; Soares-Weiser, 2014). The USA Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      approved the chlorpromazine as a first-generation antipsychotic. It is classified as a&#xD;
      phenothiazine as its primary use is in the management of mental disorders to control mania&#xD;
      and treatment of schizophrenia and it has several additional approved and off-label uses.&#xD;
      Heart conduction abnormalities related to chlorpromazine use is only related to high doses.&#xD;
      The most commonly reported signs and symptoms of acute toxicity are severe extrapyramidal&#xD;
      reactions, hypotension, and sedation (Beckett, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study Globally COVID-19 has led to large numbers of infection and death.&#xD;
      In Egypt, number of confirmed cases increased above 30,000 according to the Egyptian Ministry&#xD;
      of Health by 8th of June 2020. Furthermore, there is a change of the treatment protocol&#xD;
      according to the severity of signs and symptoms aiming to decrease the load on the health&#xD;
      facilities in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incubation period of COVID-19 is around 5.2 days at which the symptoms appears after (Li&#xD;
      et al., 2020). The period from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranged from 1 week to&#xD;
      6 weeks with a median of 2 weeks (W., J., &amp; F., 2020). This period is varied and can be&#xD;
      determined according to the age and patient's immune system status. Patients &gt; 70-years have&#xD;
      a limited time compared to those under age of 70 (W. et al., 2020). The most symptoms at&#xD;
      onset of COVID-19 illness are cough, fever and fatigue, shortness of breath in addition to&#xD;
      sputum production, headache, dyspnea, diarrhea and lymphopenia (Huang et al., 2020; Ren et&#xD;
      al., 2020; W. et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Clinically, a chest CT scan shows a diagnostic&#xD;
      status of pneumonia, however, it is reflected clinically on patients showing acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and presence of grand-glass opacities&#xD;
      that led to hypoxemia and death (Huang et al., 2020). At the molecular level, COVID-19&#xD;
      integration to the host cells requires active function of lysosome with a pH value from 4.5&#xD;
      to 5. This is the suitable pH for the bio-chemical reactions which leads finally to removal&#xD;
      of the viral protein envelope and freedom of the viral genetic material for replication the&#xD;
      molecular integration (Mindell, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorpromazine has an alkaline effect on lysosomal pH. The significance in repurposing the&#xD;
      chlorpromazine to target COVID-19 replication is due to the fact that an in-vitro dose of&#xD;
      0.82 μM leads to alkalization lysosome which is the lowest dose with no toxicity. The&#xD;
      evidence of lysosomal pH alkalization was confirmed by a special fluorescent dye; LysoTracker&#xD;
      Red1 DND-99 (LTR), which has been reported to accumulate in lysosomes by virtue of ionic&#xD;
      trapping requiring acidic pH. The more LTR the more acidity of pH and vice versa, according&#xD;
      to the study an evaluation was done after treatment of chlorpromazine with a concentration&#xD;
      range from 200 μM to 0.82 μM. It was found that after 30 mins of chlorpromazine invitro&#xD;
      treatment, there was a dose-dependent decrease of LTR staining (Lu, Sung, Lin, Abraham, &amp;&#xD;
      Jessen, 2017) . The lowest effective dose to transfer the invitro dose to in vivo calculated&#xD;
      as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (The desired dose x the molecular weight of the drug x average weight of patient in Kg)/1000&#xD;
&#xD;
      = (0.82 x 355 x 80 kg) / 1000 = 23.288 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the bioavailability of chlorpromazine is around 20-32% (Beckett, 2014; Boyd-Kimball et&#xD;
      al., 2019). Thus, the dose might be required will be 100 mg. Since chlorpromazine is mostly&#xD;
      metabolized by CYP2D6 in the liver, it would most likely exhibit patient dependent variable&#xD;
      dose response. 100 mg dose could affect blood pressure thus cumulative dose will be&#xD;
      considered. Initial start of dose will be 50 mg/ day for three days to be increased to100&#xD;
      mg/day till recovery. The toxicity of Chlorpromazine can occurs with a dose of 3000mg/day&#xD;
      (Beckett, 2014). This is to further safeguard patients, clinical guideline and policy ought&#xD;
      to be developed to provide ethical and legal framework for another use of chlorpromazine with&#xD;
      COVID-19, also to follow the guidelines and institutional policies for using this medication&#xD;
      within the hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, clinicians and Care givers can add chlorpromazine to the protocol of medical&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19 by providing evidence-based and comprehensive recommendation on the&#xD;
      potential benefits, risks and related safety issues. The investigator believed that study&#xD;
      will give the clinician an evidenced based practice to control COVID-19 replication using&#xD;
      chlorpromazine. Although the literature revealed a possible hypotension effect from high&#xD;
      doses of chlorpromazine, there are still risks of slight hypotension occurrence from low dose&#xD;
      due to the nature of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of drugs for treatment of COVID-19 is adding much value to the significance and the&#xD;
      originality of this study. The investigator aims at providing an evidence base for the effect&#xD;
      of chlorpromazine on clinical picture progress of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single centred, single-blinded randomised controlled trial. All subjects from a population of&#xD;
      interest will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, one group who is exposed to the&#xD;
      intervention or a second group who receive the routine care in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings This study will be conducted at New EL Kasr Al Aini hospital isolation wards. New EL&#xD;
      Kasr Al Aini is Cairo University affiliated hospital. The COVID-19 patients are referred for&#xD;
      isolation unit who receive COVID-19 protocol of treatment according to the Egyptian Ministry&#xD;
      of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenient sample of patients with COVID-19 patients will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      groups; study and control group. Data will be collected over a duration of 14 days,&#xD;
      considering that patients will not be less than 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the experimental work (Chlorpromazine administration) The study group will be&#xD;
      chosen to match the inclusion criteria, after that the investigator will obtain a written&#xD;
      consent from patients who are willing to participate in the study. Randomization of subjects&#xD;
      followed by a baseline laboratory , clinical data and illness severity score according to WHO&#xD;
      ordinal scale will be recorded for both groups, then an initial dose of 50 mg of&#xD;
      chlorpromazine hydrochloride orally once daily at night for three days to be doubled to 100mg&#xD;
      / day till recovery criteria are met with maximum of 14 days. Evaluation of laboratory and&#xD;
      clinical findings will start at day 0, 3, 7, 11 and 15 from day of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration Once the protocol is granted from Ethics and Research committee, an&#xD;
      official permission will be taken from hospital administrators. Also; each patient will be&#xD;
      informed about the purpose of the study and its importance. The investigator will confirm&#xD;
      with the patients that sharing in this study is on voluntary bases. They have the right to&#xD;
      withdraw from research without any penalty and this will not affect the provided routine&#xD;
      care. Anonymity and confidentiality are assured through coding the data. The study subjects&#xD;
      will be informed that the data will not be reused in another research without their&#xD;
      permission. Informed consent will be taken from the patients who accept to be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon receiving the formal approval to conduct the study, an official permission will be&#xD;
      obtained from hospital director to proceed with the proposed study. The study participants&#xD;
      will be selected according to the inclusion criteria, then the investigator will obtain a&#xD;
      written consent from participants who are willing to participate in the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned into study and control group. Both groups will receive the routine&#xD;
      regime of medical treatment, During the implementation, baseline clinical, laboratory data&#xD;
      and illness severity score will be recorded for both groups. However, the study group will&#xD;
      receive initially a dosage of 50 mg of chlorpromazine hydrochloride orally once daily at&#xD;
      night for duration of three days. Dose will be doubled to 100 mg/ day till recovery criteria&#xD;
      are met with maximum of 14 days. The dose is calculated according to the bioavailability and&#xD;
      the lowest effective required dose to rich the cells which should be not less than 0.82 uM&#xD;
      (Lu et al., 2017). Finally, both groups will be monitored utilizing the tool sheets, any&#xD;
      complications will be noted and will be reported for both groups. The investigator will&#xD;
      record the values of assessment of patient at which heart rate and peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be assessed by pulse oximetry, respiration will be counted by the&#xD;
      investigator and blood pressure will be assessed by digital or mercury sphygmomanometer.&#xD;
      Recording of laboratory and clinical data will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtained data will be tabulated, computed and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Science (SPSS) program version 21. Descriptive as frequency, mean, standard deviation…etc.,&#xD;
      in addition to inferential statistics as T.test and ANOVA will be utilized to analyze data&#xD;
      pertinent to the study. Level of significance will be at P ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
