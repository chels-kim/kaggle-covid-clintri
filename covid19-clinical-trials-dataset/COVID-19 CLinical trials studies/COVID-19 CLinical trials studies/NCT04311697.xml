  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) is known to cause Respiratory Failure, which is the hallmark&#xD;
      of Acute COVID-19, as defined by the new NIH/FDA classification. Approximately 50% of those&#xD;
      who develop Critical COVID-19 die, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Patients with Critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure, currently treated with high flow&#xD;
      nasal oxygen, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation will be treated with ZYESAMI&#xD;
      (aviptadil), a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus maximal&#xD;
      intensive care vs. placebo + maximal intensive care. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      intravenous Aviptadil will receive escalating doses from 50 -150 pmol/kg/hr over 12 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lung Injury, which triggers Critical COVID-19 is a known lethal complication of Corona&#xD;
      Virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and&#xD;
      respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Human&#xD;
      Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the&#xD;
      treatment of ARDS and admitted to the FDA CoronaVirus Technology Accelerator Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIP binds to VPAC1 receptors on the pulmonary Alveolar Type II (ATII) cell. ATII cells&#xD;
      comprise only 5% of lung epithelial cells but are critical for oxygen transfer, surfactant&#xD;
      production, and maintenance of Alveolar Type 1 cells. 70% of VIP binds to this receptor. The&#xD;
      Type II cell is also the cell selectively attacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the ACE2&#xD;
      surface receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung and specifically&#xD;
      bound to the ATII cell, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung,&#xD;
      inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, and&#xD;
      upregulates surfactant production, These and other effects have been observed in numerous&#xD;
      animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In&#xD;
      these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and&#xD;
      thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aviptadil ihas a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in phase 2 trials for Sarcoid,&#xD;
      Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8&#xD;
      patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP.&#xD;
      Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint.&#xD;
      Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority.&#xD;
      Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well&#xD;
      tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or&#xD;
      ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded&#xD;
      basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores&#xD;
      function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients who are hospitalized for Critical COVID-19 infection with respiratory&#xD;
      failure will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in&#xD;
      addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone. Primary endpoints will&#xD;
      be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.&#xD;
