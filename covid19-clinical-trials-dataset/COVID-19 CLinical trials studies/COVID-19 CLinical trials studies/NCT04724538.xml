  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic of unprecedented proportions with an exponential&#xD;
      increase in incidence. Airway epithelium infection caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      triggers a cascade of difficult-to-control reactions, a so-called &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. In&#xD;
      contrast to the previously used method of external beam radiation therapy for patients at&#xD;
      high risk of a cytokine storm, in present study a different dose delivery mechanism through&#xD;
      inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon ultrafine aerosol obtained from a TechnegasPlus generator&#xD;
      is used. By utilizing anthropometric phantoms the dosimetric characteristics of the applied&#xD;
      technique and obtained the coefficients of the transition from the count rate over the area&#xD;
      of interest to the activity contained in this area (in kBq) were studied. By observing a&#xD;
      group of healthy volunteers after inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon ultrafine aerosol, the&#xD;
      accumulated dose in the human lungs under internal irradiation of 99mTc was determined. A&#xD;
      novel technique has been developed and the possibility of using inhaled low-dose radionuclide&#xD;
      therapy in the complex treatment of patients with COVID-19 - associated pneumonia has been&#xD;
      studied. As a result, a significant improvement of hematological parameters in the group of&#xD;
      patients after inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon ultrafine aerosol as compared to the&#xD;
      control group is expected.&#xD;
