  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In times of crisis, diminishing supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals&#xD;
      has forced both healthcare workers and the general population to reuse and clean PPE using&#xD;
      anecdotal strategies which may weaken its effectiveness of preventing acquisition of airborne&#xD;
      respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19. There is therefore a great need to develop&#xD;
      innovative measures to generate reusable PPE that can be safely cleaned and sterilized. A&#xD;
      novel reusable injection molded respirator will be evaluated using qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative fit tests to assess overall fit and comfort.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PPE is the last line of defense in the hierarchy of controls to prevent the spread of&#xD;
      airborne transmissible infections. There are many varieties of respirators including&#xD;
      quarter-mask, half mask, and full facepiece respirators that filter 95, 99, or 100% of&#xD;
      airborne particles. The elastomeric half mask respirators (EHMRs), in particular, have&#xD;
      several advantages over commonly used N95 FFRs. Firstly, EHMRs may be cleaned, disinfected,&#xD;
      and reused unlike FFRs that are normally discarded after a single use. EHMRs may be&#xD;
      transparent as a result of material choice and will allow for visualization of the mouth.&#xD;
      Lastly, they have been shown to properly fit faces after multiple rounds of decontamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some disadvantages of EHMRs include the requirement to disinfect and reinspect the quality of&#xD;
      components on the respirator by a qualified individual for proper function, as well as manual&#xD;
      exchange of filter components. Notwithstanding, it has been found that fit testing and&#xD;
      training to use EHMRs for healthcare personnel is not significantly different than N95&#xD;
      respirators and that EHMR may serve as a suitable alternative to disposable N95 respirators&#xD;
      during public health emergencies. Furthermore, a 2018 consensus report from the National&#xD;
      Academies of Engineering, Science, and Medicine recommended that the durability and&#xD;
      reusability of elastomeric respirators made them desirable for stockpiling for emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new transparent elastomeric respirator has been developed that can maintain respirator&#xD;
      integrity after decontamination and fits many people with different face sizes and shapes.&#xD;
      Fit testing of the respirator will be performed using an OSHA-approved testing method.&#xD;
