      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic infection called COVID-19. It is a global threat&#xD;
      to people, communities, and health systems. Researchers are concerned about the mental health&#xD;
      effects of the pandemic. They want to learn more about how it is affecting people s alcohol&#xD;
      use and problems, and how it may continue to affect them over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use and consequences in individuals&#xD;
      across the spectrum of alcohol use and those with alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have been screened under the NIAAA Screening, Assessment and Management&#xD;
      Protocol (14-AA-0181)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a baseline survey by phone. It will ask about alcohol use, alcohol&#xD;
      dependence, and stress. It covers 2 time periods: the 12 months before the pandemic started&#xD;
      and the time since it started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get an ID code and a link to an online survey. They will complete the&#xD;
      online survey within a week of the phone survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a series of online surveys over 24 months. For the first year,&#xD;
      surveys will be completed weekly for the first 4 weeks, then biweekly for the next 8 weeks,&#xD;
      and then every 1-2 months for the rest of the year. For the second year, surveys will be&#xD;
      completed every 6 months. Surveys will cover the following topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol use and its consequences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other substance use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the course of the pandemic may change, the frequency of the surveys may change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts 2 years.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak started in 2019 and has resulted in a world-wide&#xD;
      pandemic infection designated COVID-19. This pandemic has become an unprecedented global&#xD;
      threat to individuals, communities and health systems. While immediate attention has&#xD;
      appropriately focused on prevention and treatment of SARS CoV-2 infection, the widespread&#xD;
      societal mental health consequences of the pandemic cannot be ignored. Given the catastrophic&#xD;
      impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to prospectively and longitudinally assess&#xD;
      the impact on alcohol use and problems, along with associated behaviors and outcomes. Thus,&#xD;
      the goal of this study is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use and&#xD;
      consequences in individuals across the spectrum of alcohol use and alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol consumption and consequences&#xD;
           in individuals across the spectrum of alcohol use and those with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the time-course of changes in measures of negative life events, social&#xD;
           isolation and stress, and their effect on alcohol consumption and consequences over a&#xD;
           24-month period during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. (Exploratory aim) To examine the role of anxiety, depression, craving, binge drinking,&#xD;
           impaired control in the relationships examined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to complete several surveys by phone and/or online over 2 years&#xD;
      at intervals that range from weekly to bimonthly in the first year and every 6 months during&#xD;
      the second year. Depending on the trajectory of the pandemic, the frequency of the surveys&#xD;
      may be modified if necessary. The surveys will assess a range of outcomes related to alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and consequences, along with measures of other substance use, stress, sleep,&#xD;
      physical health and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size for this study will consist of 700 participants including,&#xD;
      non-drinkers, light drinkers, non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers, and treatment-seeking&#xD;
      individuals with alcohol use disorder who have been screened under the NIAAA Screening,&#xD;
      Assessment and Management (SAM) Protocol (14-AA-0181). As this is a natural history study,&#xD;
      recruitment will be open to all participants from the NIAAA screening protocol. We will not&#xD;
      select participants based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIAAA Intramural Clinical Research Program located in the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD.&#xD;
      Study will be conducted via telephone and online survey, and participants will not have&#xD;
      in-person study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 60 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: 24 months&#xD;
