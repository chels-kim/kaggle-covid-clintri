  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) do not have a family member with diabetes and often&#xD;
      are not diagnosed until the child is very sick. Research suggests that screening and&#xD;
      identifying children at risk for T1D autoantibodies can prevent serious illness at the time&#xD;
      of diagnosis and improve long-term health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will screen children, ages 0-5.99 for blood markers related to T1D and&#xD;
      celiac disease during routine healthcare delivery at birth, 1, 2 and 5, years of age.&#xD;
      Children found to have these markers will be either be referred to clinical care or offered&#xD;
      participation in other monitoring or prevention trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In partnership with Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Sanford PLEDGE Study is a large-scale,&#xD;
      observational, feasibility study of general population screening for T1D and celiac&#xD;
      autoantibodies. Screening is incorporated into routine health care visits within an&#xD;
      integrated health system.&#xD;
