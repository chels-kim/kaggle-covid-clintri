  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID&#xD;
      19), which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a major concern all over the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the&#xD;
      survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite any&#xD;
      attempted treatment.. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower&#xD;
      mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with&#xD;
      convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered&#xD;
      from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over&#xD;
      the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied.&#xD;
      Plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid. Albumin is&#xD;
      better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges using albumin solutions increase the risk&#xD;
      of bleeding because of progressive coagulation factor depletion. With either albumin or fresh&#xD;
      frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in the plasma donor and in&#xD;
      the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient with COVID 19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be overcome by using selective apheresis&#xD;
      methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP).DFPP is a modality of plasma&#xD;
      purification that performs an initial plasma separation from blood, and the subsequent&#xD;
      separation of specific molecules, on the basis of their specific molecular weight (cut-off),&#xD;
      by using a fractionation filter. The Fractionation Filter 2A20, because of its membrane&#xD;
      sieving cut-off, retains larger molecules and returns plasma along with smaller molecules to&#xD;
      the circulation, including the major part of the albumin. The selection of the membrane 2A20&#xD;
      is related to the appropriate Sieving Coefficient for IgG that allows to efficiently collect&#xD;
      antibodies from patients which are recovered from COVID-19, with negligible fluid losses and&#xD;
      limited removal of albumin. The total amount of antibodies obtained during one DFPP session&#xD;
      exceeds by three to four times the total amount provided to recipients with one unit of&#xD;
      plasma obtained during one plasma-exchange session from one COVID-19 convalescent donor. This&#xD;
      should result in more effective viral inhibition and larger benefit for the patient achieved&#xD;
      with one unit of enriched immunoglobulin solution obtained with DFPP than with one unit of&#xD;
      plasma obtained with plasma exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations provide the background for a pilot study aimed to explore whether the&#xD;
      infusion of antibodies obtained with one single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent&#xD;
      donors could offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for critically ill patients with&#xD;
      severe coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
