  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the present clinical trial is that an orally available drug given to&#xD;
      outpatients that could reduce the viral burden in the upper respiratory tract could forestall&#xD;
      complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce transmission from one infected individual to&#xD;
      another.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor shown to inhibit SARS-COV-2&#xD;
      replication in vitro, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in early stage, laboratory-confirmed,&#xD;
      COVID-19 ambulatory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor used primarily for treating postoperative&#xD;
      reflux esophagitis and for acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis. This drug, with more&#xD;
      than 15 years clinical experience in Japan with a very safe clinical track record, will be&#xD;
      studied as a repurposed drug based on published in vitro virus inhibition data and in vivo&#xD;
      protective effects in a mouse model of SARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether camostat mesylate reduces&#xD;
      SARS-COV-2 viral load in early COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

    <description>Change of COVID-19 symptom severity from day 0 to day 6 will be assessed with the COVID-19 daily self score tool. Adapted from the FLU-PRO instrument, it consists of 39 items that are answered daily. Items 1-33 are Likert scale questions (rated 0-4) where 0 = not at all and 4 = very much. These items are summed to score the severity of symptoms- where a total score of 132 would indicate the greatest severity of symptoms and a score of 0 would indicate no severity of symptoms. Items 34-38 are also Likert scale questions (rated 0-4) that measure the frequency of specific daily symptoms where 0 = 0 times and 4 = 4 times or more. These items are summed to score the frequency of symptoms- where the highest score for the frequency of symptoms (20) indicates the greatest burden of symptom frequency. The last question (39) asks patients for their highest temperature in Fahrenheit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be enrolled within 3 days of being notified of their first positive COVID-19 test&#xD;
             result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a recent active COVID-19 infection, as evidenced by the positive test&#xD;
             results being associated with at least one COVID-19-compatible symptom such as fever,&#xD;
             upper respiratory symptoms, cough, chills, loss of taste/smell, etc.(see COVID-19-PRO&#xD;
             symptom score sheet), or a recent high-risk exposure to COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provision of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with COVID-19 within past 3 days and not exhibiting manifestations requiring&#xD;
             hospitalization such as extreme shortness of breath or severe prostration. Nurses at&#xD;
             the study site will assess such severe conditions requiring hospitalization, which&#xD;
             would preclude enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the camostat mesylate&#xD;
             regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at&#xD;
             least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study&#xD;
             participation and for an additional 4 weeks after the end of the camostat mesylate&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure&#xD;
             effective contraception with partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations (see section 5.3) throughout study&#xD;
             duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English and Spanish speaking subjects as well as patients speaking any language for&#xD;
             which we can find appropriate translators will be enrolled. A short form with&#xD;
             interpretation will be used for anyone speaking a language for which a translated&#xD;
             informed consent form is not currently available in accordance with local site IRB&#xD;
             policies, including developing certified translations as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of COVID-19 disease manifestations that would require referral for&#xD;
             consideration of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A previous positive COVID-19 test reported more than 7 days before, which would&#xD;
             indicate likelihood of non-culturable, nonreplicating virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive COVID-19 test without a known recent exposure that would indicate an active&#xD;
             infection, hence an unknown chance of non-culturable, non-replicating virus being&#xD;
             present (i.e., asymptomatic COVID-19 infection of unknown duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergic reactions to components of camostat mesylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With regard to inclusion or exclusion of women of child-bearing potential, women who&#xD;
             report that they know they are pregnant are excluded. All women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential who test positive for pregnancy by urine test at first visit are excluded. A&#xD;
             day 14 followup blood pregnancy test will be done on appropriate enrolled women (i.e.&#xD;
             those who had a negative urine pregnancy test on day 0 for further safety assessment&#xD;
             ).&#xD;
