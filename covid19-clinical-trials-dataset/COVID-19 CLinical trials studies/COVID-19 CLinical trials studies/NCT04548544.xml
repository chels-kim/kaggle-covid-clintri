  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly affecting people's lives around the globe.&#xD;
      Social distancing, self-quarantine, shelter-in-place measures, economic challenges, and&#xD;
      COVID-19-cased illness and deaths have the potential to significantly impact mental health&#xD;
      and cause stress, anxiety, and depression. Adolescents may be especially vulnerable to this&#xD;
      situation, due to their increased vulnerability to the onset of depression and anxiety in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising approach to reduce anxiety and depression in youth is a neuroscience-based&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention Training for Awareness Resilience and Action (TARA) (Henje Blom et&#xD;
      al., 2014). TARA is usually delivered over 12 weeks by two facilitators in groups of 10-15&#xD;
      adolescents in-person, and it has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in&#xD;
      depressed adolescents (Henje Blom et al., 2016) and modify brain properties (Yuan et al.,&#xD;
      2020). The TARA intervention can also be delivered remotely. Other types of therapy delivered&#xD;
      remotely, such as internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, have shown comparable&#xD;
      efficiency to face-to-face delivery (Carlbring et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to utilize an individually randomized group treatment,&#xD;
      open-label, waitlist-controlled clinical trial to test the feasibility of TARA (delivered&#xD;
      partially over Zoom) in improving the self-reported emotional well-being primary outcome&#xD;
      (emotional problems measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]) in&#xD;
      healthy adolescents between the ages of 14 to 18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that emotional well-being of adolescents in the intervention group&#xD;
      will improve stronger (or deteriorate less) than in the control group. We will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis in 21 adolescents randomized to the TARA intervention (partially delivered over&#xD;
      Zoom) (12 adolescents) or to the waitlist control group (9 adolescents).&#xD;
