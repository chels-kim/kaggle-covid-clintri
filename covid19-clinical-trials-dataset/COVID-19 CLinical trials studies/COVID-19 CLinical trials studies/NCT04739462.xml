  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's purpose is to demonstrate the ability of an mHealth platform as a feasible way of&#xD;
      sharing information in a time of restricted movement in order to inform future studies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether an mHealth platform increases&#xD;
      maternal health knowledge in the areas of birth preparedness, pregnancy, and birth&#xD;
      complications as measured by the pre- and post-surveys in comparison to routine antenatal&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this trial are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment, in a&#xD;
           time of social distancing and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To improve access and linkages to maternal health services and information as well as&#xD;
           provide appropriate referrals for pregnant females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inform the adoption of mHealth into future health delivery plans.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pre- to Post-Intervention Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the percent of pregnant participants who recognize key danger signs during pregnancy, labor and childbirth, and postpartum period. Knowledge is measured pre-intervention (approximately 24-26 weeks gestation) and post-intervention (approximately 2 weeks following delivery). The timeframe is calculated to be 16-18 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knowledge on COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the percent of pregnant participants who identify key symptoms, modes of transmission, and measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). Knowledge is measured pre-intervention (approximately 24-26 weeks gestation) and post-intervention (approximately 2 weeks following delivery). The timeframe is calculated to be 16-18 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pregnancy Risk Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the percent of pregnant participants who believe pregnant females are at increased risk for COVID-19. Knowledge is measured pre-intervention (approximately 24-26 weeks gestation) and post-intervention (approximately 2 weeks following delivery). The timeframe is calculated to be 16-18 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Breastfeeding Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is reported as the percent of pregnant participants who believe it is safe to breastfeed their newborn if they have or have had COVID-19. Knowledge is measured pre-intervention (approximately 24-26 weeks gestation) and post-intervention (approximately 2 weeks following delivery). The timeframe is calculated to be 16-18 weeks.</description>

    <description>All participants randomized to the intervention group will receive 2-4 informational texts each week and will also receive interactive health screening questions throughout enrollment. A participant will also receive appointment reminder texts. All SMS text messages will be transmitted through a local organization known as The Medical Concierge Group (TMCG) via an electronic system that allows for bulk messaging. TMCG also staffs a 24-hour call line for those using TMCG services to call in for medical related questions. This call line is staffed by doctors and nurses; SMS Maama participants randomized to the interventional group will be able to access this call line free of charge as part of their enrollment in SMS Maama.</description>
