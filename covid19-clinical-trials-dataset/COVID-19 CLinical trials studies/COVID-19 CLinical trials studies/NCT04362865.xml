    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who get infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die. This&#xD;
      makes it hard to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be treated at a hospital.&#xD;
      Researchers think the risk may be related to how a person s B and T cells respond to the&#xD;
      virus. B and T cells are the major components of a person s immune response. B and T cells&#xD;
      responding to the virus with a favorable pattern may lead to recovery, and this favorable&#xD;
      pattern may be helpful to establish. If people in a vaccine trial get this same favorable&#xD;
      pattern when responding to a vaccine, this may be a useful early signal that the vaccine will&#xD;
      be successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine how immune cells respond to COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection or had COVID-19&#xD;
      in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, healthy donors with no suspected COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested with a research assay to determine who was infected with COVID-19&#xD;
      and who was not. This test will be used to understand research results, not to advise&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with active infection must be isolated, usually in a hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other participants may give blood samples at NIH or at their local doctor s office or lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood samples up to three times a week for a total of ten times, and&#xD;
      may also give blood samples after starting a vaccine trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone or email every 2 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die, making it&#xD;
           difficult to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be monitored for&#xD;
           respiratory failure as an inpatient. This risk may be related in part to the patient s&#xD;
           immune response which can be characterized with respect to the B- and T-cell repertoire.&#xD;
           Determining patterns of immune response which correlate with clinically effective&#xD;
           immunity may help in determining risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving a vaccine for COVID-19 are tested for antibody production, but&#xD;
           ultimately protection from infection and survival are the most important endpoints,&#xD;
           which will take time. If patients can be checked for a pre-defined favorable pattern of&#xD;
           immune response, it may significantly speed selection of effective candidate vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with hairy cell leukemia&#xD;
           (HCL) who we have extensive experience treating, we do not know if we should be steering&#xD;
           away more from treatments which harm B-cell immunity, like rituximab or obinutuzumab, or&#xD;
           steering away more from treatments which harm T-cell immunity, like purine analogs.&#xD;
           Characterizing the immune response in COVID-19 patients will quickly answer this&#xD;
           question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To characterize immune response in patients with current or prior COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, or normal donors (i.e., those&#xD;
           individuals without COVID-19)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected for research to characterize immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In individuals with suspected or known current or prior COVID-19, samples will be&#xD;
           obtained up to every three days but no more than 10 times overall during the acute phase&#xD;
           of infection. After recovery, samples will be collected up to ten times overall. In&#xD;
           individuals without COVID-19 at the time of enrollment (i.e., &quot;normal&quot; donors), samples&#xD;
           will be collected at least once; in the case of future COVID-19 infection, samples may&#xD;
           be collected at the same times during/post-infection as an individual with COVID-19 at&#xD;
           enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years. An additional blood sample may&#xD;
           be collected in all subjects at one additional time after the receipt of future&#xD;
           COVID-19- related vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol does not involve treatment. The accrual ceiling is set at 180 subjects.&#xD;
