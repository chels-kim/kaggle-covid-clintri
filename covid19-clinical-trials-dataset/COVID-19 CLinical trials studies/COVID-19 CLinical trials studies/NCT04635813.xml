    <textblock>
      Italy has been on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the need to focus resources to deal with the pandemic led to a disruption of&#xD;
      routine surgical care, as well as activity for oncologic and chronic disease. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activity of the Italian&#xD;
      Units of Endocrine Surgery belonging to the SIUEC (Italian Society of Endocrine Surgery), the&#xD;
      most important national scientific society of endocrine surgery.The aim of this study was to&#xD;
