      Phase IV study to evaluate the effectiveness of additional inhaled sargramostim (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      versus standard of care on blood oxygenation in patients with COVID-19 coronavirus infection&#xD;
      and acute hypoxic respiratory failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukine® is a yeast-derived recombinant humanized granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating&#xD;
      factor (rhuGM-CSF, sargramostim) and the only FDA approved GM-CSF. GMCSF, a pleiotropic&#xD;
      cytokine, is an important leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis,&#xD;
      effecting the growth and maturation of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional&#xD;
      activities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell mediated immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukine inhalation or intravenous administration, as an adjuvant therapy, may confer benefit&#xD;
      to patients with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to COVID-19 exposure, who are&#xD;
      at significant risk of mortality. While there is no active IND (Investigational New Drug) for&#xD;
      Leukine in the proposed patient population, Leukine is being studied in Fase II as an&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy in the management of life-threatening infections to boost the hosts innate&#xD;
      immune response to fight infection, reduce the risk of secondary infection, and in varied&#xD;
      conditions as prevention of infection during critical illness. Inhaled Leukine has also been&#xD;
      successfully used as primary therapy to improve oxygenation in patients with disordered gas&#xD;
      exchange in the lungs. We propose that based on preclinical and clinical data, Leukine&#xD;
      inhalation, as an adjuvant therapy, has an acceptable benefit-risk for use in patients with&#xD;
      hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed COVID19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (saturation below 93% on minimal&#xD;
      2 l/min O2) will be randomized to receive sargramostim 125mcg twice daily for 5 days as a&#xD;
      nebulized inhalation on top of standard of care, or to receive standard of care treatment.&#xD;
      Upon progression of disease requiring initiation of mechanical ventilatory support within the&#xD;
      5 day period, in patients in the active group, inhaled sargramostim will be replaced by&#xD;
      intravenous sargramostim 125mcg/m2 body surface area until the 5 day period is reached. From&#xD;
      day 6 onwards, progressive patients in the active group will have the option to receive an&#xD;
      additional 5 days of IV sargramostim, based on the treating physician's assessment. In the&#xD;
      control group progressive desease requiring mechanical ventilatory support, from day 6&#xD;
      onwards, the treating physician will have the option to initiate IV sargramostim 125mcg/m2&#xD;
      body surface area for 5 days. Safety data, including blood leukocyte counts, will be&#xD;
      collected in all patients. Efficacy data will also be collected and will include arterial&#xD;
      blood gases, oxygenation parameters, need for ventilation, lung compliance, organ function,&#xD;
      radiographic changes, ferritin levels, etc. as well as occurrence of secondary bacterial&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (≤2weeks prior to Randomization) confident diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by&#xD;
             antigen detection and/or PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), and/or seroconversion or any&#xD;
             other emerging and validated diagnostic test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In some patients, it may be impossible to get a confident laboratory confirmation of&#xD;
             COVID-19 diagnosis after 24h of hospital admission because viral load is low and/or&#xD;
             problems with diagnostic sensitivity. In those cases, in absence of an alternative&#xD;
             diagnosis, and with highly suspect bilateral ground glass opacities on recent (&lt;24h)&#xD;
             chest-CT scan (confirmed by a radiologist and pulmonary physician as probable&#xD;
             COVID-19), a patient can be enrolled as probable COVID-19 infected. In all cases, this&#xD;
             needs confirmation by later seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of acute hypoxic respiratory failure defined as (either or both)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  saturation below 93% on minimal 2 l/min O2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PaO2/FiO2 below 300&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted to specialized COVID-19 ward&#xD;

             human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor such as sargramostim,&#xD;
             yeast-derived products, or any component of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  mechanical ventilation before start of study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with peripheral white blood cell count above 25.000 per microliter and/or&#xD;
             active myeloid malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients on high dose systemic steroids (&gt; 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients on lithium carbonate therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled in another investigational drug study&#xD;
