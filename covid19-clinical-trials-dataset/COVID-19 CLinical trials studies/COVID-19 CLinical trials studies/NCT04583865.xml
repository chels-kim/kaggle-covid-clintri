  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teleconsultation (TLC) being a new method of anesthesia consultation, deployed as an&#xD;
      emergency in healthcare facilities in the Covid context, it has never been evaluated either&#xD;
      in terms of feasibility or in terms of quality. An initial assessment will highlight the&#xD;
      pitfalls and difficulties encountered and suggest areas for improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of teleconsultation in pediatric anesthesia, a new consultation method&#xD;
      developed in the context of COVID for several weeks, appears necessary and will be a first&#xD;
      inventory after its implementation in France. Analysis of the data collected in this study&#xD;
      will allow us to propose technical, medical and organizational solutions to optimize the&#xD;
      positioning and practical use of TLC for patients and care facilities. This assessment step&#xD;
      seems imperative if the Covid context persists over time but could also be useful for the&#xD;
      development of TLC outside the Covid context.&#xD;

    <description>The feasibility of anesthesia TLC will be assessed by the failure rate of anesthesia TLC, defined by the conversion rate to degraded TLC (use of an unsecured video medium such as WhatsApp or simple audio communication without video support) or in face-to-face consultation</description>
