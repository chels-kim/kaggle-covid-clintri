  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative body image is an important public health concern for young people due to its&#xD;
      prevalence and detrimental impact on young people's health, education, and social life.&#xD;
      Encouragingly, a number of interventions have been designed to improve adolescent body image&#xD;
      in school settings, with promising results. However, the vast majority of studies testing&#xD;
      these interventions are conducted in high-income, English speaking countries, despite&#xD;
      increasingly recognition that negative body image is a global concern. As such, it is&#xD;
      important to develop and disseminate interventions to foster positive body image among&#xD;
      adolescents in low-to-middle income countries, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research indicates high prevalence rates of negative body image among adolescents in many&#xD;
      Asian countries. Indonesia - the focus of the present research - is an emerging middle-income&#xD;
      country in South East Asia. A recent U-Report Poll (UNICEF, 2020) found almost 80% of the&#xD;
      young people surveyed wanted to change something about their appearance, suggesting a degree&#xD;
      of body dissatisfaction and approximately 50% stopped themselves from doing something that&#xD;
      was important to them because of appearance concerns. Moreover, according to the same poll,&#xD;
      over 90% of Indonesian adolescents surveyed reported to wanting to learn ways to improve&#xD;
      their body image in school or online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no body image interventions have been adapted and trialled in Indonesia. Therefore,&#xD;
      this project aims to evaluate the effectiveness as well as the acceptability and feasibility&#xD;
      of a specially adapted version of Dove Confident Me Single Session among Indonesian&#xD;
      adolescents that will be integrated into UNICEF's Life Skills Education curriculum. Notably,&#xD;
      the session has been designed to be feasible to deliver in low-resource schools (e.g., that&#xD;
      do not access to the internet or facilities to show videos or PowerPoint slides).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of the intervention, the study&#xD;
      will compare the body image and well-being of students who take part in the programme to&#xD;
      students who do not take part in any programme (classes as usual). Investigators will also&#xD;
      gather in-depth feedback from students, and teachers via focus groups and surveys, in order&#xD;
      to inform future improvement of the programme for wider implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To undertake this project, the investigators will recruit students and teachers from&#xD;
      approximately 10-15 state junior secondary schools in Indonesia via a local research agency.&#xD;
      Students will complete questionnaire assessments of body image and well-being before and&#xD;
      after programme period, and again 8 weeks later to assess longer-term benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID response: In light of the pandemic and schools predominantly providing online&#xD;
      instruction rather than face-to-face learning, the study will take place online.&#xD;

      Detailed COVID Response Description.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the intervention was specifically designed to be delivered in person and avoided the&#xD;
      use of technology to make it accessible to as many Indonesian adolescents as possible,&#xD;
      circumstances with COVID-19 have meant that the trial will need to conducted online to&#xD;
      minimise undue harm and the spread of infection. From March-present (December) 2020, the vast&#xD;
      majority of schools have stopped in person teaching and are providing education to young&#xD;
      people remotely. The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture has provided schools and&#xD;
      students with data packages to facilitate online learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid delays with the commencement of this trial, we will be executing this trial online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teacher training will include self-directed learning via UNICEF's teacher training e-module&#xD;
      for Life Skills Curriculum which includes the intervention of focus on body image in addition&#xD;
      to a 2 hour zoom workshop with a member of the research team. Schools will be recruited via&#xD;
      email correspondence. Parents will provide informed consent to the school via email or&#xD;
      WhatsApp in line with how they are currently communicating with their child's school and&#xD;
      teacher. Students will provide informed consent and complete surveys across three time points&#xD;
      via Qualtrics on personal devices at home. The acceptability focus groups with teachers and&#xD;
      students from the intervention condition will take place via a video conferencing platform&#xD;
      such as Zoom. The intervention will be delivered online via video conferencing platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure this method of the trial is feasible, we need to ensure students have access to a&#xD;
      device (laptop or iPad), have a stable internet connection and are familiar with video&#xD;
      conferencing platforms for learning. To meet these demands, we will recruit in higher SES&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, given that this method is different from the original plan for this trial (i.e., for&#xD;
      every aspect to be conducted in person), we will be running an internal acceptability pilot.&#xD;
      That is, we will test the feasibility and acceptability of key study elements - i.e.,&#xD;
      delivering the pre and post surveys and the intervention online with two classes prior to&#xD;
      deciding to go ahead with the full trial online. If the data quality is poor and the&#xD;
      engagement in the lesson is low, we will suspend the trial until schools resume face to face&#xD;
      learning and the COVID risk is much lower (e.g., when there is widespread uptake of the&#xD;
      vaccine).&#xD;

    <description>Dove Confident Me Indonesia Single Session is an adaptation of Dove Confident Me Global Single Session, designed to be facilitated by schoolteachers or school counsellors. Dove Confident Me Indonesia includes four interactive activities (to be delivered in a single 90-minute session) as well as a homework challenge and commitment pledge. The programme incorporates three primary techniques to improve Indonesian adolescents' body confidence and self-esteem: (1) psychoeducation, (2) media literacy, and (3) cognitive dissonance as well as two secondary techniques: (4) self-affirmation and (5) cognitive reframing. As the curriculum was adapted to be delivered in Indonesian schools with limited resources, videos or PowerPoint presentations are not included. Instead, a detailed teacher guide and student worksheets are provided.&#xD;
Due to COVID-19, the intervention will be delivered online via video conferencing platform.</description>
