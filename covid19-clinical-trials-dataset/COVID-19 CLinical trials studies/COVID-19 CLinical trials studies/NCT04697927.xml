  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information that will help the reasearchers learn&#xD;
      more about COVID-19 infections in cancer patients, and to find out about the effects of these&#xD;
      infections on cancer treatment and outcomes. The research study involves asking people to&#xD;
      complete a series of online questionnaires that include questions about their medical&#xD;
      history, lifestyle, and risk factors related to the COVID-19 infection. The study will enroll&#xD;
      both MSK patients and their household family members.&#xD;

    <description>The epidemiologic questionnaires used in this study are a composite of validated questions from multiple sources. Many of the questions are an expansion of the MSK General Medical Health clinical questionnaire. Validated questions capturing demographics, employment, lifestyle risk factors, family history, as well as, specific research domains including psychosocial, food security, and financial toxicity have already been utilized in other MSK minimal risk studies. The COVID-19 symptom and history tracker questions were largely drawn from the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium study.</description>
