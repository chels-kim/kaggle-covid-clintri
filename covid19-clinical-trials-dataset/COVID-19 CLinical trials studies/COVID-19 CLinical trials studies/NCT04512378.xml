  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a debilitating condition involving excessive and&#xD;
      uncontrollable worry and anxiety. Difficulty tolerating the uncertainties of life, known as&#xD;
      intolerance of uncertainty (IU), has been shown to be key in the development and maintenance&#xD;
      of GAD symptoms. A new, streamlined cognitive-behavioural treatment that targets IU has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in at reducing GAD symptoms, IU, and general psychopathology when&#xD;
      delivered one-on-one with a therapist, as shown in a recently published pilot study. The&#xD;
      individual format of this treatment is now being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT). The overall objective of this study is to pilot test a group version of the treatment&#xD;
      protocol to determine if a future RCT of this group treatment is both warranted and feasible.&#xD;
      We will also conduct a preliminary investigation into the group treatment's efficacy. A total&#xD;
      of two pilot groups (N = 12-20) will be conducted via two clinical hospital sites in&#xD;
      Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The group treatment protocol will be delivered over the course of&#xD;
      12 weekly therapy sessions. Participants will complete assessment measures at pretreatment,&#xD;
      posttreatment, and at a 6-month follow-up point. All assessments and treatment sessions will&#xD;
      be conducted virtually via videoconferencing platform due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
