    <textblock>
      A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally&#xD;
      named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) emerged at December 2019 in&#xD;
      Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This infectious disease soon caused a large global outbreak and&#xD;
      became a major public health issue. As of 19:00, 12 March 2020, the total number of confirmed&#xD;
      cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China has reached 80982 with 3173 death, and 110 other countries have&#xD;
      officially reported 45164 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with 1520 death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this particular time, only patients with SARS-CoV-2 or other diseases with an emergency&#xD;
      condition were receipted by most of the hospitals in Hubei Province, even in many other&#xD;
      regions of China. The delayed treatment for many chronic diseases, such as malignant tumors,&#xD;
      is an increasing serious problem. One major concern was that patients with malignant tumors&#xD;
      were generally older in age with low immunity. Preliminary study has shown that cancer&#xD;
      patients are most susceptible to infect SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to develop a severe&#xD;
      pneumonia. But many other researches suspected that conclusion. Moreover, many of the&#xD;
      patients with malignant tumors are facing short term death from tumors rather than the risk&#xD;
      of infection. Nevertheless, there is not sufficient evidence to insure the safety of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in high-risk region of COVID-19, and there is also not sufficient information to&#xD;
      judge which patients' tumor therapy can be appropriately delayed. Here the investigators&#xD;
      investigate the safety of chemotherapy for patients with gynecological malignancy in Wuhan,&#xD;
      the center of high-risk regions of COVID-19.&#xD;
