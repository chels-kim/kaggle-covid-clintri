  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France has been put on a lockdown for 8 weeks to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus&#xD;
      between 17/03/2020 and 11/05/2020. During this lockdown, which is likely to have&#xD;
      psychopathological repercussions on the population, the public authorities and the media&#xD;
      informed the population about the number of deaths occurring each day. While the functioning&#xD;
      of autobiographical memory following traumatic events remains a debate in the literature, the&#xD;
      impact of the daily announcement of mass deaths on the memory system in the general&#xD;
      population and the relationship between long-term memory and delusional thinking in certain&#xD;
      psychopathologies have yet to be explored in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to demonstrate that self-reported recall of recorded deaths may&#xD;
      represent this distortion of perception, symptomatic of these pathologies by an on-line&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indeed, it has been reported that under continued stress, delusions and psychotic experiences&#xD;
      can occur in the general population. This phenomenon is found in individuals suffering from&#xD;
      depression and anxiety and schizotypal personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to demonstrate that self-reported recall of recorded deaths may&#xD;
      represent this distortion of perception, symptomatic of these pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, using an online longitudinal questionnaire, the investigators wish to explore :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how the memory system is impacted by mass deaths over several trimesters in the general&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether the long-term memory of people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders&#xD;
           and people suffering from schizotypal personality disorder contains recollection of a&#xD;
           distorted pattern in relation to the actual number of deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goals of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine, in the context of mass deaths, the level and proportion of real or conceived&#xD;
      recall of the number of deaths in the general population based on cognitive and affective&#xD;
      empathy profiles over four trimesters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the investigators want to determine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the proportion of real or conceived recall numbers of deaths by COVID-19 among people&#xD;
           suffering from depression and anxiety in a context of mass death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the proportion of real or conceived recall number of deaths by COVID-19 among people&#xD;
           with schizotypal personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the dynamics of this real or conceived recall for four trimester following the end of&#xD;
           lockdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study will be conducted online. Participants will provide their informed consent.&#xD;
      At these assessment, they will provide a set of self report measures associated to COVID-19&#xD;
      related psychological aspects especially for depression, anxiety and schizotypal personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can only participate once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no minimum/maximum sample size for this study. The study will remain open for 1&#xD;
      year. The sample size should reach 1000 participants at least.&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of self-report measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID-Related Thoughts and Behavioral Symptoms (COV-TaBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Raine Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, (SPQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paranoia Scale&#xD;
