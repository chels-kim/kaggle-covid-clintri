  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO has listed &quot;vaccine hesitancy&quot; as one of the top threats to global health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered the need to vaccinate worldwide as soon as a safe and&#xD;
      efficacious vaccine becomes available. However preliminary data show that, on average, only&#xD;
      50% to 66% of US adults would be willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination when it becomes&#xD;
      available, a percentage lower than what is required for herd immunity to control the&#xD;
      pandemic. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to vaccinate children to reopen schools and&#xD;
      keeping them safe, as well as to immunize pregnant women through vaccination programs since&#xD;
      they constitute a vulnerable population. Vaccine confidence among pregnant women and mothers&#xD;
      of school-aged children during the period of COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, leading to an&#xD;
      important gap of knowledge that may hinder the upcoming global COVID-19 vaccination scale-up&#xD;
      effort. It is therefore of critical importance to assess the level of vaccine confidence and&#xD;
      influencers among pregnant women and mothers of school-aged children during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international nature of the proposed survey will allow the evaluation of vaccine&#xD;
      confidence and its influencers among pregnant women and mothers of school-aged children on a&#xD;
      global level. Therefore, social and geographic characteristics from different countries and&#xD;
      cultures will be available for comparison. The resulting knowledge will be relevant to a&#xD;
      large percentage of the world's population. Any country in the world can participate.&#xD;
