      Considering that simvastatin, and probably statins in general, interfere with SARS-cov-2&#xD;
      cellular uptake and some inflammatory pathways activated by the virus, those patients on&#xD;
      statin therapy should be less vulnerable to infection and their clinical course and prognosis&#xD;
      should be better than that in individuals not on statin therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Statins reduce intracellular cholesterol synthesis by interfering with the limiting enzyme&#xD;
      HMGCoA reductase. A lower intracellular cholesterol concentration leads to activation of the&#xD;
      transcription factor SREBP 2 upregulating LDL receptor synthesis. In general, intracellular&#xD;
      cholesterol homeostasis achieves a new physiological equilibrium at lower cholesterol&#xD;
      concentrations. Moreover, the effect of cholesterol pathway inhibition has also an effect on&#xD;
      farnesyl and geranyl molecules formation influencing protein prenylation leading to changes&#xD;
      on inflammation and immunomodulation in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in intracellular cholesterol alter cell membrane composition, particularly the&#xD;
      structures referred to cholesterol rafts that accommodate a huge number of cell surface&#xD;
      proteins as receptors. Theoretically, alterations in cholesterol rafts could derange the&#xD;
      function of some receptors Some preliminary studies on cell models have suggested that&#xD;
      statins could interfere the activity of some membrane viral receptors blunting its entry to&#xD;
      cell (Berraondo P et al CIMA nonpublished data). SARS-cov-2 goes into cells through the&#xD;
      Angiotensin Converser Enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is located in the surface of several cells&#xD;
      including lung cells. It has been suggested that simvastatin could have a role in SARS-cov-2&#xD;
      infection by blocking the virus entry to cell. However, atorvastatin has been shown to&#xD;
      increase ACE2 expression in animal models. Moreover, intracellular cholesterol content seems&#xD;
      to influence the virus uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe SARS-cov-2 infection is mediated by an inflammatory storm resulting in a deep tissue&#xD;
      injury, endothelial damage, prothrombotic state and multiorgan failure. As mentioned above,&#xD;
      statins also have some potent anti-inflammatory effects as modulating TNF, the NFkB&#xD;
      transcription factor or blocking some members of the Tool Like Receptor family as TLR4-9 and&#xD;
      its downstream cofactor MYD88. This anti-inflammatory effect has been implicated in a better&#xD;
      prognosis of some diseases as HBV or HCV chronic infection, limiting the progression of&#xD;
      hepatic damage to chronic liver disease or hepatocarcinoma. The impact of statin use on&#xD;
      influenza epidemics has been repetitively assessed but contradictory or non-conclusive&#xD;
      results have been obtained. The combination of statins and angiotensin receptor blockers have&#xD;
      shown an important protective effect on other epidemics as Ebola, probably to their action on&#xD;
      endothelium protection. A protective effect of statins on pulmonary hypertension development&#xD;
      in a primate HIV model has also been reported. Although, in general all these pleiotropic&#xD;
      effects of statins have been shown in vitro and its clinical impact is not clear, a clinical&#xD;
      assay to test the efficacy of simvastatin on SARS-cov-2 is going on. Recently an&#xD;
      observational study including more than 8000 patients infected by Sars-Cov-2 showed the&#xD;
      protective effect of being on statins or ACE inhibitors. Taken into account its widespread&#xD;
      use and putative effects on viral entry, inflammation, immune mechanisms and endothelial&#xD;
      function, the use of standard therapies as statins have been postulated to target the host&#xD;
      response to new virus pandemics.&#xD;
