      This is an open-label run-in followed by a randomized, double-blind drug treatment study of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infected patients requiring inpatient hospital admission. Open-label patients will&#xD;
      be matched at least 1:10 with observational retrospective Propensity score-matched (PSM)&#xD;
      patients' medical files. The double-blinded step will be randomized 2:1 to daily Fenofibrate&#xD;
      or placebo for 10 days or hospital discharge.&#xD;

Each activity is rated in terms of degree of dyspnea (0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = mildly short of breath, 2 = moderately short of breath, 3 = severely short of breath) while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days. Total scores range from 0 to 99 with higher scores reflecting greater levels of dyspnea during daily activity.</description>
