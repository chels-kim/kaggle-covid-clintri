  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a potential shortage of life-saving mechanical ventilators.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel simpler to device, the automated&#xD;
      bag-valve-mask (BVM) compressor, can be used to provide assisted ventilation temporarily to&#xD;
      patients in need. This includes patients with COVID-19 lung infection and respiratory&#xD;
      failure. If successful, this would increase the pool of total available ventilator hours to&#xD;
      alleviate any shortage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed in the emergency department and ICU's of Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital (MGH). Thirty patients requiring mechanical ventilation will be enrolled. The design&#xD;
      is a case series with repeated measures analysis. All patients will receive the experimental&#xD;
      treatment as well as conventional ventilation and unassisted oxygenation as observed prior to&#xD;
      initiation of mechanical ventilation. The compressor used will be manufactured by Spiro LLC /&#xD;
      10xbeta based on the open source MIT design. The device is powered by an uninterrupted power&#xD;
      supply from a standard electrical outlet and it alarms if unplugged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be moved into a negative pressure room. After patients with respiratory&#xD;
      failure are intubated and stabilized on a conventional ventilator, they will receive 15&#xD;
      minutes of artificial respirations with the automated compressor with the conventional&#xD;
      ventilator standing by. They will be returned to the conventional respirator after this&#xD;
      period, or sooner if necessary. The endotracheal tube will be briefly clamped during the&#xD;
      rapid transition from one device to another to minimize aerosolization of any viral particles&#xD;
      and to retain any PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the initial study period demonstrates successful respiratory support, then the procedure&#xD;
      may be repeated once with doubling of the automated compressor treatment time to 30 minutes.&#xD;
      There will be a minimum 15-minute observation period with conventional mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      between the two study periods. Additionally, there will be one hour of data collection after&#xD;
      the study periods. The total duration of the two intervention periods, the intervening period&#xD;
      and data collection is two hours. The primary outcome is arterial oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are chemically paralyzed to facilitate intubation as part of standard care.&#xD;
      Rocuronium is typically used for intubating chemical paralysis in the MGH emergency&#xD;
      department. It has a half-life of 66 minutes. A single repeat bolus will be provided if&#xD;
      needed to ensure chemical paralysis for the duration of the study. If the patient is already&#xD;
      intubated and no longer chemically paralyzed, than one bolus of rocuronium, and a second as&#xD;
      needed, or just a temporary increase in ongoing sedation will be provided to minimize&#xD;
      spontaneous respiration. The airway circuit will be continuously monitored with a separate&#xD;
      pressure and flow monitor (Nico) with recorded digital output throughout the experiment.&#xD;
