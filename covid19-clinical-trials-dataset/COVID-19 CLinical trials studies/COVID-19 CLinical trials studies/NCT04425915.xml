  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no effective treatments are available for the COVID-19. Scientists and Researchers&#xD;
      are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and&#xD;
      medication to combat this life-threatening problem. Convalescent plasma from recovered&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against COVID-19 which may be beneficial to severely&#xD;
      sick COVID-19 patients. Investigator have recently concluded a pilot phase II open-label RCT&#xD;
      on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in severe COVID 19 patients in which encouraging&#xD;
      results were seen. Investigator plan to further study the efficacy and safety of convalescent&#xD;
      plasma in COVID-19 severely sick patients through an RCT. Investigator will collect up to 500&#xD;
      ml Convalescent Plasma from the COVID-19 recovered persons after 14 days of clinical recovery&#xD;
      with two consecutive SARS CoV-2 negative tests by PCR at least 24 hours apart. This plasma&#xD;
      will be tested and frozen and stored. On requisition it will be thawed and sent to the&#xD;
      treating center. Two doses of 250 ml convalescent plasma each will be transfused on two&#xD;
      consecutive days to patients who fit the eligibility criteria (Severely sick COVID-19&#xD;
      patients) and are randomized to the convalescent plasma group along with the standard of care&#xD;
      and the other group will receive standard of care alone. Data will be collected to study the&#xD;
      benefits and adverse events related to convalescent plasma transfusion.&#xD;
