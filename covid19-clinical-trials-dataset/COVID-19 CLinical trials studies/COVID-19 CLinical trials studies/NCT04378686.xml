  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting in late 2019, the world is facing a pandemic with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Patients&#xD;
      with end-stage kidney disease and on treatment with renal replacement therapy are high risk&#xD;
      patients, as they are unable to maximize social distancing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to gather epidemiological data using two different diagnostic approaches. We will&#xD;
      compare a symptom-driven screening, in combination with a nasopharyngeal swab plus computed&#xD;
      tomography (clinical approach) against serological surveillance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, a cluster of patients with unexplained pneumonia was linked to a novel&#xD;
      beta-coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      1. The world health organization subsequently has coined this disease as COVID-19. By the&#xD;
      time the scientific community was alerted, the epidemiological data suggested that the virus&#xD;
      had already spread to other regions of mainland China, as well as foreign cities with close&#xD;
      transport links to the original epicenter 2. The world initially answered by divergent&#xD;
      responses. Two months on, we are experiencing a devastating pandemic with local outbreaks&#xD;
      across all continents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As more and more patients arrive at the hospitals, our focus is drawn to the acute and the&#xD;
      important issues, treating large numbers of patients in grave condition. The surge in&#xD;
      patients requiring medical care may overwhelm even the most sophisticated healthcare systems&#xD;
      3. The approach adopted by almost all nations is to 'flatten the curve', i.e. to reduce peak&#xD;
      demand of healthcare resources 4. While individual countries follow different paths, the&#xD;
      common denominator is to maximize social distancing. The main goal is to reduce the basic&#xD;
      reproduction number (R0) as much as possible, to ideally less than 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overview of the clinical characteristics of confirmed cases in China alerted the world&#xD;
      that young age does not protect against infection 5. Disease severity, however, varies by age&#xD;
      with more elderly people becoming seriously ill, and by underlying medical condition(s) 6.&#xD;
      The impact on peak medical demand thus will be even greater if we succeed in maximizing&#xD;
      social distancing of the most vulnerable and most frail patients, those who are more likely&#xD;
      to become seriously ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is, however, difficult for dialysis patients who cannot self-isolate and cannot avoid&#xD;
      multiple contacts per week with health care workers and other patients. While isolating&#xD;
      dialysis patients and health care workers with a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is important&#xD;
      to limit transmission of the virus, these measures are insufficient to avoid transmission&#xD;
      since it is estimated that asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic people play a major role in the&#xD;
      spread of the virus. So far, epidemiological data in patients on IHD during an SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      outbreak are limited. A single case-series of cases from China has been reported in&#xD;
      prepublication. 37 out of 230 patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, of which 6 died (crude&#xD;
      mortality rate 16.2%). The authors suggest that not all of these died directly from the&#xD;
      consequences of COVID-19. However, adjudication of cause of death might differ in future case&#xD;
      series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard for the diagnosis of acute respiratory syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) is the detection of viral RNA in respiratory tract samples. The sensitivity of a&#xD;
      negative PCR result is, however, not 100%. False-negatives can occur, especially when using&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs (positivity rate estimated at 54%-74%) due to sampling error and in&#xD;
      patients with low viral loads, especially in patients who present at day 8 or later and mild&#xD;
      cases. While a CT scan can be a valuable tool in patients with a suspicion of COVID-9,&#xD;
      measurement of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is the only reliable way to estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection since patients can be pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number questions remain regarding the use of antibodies for epidemiologic studies and to&#xD;
      determine immunity. Can someone have a colonization with SARS-CoV-2 without developing IgG&#xD;
      antibodies? In this case, would this person be protected against reinfection? Doctors of the&#xD;
      University of Bonn recently reported on April 9th (H. Streeck et al.,data not yet published)&#xD;
      that only 15% of a sample of 1.000 inhabitants of the small town Gangelt, a local hotspot in&#xD;
      North Rhine Westphalia tested positive for IgG antibodies. These data suggest that even in&#xD;
      severely affected regions the critical threshold for herd immunity might not have been&#xD;
      reached. This means that there is a significant risk of new outbreaks, particularly after&#xD;
      schools might reopen later (maybe in summer 2020, and in fall 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that dialysis patients are at the same time potentially more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection, and cannot self-isolate, it is important to closely monitor this group of&#xD;
      patients. A second benefit of this population is that it easily accessible for blood&#xD;
      sampling, and close clinical follow-up is ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of patients who were infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 by measuring IgG antibodies at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objectives The aim of the current study is to collect epidemiological data of the&#xD;
      incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections&#xD;
      patients with end-stage kidney disease in a Belgian Hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to compare two means of detection of infection, one symptom-driven&#xD;
      surveillance and a second based on cross-sectional serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints Positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 at census date(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptom-driven surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design Cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study of prevalent patients with&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease&#xD;
