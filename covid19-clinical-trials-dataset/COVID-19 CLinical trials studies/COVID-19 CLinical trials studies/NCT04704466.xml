  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its emergence in late December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has spread rapidly,&#xD;
      causing a global health crisis. The disease caused by this highly contagious respiratory&#xD;
      virus is called COVID-19. At the beginning of August 2020, there were more than 194,000&#xD;
      confirmed cases in France - including approximately 16,000 cases in the Hauts-de-France area&#xD;
      - and more than 30,300 deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients are generally susceptible to respiratory infections, and CoV-2-SARS is no&#xD;
      exception. Early Chinese studies reported a higher rate of CoV-2-SARS infection in people&#xD;
      with cancer (or a history of cancer) than in the general population, with more severe forms&#xD;
      and with an increased risk if surgery or chemotherapy is performed in the month prior to&#xD;
      infection. The purpose of this study is to describe the management modalities of patients&#xD;
      with H&amp;N (Head and Neck) cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
      Department of CHU Amiens-Picardie.&#xD;
