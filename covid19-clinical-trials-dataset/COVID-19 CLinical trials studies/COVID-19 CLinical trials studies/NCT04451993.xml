  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As long as the people stay at home because of the Covid 19 outbreak, the investigators assume&#xD;
      that the sleep quality of OUAS patients, like everyone else, and the sleep quality of&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak are reduced due to anxiety and anxiety in people. In addition, we assume&#xD;
      that sleep quality and physical activity level are related to health literacy level and fear&#xD;
      of movement (kinesiophobia). In this study; the investigators aimed to determine how patients&#xD;
      are affected by this process by evaluating sleep quality, physical activity, fear of movement&#xD;
      and health literacy in OSAS patients during our stay in the COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research Ahi Evren Chest Cardiovascular Surgery Training Research Hospital will be performed&#xD;
      in patients between the ages of 18-70 years, diagnosed with OSAS in the sleep laboratory.&#xD;
      Sleep quality, physical activity, fear of movement and health literacy will be evaluated in&#xD;
      OSAS patients. Evaluations will be made by phone In order for the study to be strong, it will&#xD;
      be tried to reach the maximum patient that can be taken between June 2020 and October 2020.&#xD;

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire/ In activity-specific scoring, walking under the heading of the fields is calculated by the sum of the moderate intensity activity and intensive activity in itself.&#xD;
From these calculations, a score is obtained in MET-minutes. There are 3 categories of physical activity level classification. Physical activity levels are classified as physically inactive (inactive), low level of physical activity (minimally active) and sufficient level of physical activity (very active)</description>

    <description>In order to measure the general sleepiness of people during the day, it was evaluated with a standard questionnaire, which is defined as Epworth sleepiness scale (EUS) and consists of 8 questions. The answers for each question are scored between 0 and 3 and the total score is obtained. The score obtained above 10 in EUS has high sensitivity and specificity for daytime sleepiness.</description>
