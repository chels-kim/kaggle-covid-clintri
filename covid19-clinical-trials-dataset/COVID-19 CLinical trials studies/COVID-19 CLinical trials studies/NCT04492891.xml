        2. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study Disease(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that&#xD;
      causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since initial detection of the virus, more than&#xD;
      10 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, and COVID-19 is responsible for&#xD;
      more than 505,500 deaths. The United States has seen over 2.5 million cases of COVID-19 and&#xD;
      126,000 deaths from this disease (as of June, 30, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently&#xD;
      transmitted from person-to-person and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be a pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 primarily spreads through the respiratory tract, by droplets, respiratory&#xD;
      secretions, and direct contact. Current data suggest an incubation period of 1-14 days, in&#xD;
      most cases 3-7 days. The virus is highly transmissible in humans and causes severe problems&#xD;
      especially in the elderly and people with underlying chronic diseases. COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      typically present with specific, similar symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and cough. Most&#xD;
      adults or children infected with SARS-CoV-2 have presented with mild flu-like symptoms, but a&#xD;
      few patients are in critical condition and rapidly develop acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, and death. The case fatality&#xD;
      rate increases with the severity of illness and can reach up to 49% in critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, specific and effective therapies for COVID-19 are highly limited. Recent&#xD;
      evidence suggest that administration of the anti-viral agent, Remdesivir, to hospital&#xD;
      inpatients with COVID-19 decreases time to recovery from 15 to 11 days and decreases&#xD;
      mortality at 14 days from 11.9% to 7.1%. A preliminary, unpublished analysis from a large,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, open-label trial for hospitalized patients in the United Kingdom&#xD;
      showed that patients who were randomized to receive dexamethasone had a reduced rate of&#xD;
      mortality compared to those who received standard of care. This benefit was observed in&#xD;
      patients with severe COVID-19 and was greatest in those who required mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      at enrollment (RECOVERY Trial). These 2 agents are considered in the standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      for treating patients with COVID-19. However, additional therapies with larger effect sizes&#xD;
      and that are administered at earlier stages to prevent progression to severe COVID-19 are&#xD;
      critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.1 IND (Investigational New Drug) Agent(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI has filed an IND with cross-reference letter from Novartis and has received a Safe to&#xD;
      Proceed determination (IND #152065).The rationale for the proposed starting dose is based on&#xD;
      the standard renal transplantation dose, which has a time-honored profile of safety in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe COVID-19. Initial reports from cases identified between February 12 to March 16 in the&#xD;
      United States (U.S.) show rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 to be 21-31%, intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) admissions to be 5- 12%, and fatality to be 2%-3%. High-risk groups for severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 have been identified as the elderly population and those with underlying&#xD;
      comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pulmonary disease, renal&#xD;
      disease, and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe COVID-19 results from a dysregulated hyperimmune state. Severe symptoms of COVID-19&#xD;
      are associated with a hyperimmune response referred to as a cytokine storm. In one study, all&#xD;
      41 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital demonstrated elevated plasma levels of&#xD;
      cytokines and chemokines compared with healthy volunteers that included IL (Interleukin) -1,&#xD;
      -1R, -7, -8, -9, -10, and basic FGF2, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN-γ, IP10, MCP1, M1P1A, MIP1B, PDGF,&#xD;
      TNF-α, and VEGF. Patients admitted to the ICU had higher levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF,&#xD;
      IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-α than patients who did not require ICU admission. Emerging data&#xD;
      has shown that early rapid SARS-CoV-2 replication causes massive epithelial and endothelial&#xD;
      cell death that initiates a cytokine storm and vascular leakage, causes pyroptosis in&#xD;
      macrophages and lymphocytes, and results in exhaustion of T cells and NK (Natural Killer)&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 similarities to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is an&#xD;
      under-recognized, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal cytokine&#xD;
      storm and multi-organ failure. In adults, HLH is most commonly triggered by viral infections&#xD;
      and occurs in 3.7% to 4.3% cases of sepsis. Cardinal features include unremitting fever,&#xD;
      cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia. Pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in ~50% of&#xD;
      patients. Each of these clinical features and a highly overlapping cytokine profile is seen&#xD;
      in severe COVID-19. This demonstrates that the clinical presentation and pathologic&#xD;
      mechanisms of severe COVID-19 is similar to, or is HLH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclosporine (CSA) suppresses hyperimmune states. Calcineurin inhibitors such as CSA suppress&#xD;
      the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which results in decreased IL-2 production and IL-2&#xD;
      receptor expression. This interrupts a central pathway of T-cell activation and dampens T&#xD;
      cell responses and their associated cytokine storms. CSA is approved by the FDA for three&#xD;
      indications including 1) prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart&#xD;
      transplants, 2) treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) treatment of adult&#xD;
      severe recalcitrant plaque psoriasis. It is critical to consider whether dampening of T-cell&#xD;
      responses using CSA would curtail the vigor of T-cell hyperactivity in COVID-19 disease and&#xD;
      provide an opportunity for these patients to recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSA for COVID-19. Proposed is the use of the calcineurin inhibitor, CSA, for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19. This is based on: 1) observations that COVID-19 disease is associated&#xD;
      with a hyperimmune response very similar to HLH, for which treatment with CSA is effective&#xD;
      and recommended, 2) COVID-19 is associated with dysregulated macrophage activation similar to&#xD;
      macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) which is also therapeutically suppressed by CSA, and 3)&#xD;
      in vitro studies demonstrating that CSA specifically inhibits the replication of&#xD;
      coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 with a high degree of specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSA specifically inhibits coronavirus replication. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with large&#xD;
      genomes that enter host cells through binding of its transmembrane spike protein with&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed by host target cells, which is the&#xD;
      same mechanism utilized by SARS-CoV (i.e., SARS). Cyclophilins appear to play a critical role&#xD;
      in the replication of many viruses including coronaviruses, HIV, and hepatitis C virus.&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanisms are not yet well understood, in vitro studies suggest that the&#xD;
      coronavirus' nonstructural protein (Nsp) and nucleocapsid protein bind to cyclophilins, and&#xD;
      knockdown of cyclophilin expression results in near complete inhibition of coronavirus&#xD;
      replication. These data show that viral protein binding to cyclophilins is an important step&#xD;
      for successful coronavirus replication, and inhibition of this interaction by CSA prevents&#xD;
      viral replication. An important study demonstrated that CSA dominantly inhibited replication&#xD;
      of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and SARS, and that&#xD;
      treatment with increasing doses of CSA caused a dose-dependent decrease in SARS-CoV&#xD;
      replication in human cells in vitro without affecting cell viability. The same group&#xD;
      demonstrated that CSA inhibited replication of MERS-CoV without affecting cell viability of&#xD;
      mock-infected cells. An independent group demonstrated that increasing concentrations of CSA&#xD;
      treatment of SARS-CoV-infected human cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viral&#xD;
      replication, and inhibited the replication of other coronaviruses, including human CoV-NL63,&#xD;
      CoV-229E, feline CoV serotypes I and II, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV),&#xD;
      avian infection bronchitis virus (IBV), and two isolates of SARS-CoV. Taken together it is&#xD;
      proposed a dual mechanism in which (1) calcineurin inhibition by CSA inhibits the&#xD;
      phosphorylation of NFAT-P, thus preventing the production of IL-2 and other proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, and (2) CSA inhibits viral replication of coronaviruses, likely through blockade&#xD;
      of calcineurin, causing the inhibition of cyclophilins required for viral replication. Most&#xD;
      recently, it was demonstrated that CSA is highly specific and effective at inhibiting&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 replication in various human cells, via inhibition of Cyclophilin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of CSA in COVID-19. Since April 2020 mounting evidence from various patient&#xD;
      populations has strongly suggested that CSA can be used safely in patients with COVID-19. It&#xD;
      was recently demonstrated that patients with &quot;Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases&quot; (IMID)&#xD;
      on various immunosuppressive drugs related to CSA have a &quot;significantly reduced incidence of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection&quot;. It was reported no significant increase in the incidence or severity&#xD;
      of COVID-19 disease in patients undergoing CSA therapy for Psoriasis, but rather suggested a&#xD;
      potentially milder disease in these patients. Another study of over 4000 patients in Madrid,&#xD;
      Spain demonstrated &quot;a universal relationship between the use of Cyclosporine A and better&#xD;
      outcomes&quot; in patients with COVID-19 disease. In line with the findings from Spain, Cavagna in&#xD;
      Italy observed that transplant patients with ongoing Calcineurin Inhibitor therapy developed&#xD;
      only mild symptoms of COVID-19 disease and concluded that &quot;Calcineurin inhibitor-based&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens appear safe&quot; in COVID-19 disease and should not be discontinued.&#xD;
      These recent clinical outcomes data suggest that the use of CSA in patients with COVID-19 is&#xD;
      safe and potentially effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Correlative Studies Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative studies in this protocol are included as secondary endpoints and are based on: 1)&#xD;
      serum inflammatory markers used clinically as biomarkers to monitor the severity of COVID-19&#xD;
      (CRP, d-dimer, ferritin, ANC, absolute lymphocyte count, WBC (White Blood Cells), PLT), and&#xD;
      2) SARS-CoV-2 viral load by a clinical PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
