      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      SCTA01(anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody) in Healthy Chinese Subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, First-in-Human, Randomized, Double-blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Single&#xD;
      Ascending Dose Study of SCTA01(Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody) in Healthy Chinese&#xD;
      Subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be guided by a safety review of clinical signs and symptoms, adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs), and laboratory results of the prior dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Interim analysis will be performed after Day 28 post-dose for the last dose cohort for&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
