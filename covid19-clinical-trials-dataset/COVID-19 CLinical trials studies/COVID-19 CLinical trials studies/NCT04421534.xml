  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no clinically proven specific antiviral agent available for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. Supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy, remains the most important&#xD;
      management strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its discovery, lactoferrin and its related peptides are mainly considered to be&#xD;
      important non-specific host defense molecules against a broad range of viruses including&#xD;
      SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Lactoferrin has been&#xD;
      found to experimentally inhibit viral entry in murine coronavirus, and human coronaviruses&#xD;
      hCOV-NL63 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Besides reducing viral entry, lactoferrin can also&#xD;
      suppress virus replication after the viral entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another major aspect of lactoferrin bioactivity relates to its immunomodulatory and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory functions. Current thinking suggests that mortality from COVID-19 is not&#xD;
      simply due to viral infection but is a result of a cytokine storm associated with&#xD;
      hyper-inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress and subsequent mortality. A cytokine&#xD;
      profile in severe COVID-19 cases is characterized by increases in cytokines and acute phase&#xD;
      reactants and ferritin. In this regard, lactoferrin was demonstrated to reduce IL-6, TNF a,&#xD;
      and downregulate ferritin in experimental settings simulating sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to study the potential application of lactoferrin against SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      and propose the possibility of using different doses of supplemental lactoferrin as a&#xD;
      potential adjunct treatment for COVID-19.&#xD;

      COVID-19 has a wide clinical spectrum ranging between asymptomatic infection, mild upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract symptoms, and severe viral pneumonia that may result in respiratory failure&#xD;
      and finally death. There is currently no clinically proven specific antiviral agent available&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy, conservation fluid&#xD;
      management, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover secondary bacterial infection, remains&#xD;
      the most important management strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactoferrin is a highly conserved pleiotropic iron-binding 80-kDa glycoprotein of the&#xD;
      transferrin family that is expressed and secreted by glandular cells and found in most body&#xD;
      fluids with especially high concentrations in mammalian milk. Since its discovery,&#xD;
      lactoferrin and its related peptides are mainly considered to be important non-specific host&#xD;
      defense molecules against a broad range of viruses including SARS-CoV, which is closely&#xD;
      related to SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Lactoferrin has been found to experimentally&#xD;
      inhibit viral entry in murine coronavirus, and human coronaviruses hCOV-NL63 and pseudotyped&#xD;
      SARS-CoV. Given the homology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structures, as well as&#xD;
      both viruses depending on the same ACE2 receptor for cell entry, it is likely that&#xD;
      lactoferrin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 invasion as in the case of SARS-CoV. Besides reducing&#xD;
      viral entry, lactoferrin can also suppress virus replication after the viral entry as in the&#xD;
      case of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another major aspect of lactoferrin bioactivity relates to its immunomodulatory and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory functions. Current thinking suggests that mortality from COVID-19 is not&#xD;
      simply due to viral infection but is a result of a cytokine storm associated with&#xD;
      hyper-inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress and subsequent mortality. A cytokine&#xD;
      profile in severe COVID-19 cases is characterized by increases in cytokines and acute phase&#xD;
      reactants such as interleukin IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and ferritin. In this&#xD;
      regard, lactoferrin was demonstrated to reduce IL-6, TNF a, and downregulate ferritin in&#xD;
      experimental settings simulating sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to confirm the antiviral properties and immunomodulatory mechanisms&#xD;
      of lactoferrin within the context of its potential application against SARS-CoV-2 and propose&#xD;
      the possibility of supplemental lactoferrin in different doses as a potential adjunct&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data as well as the demographic information will be collected from the&#xD;
      clinicians involved in the project. All samples will be collected according to the approved&#xD;
      research protocols. During this period, the database entry platforms will be formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly distributed in 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (n=50): standard of care treatment; as per Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population&#xD;
      (MOHP) protocol, in addition to 400 mg oral lactoferrin daily Group 2 (n=50): standard of&#xD;
      care treatment; as per MOHP protocol, in addition to 600 mg oral lactoferrin daily Group 3&#xD;
      (n=50): standard of care treatment; as per MOHP protocol (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be done according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed daily on a scale reflecting a range from uninfected to dead, where&#xD;
      0 is &quot;no clinical or virological evidence of infection&quot;, 1 is &quot;no limitation of activities&quot;,&#xD;
      2 is &quot;limitation of activities&quot;, 3 is &quot;hospitalized, no oxygen therapy&quot;, 4 is &quot;oxygen by mask&#xD;
      or nasal prongs&quot;, 5 is &quot;non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen&quot;, 6 is &quot;intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation&quot;, 7 is &quot;ventilation + additional organ support - pressors, RRT (renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy), ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)&quot;, and 8 is &quot;death&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial oropharyngeal swab samples will be obtained after treatment until discharge or death&#xD;
      had occurred.&#xD;
