  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On 17th March 2020, 198 193 confirmed cases (7 730 in France) of COVID-19 infections and 7&#xD;
      854 deaths (175 in France) have been reported from 8th December 2019 in 157 countries. The&#xD;
      rapid increase in cases on french territory has led to the transition of France to level 3 of&#xD;
      the epidemic on 14th March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of the disease is still poorly understood, especially prognostic factors,&#xD;
      which are crucial for the best medical care of patients in times of epidemics, when hospital&#xD;
      capacities are under pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better knowledge of natural history, of prognostic factors, the development and validation&#xD;
      of new diagnostic tests, the evaluation of medical care, will lead to a better medical care&#xD;
      of patients infected with COVID-19.&#xD;

      The principal goal of the research is to assess the prognostic factors of the progression&#xD;
      toward severe forms of the COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are to contribute to answer some of the WHO research priority&#xD;
      goals on COVID-19 infections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the natural history of the disease, its different forms, its clinical&#xD;
           characterisation, its progression profile, the natural history of the disease linked to&#xD;
           patient profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation and to comparison of different diagnostic methods, linked to the medical case&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the progression of the immune response during the infection and related&#xD;
           to its outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the replication and the excretion of the virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the progression of the biological markers during the infection and&#xD;
           related to its outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of the prognostic factors of the evolutive profile, especially if&#xD;
           negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the patients care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of the impact of the different therapeutic managements on the clinical&#xD;
           outcome, the immune response, the viral load and the biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modeling of the epidemiologic impact&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of targets for treatment development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of cost data linked to the progression The population will include all patients&#xD;
           infected with SARS-CoV2 ou suspected of being, who are taken care of at hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is based on the collection of clinical and biological data from routine cares&#xD;
      and on the biological analysis of blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal goal of the COVI-BIOME ancillary study is to identify gastrointestinal&#xD;
      predictive factors for a severe form of the COVID-10 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal goal of the COVIDOG ancillary study is to evaluate the sensibility and the&#xD;
      specificity of canine olfactory detection for the volatile organic compounds of SARS-CoV2.&#xD;
