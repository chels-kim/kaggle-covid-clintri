  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a current pandemic infection caused by an RNA virus called&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe forms of COVID-19 are&#xD;
      most often responsible for isolated respiratory failure in the form of acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS), which accounts for most of the mortality. Angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a co-receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells and&#xD;
      is likely to play a prolonged role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. ACE2 and angiotensin&#xD;
      (1-7) have been shown to be protective in a number of different lung lesion models. In a&#xD;
      mouse model of acidic lung injury, negative regulation of ACE2 by COVID, the SARS virus&#xD;
      responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, worsened the lung injury which was improved by&#xD;
      treatment with ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that blocking the first RAS pathway at the end of the chain on the AT1r&#xD;
      angiotensin 2 receptor may prevent the initiation of this chain reaction and limit&#xD;
      decompensation secondary to the disruption of the equilibrium of the renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system. We have several molecules that block the AT1r angiotensin-2 receptor (ARBs) as well&#xD;
      as a molecule that blocks the secretion of aldosterone (spironolactone). The main objective&#xD;
      is to demonstrate the value of losartan and spironolactone therapy in the regulation of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system in improving the prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled, therapeutic trial&#xD;
      studying two parallel groups. The population included in this study is any major patient in&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress hospitalized in intensive care requiring oxygen support of at&#xD;
      least 6L/min and suffering from a PCR-confirmed SARS-cov2 infection. The control group will&#xD;
      benefit from the usual resuscitation management of COVID19 , and the experimental group will&#xD;
      benefit from losartan and spironolactone treatment in addition to the usual management,&#xD;
      according to the study protocol. The number of subjects required has been calculated and 45&#xD;
      patients for each group, for a total of 90 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SOFA score at D7 will be compared between the &quot;experimental&quot; versus &quot;control&quot; groups&#xD;
      using a mean comparison method. The comparison of this criterion and all secondary criteria&#xD;
      of judgments between the 2 groups will be performed using a Student or Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      based on the normality of the distribution. The significance threshold will be set at 0.05.&#xD;
      No intermediate analysis is scheduled. The analysis will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main expected outcome is an improved prognosis with a decrease in the SOFA severity score&#xD;
      at 7 days in resuscitation patients, resulting in an improvement in organ failure. The&#xD;
      expected secondary results will be to show the interest of ARA2/Spironolactone treatment on&#xD;
      oxygenation based on the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, mechanical ventilation duration and mortality.&#xD;
