  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre prospective study will enroll a sufficient number of patients to afford&#xD;
      approximately 60 positives and &gt; 40 negatives (as determined by the SOC - Comparator method)&#xD;
      in the United States and/or Canada. One to three sites in the United States and/or Canada&#xD;
      will participate over an approximate 12-week enrolment period. The actual enrolment period&#xD;
      will be dependent upon prevalence of Covid-19. Once positives sample size is achieved,&#xD;
      expected SARC-CoV-2 negative subjects will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational and will not impact the medical management of the patient. The&#xD;
      results of the Spartan Test will be blinded to the clinical staff during the study and will&#xD;
      not impact the medical management of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained and eligibility is confirmed, subject demographics, and&#xD;
      patient reported COVID-19 symptoms will be recorded. For the purposes of this study,&#xD;
      enrolment will be defined as the collection of the two study-specific nasopharyngeal (NP)&#xD;
      samples for Spartan's Test. Each patient's active involvement in the study will last for&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support the EUA, a minimum of 30 individual natural positive clinical specimens will be&#xD;
      collected from patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a healthcare provider in&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease endemic regions in the United States. Additionally, a minimum of 30&#xD;
      individual negative samples will also be used to support the EUA from patients in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once subjects are consented and recruited for the study, three nasopharyngeal samples for&#xD;
      each patient will be collected by trained operators at the clinical site. The first sample&#xD;
      will be tested at the clinical site according to standard of care protocols currently in&#xD;
      place for the sites' nasopharyngeal swab-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. The second&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal sample will be tested at the site using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System. The&#xD;
      third nasopharyngeal sample will be tested using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System only when the&#xD;
      test conducted with the second nasopharyngeal swab does not produce a positive or negative&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample for the SOC test will be collected prior to the samples for the Spartan COVID-19&#xD;
      v2 System as per clinical regulations.&#xD;
