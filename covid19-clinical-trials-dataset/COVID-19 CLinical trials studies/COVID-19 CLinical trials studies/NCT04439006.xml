    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib and how well it&#xD;
      works in treating patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Ibrutinib may help&#xD;
      improve COVID-19 symptoms by lessening the inflammatory response in the lungs, while&#xD;
      preserving overall immune function. This may reduce the need to be on a ventilator to help&#xD;
      with breathing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility and tolerability of administering ibrutinib in COVID-19&#xD;
      infected patients and determining the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). (Phase Ib) II. To&#xD;
      determine whether ibrutinib administration (Arm A) in cancer patients can diminish the need&#xD;
      for artificial ventilation (mechanical ventilation, bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]&#xD;
      or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) or death due to COVID-19 as compared to&#xD;
      untreated control population receiving standard therapy (antiviral, chloroquine,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, cytokine blocking peptides or small molecules) (Arm B). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time to defervescence (oral temperature &lt; 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit [F]&#xD;
      for a 48 hour time period) among patients treated with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control&#xD;
      population receiving standard (Arm B) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine time to clinical resolution of need for supplemental oxygen (i.e.&#xD;
      maintenance of oxygen saturation of 93% or greater on room air with ambulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of ICU admission for&#xD;
      patients treated with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control population receiving standard therapy&#xD;
      (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine rate of shock requiring vasopressor support for patients treated with&#xD;
      ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control population receiving standard therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the rate of secondary infection (bacterial, fungal, viral) for patients&#xD;
      treated with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control population receiving standard therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the time to hospital discharge for patients treated with ibrutinib (Arm A)&#xD;
      versus control population receiving standard therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine time to hospital discharge and rate of death for patients who cross over to&#xD;
      ibrutinib (Arm A) from standard therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine grade 3 or higher toxicity observed in patients treated with ibrutinib&#xD;
      (Arm A) versus control population receiving standard therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine time to mechanical ventilation, the number of days of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      per patient and total observed in patients treated with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control&#xD;
      population receiving standard therapy (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the impact of baseline clinical features (e.g. type of cancer, active therapy),&#xD;
      duration of symptoms prior to admission and laboratory features (e.g. T cell count) on&#xD;
      outcome for patients treated on this therapeutic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the proportion of patients with viral clearance at end of ibrutinib therapy,&#xD;
      time of hospital discharge and follow up thereafter among patients treated with ibrutinib&#xD;
      (Arm A) versus control (Arm B) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the time and proportion of patients who develop immunoglobulin (Ig)M and&#xD;
      IgG levels toward SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-2 treated with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control&#xD;
      treatment (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine immune cell subsets for absolute number, activation, exhaustion markers, and&#xD;
      presence of maturation arrest (natural killer [NK] cells) at baseline and over time among&#xD;
      patients treated with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control (Arm B) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To examine T-cell repertoire over time among patients treated with ibrutinib (Arm A)&#xD;
      versus control (Arm B) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the influence of epigenetic age, clonal hematopoiesis, and monoclonal B cell&#xD;
      lymphocytosis (MBL) on treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine serial change in inflammatory markers as CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and&#xD;
      cytokines including IL6, IL1B, and TNF-alpha serum levels over time among patients treated&#xD;
      with ibrutinib (Arm A) versus control (Arm B) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 12 patients will all receive ibrutinib. In the randomized part, patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 7 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who remain hospitalized or are re-admitted after 2 cycles may receive an additional&#xD;
      2 cycles per physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive usual care. Patients who meet the requirement of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation may cross-over to Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.&#xD;
