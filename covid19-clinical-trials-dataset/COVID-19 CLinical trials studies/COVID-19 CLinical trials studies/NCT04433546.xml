  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of pemziviptadil (PB1046) by improving the clinical outcomes in hospitalized&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients at high risk for rapid clinical deterioration, acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who require urgent&#xD;
      decision-making and treatment at approximately 20 centers in the United States.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening/Pre-treatment period, on-site randomization to study&#xD;
      treatment. On Day 0 (Visit 2) subjects who meet inclusion criteria and none of exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will receive a weekly subcutaneous injection that will continue once weekly until&#xD;
      hospital discharge or for a maximum of 4 weeks during hospitalization, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be randomized to either a low control (10 mg), middle (40 mg), or high (100&#xD;
      mg) dose of active treatment. If subject is not discharged, they will continue to Day 7, 14,&#xD;
      21 treatments. Pemziviptadil (PB1046) is expected to improve the clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      hospitalized COVID-19 subjects with an earlier hospital discharge and improvement in&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of hospitalization for each subject will be determined by clinical status&#xD;
      independent of study procedures. The estimated duration of the study for each subject,&#xD;
      including screening, is approximately 35+7 days. The subjects may be involved up to 42 days.&#xD;
