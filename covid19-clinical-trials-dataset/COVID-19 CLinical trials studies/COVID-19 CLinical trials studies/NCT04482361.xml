  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of a new coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, has spread&#xD;
      rapidly and is a major public health challenge. While the focus is primarily on containing&#xD;
      the number of cases and finding alternative therapies, information is still lacking to&#xD;
      elucidate the dynamics of viral circulation and to understand the distribution of the&#xD;
      infection in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cases reported in Argentina and worldwide could plausibly represent only a small&#xD;
      proportion of the number of asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic cases that exist in society.&#xD;
      However, the magnitude of this dissociation between symptomatic cases and asymptomatic&#xD;
      persons is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing this information is of strategic importance as it will allow the estimation of a&#xD;
      community prevalence and the evaluation of the best containment strategy. In fact, although&#xD;
      all social distancing measures are now indispensable, the feasibility of prolonging the&#xD;
      measure over time is a complex issue and in any case will require population-based&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best way to approach the estimation of a true population prevalence is to take&#xD;
      representative samples from the population and test them periodically. These experiences were&#xD;
      carried out in other contexts showing heterogeneous results within the community studied. In&#xD;
      Spain, for example, the range of antibodies present in the population varied from 1.1% to&#xD;
      14.2%, also showing that an important part of the population had had contact with the virus&#xD;
      without symptoms. Studies in Switzerland and the United States also show similar findings.&#xD;
      However, these estimates are not automatically transferable to other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The city of Buenos Aires has a particular demographic composition with an important group of&#xD;
      the population living in shantytowns (it is estimated that between 7% and 10% of the&#xD;
      population lives in shantytowns) and with much heterogeneity among the different communes of&#xD;
      the city. In the villas, the incidence rates of COVID-19 infection differ significantly from&#xD;
      those present in the group &quot;outside the village&quot;. However, there is also an important&#xD;
      difference in the incidence rates by commune, even without considering the villas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is important to know the sero-epidemiology of antibodies against SARS-COV2 in a&#xD;
      representative sample of the city of Buenos Aires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, a nationally produced test (COVIDAR IgG) developed by professionals from&#xD;
      CONICET and Instituto Leloir will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this initiative is to estimate the true dimension of the COVID-19 epidemic in the&#xD;
      City of Buenos Aires, by studying the immunological status of the Buenos Aires population in&#xD;
      relation to SARS-Cov2, as well as to observe the evolution of the infection among the&#xD;
      population, since this information is essential to guide future public health measures&#xD;
      related to the control of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this objective, a comprehensive sero-epidemiological study will be carried out to&#xD;
      provide estimates of past SARS-Cov2 infection with sufficient precision to be representative&#xD;
      of the sero-epidemiological status of the Buenos Aires city population.&#xD;

        The present study will be a transversal study carried out on 1,800 people over 18 years of&#xD;
        age resident in CABA for 10 working days, between the months of July and August. The survey&#xD;
        will be repeated in August and September.&#xD;
