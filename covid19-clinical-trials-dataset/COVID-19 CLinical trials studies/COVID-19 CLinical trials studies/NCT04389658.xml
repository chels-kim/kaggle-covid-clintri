  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late December 2019, a new coronavirus strain emerged in China causing coronavirus disease&#xD;
      2019 (COVID-19). Since then, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic outbreak being declared a&#xD;
      &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot; by the International Health Regulations&#xD;
      Emergency Committee of the WHO on January 30, 2020. Several emergency measures have been&#xD;
      implemented in different countries such as lockdown, social distancing and testing. However,&#xD;
      due to the lack of tests worldwide the real number of affected and/or immunized people&#xD;
      remains largely unknown. In this moment, when reopening phases are being undertaken in the&#xD;
      majority of countries, the decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgement&#xD;
      of each health care system. However, every country or individual community circumstances may&#xD;
      be unique and require contextual consideration based on the severity and time of the pandemic&#xD;
      as well as the number of resources available. The present study aims to retrospectively&#xD;
      describe the immune and infective spectrum of illness from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the general asymptomatic population in three main&#xD;
      areas of Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia) with high impact of COVID-19, right after the&#xD;
      lockdown period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In late December 2019, a new coronavirus strain emerged in Chinese megacity Wuhan. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) named it Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV2) leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On January 30, 2020 the&#xD;
      International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the WHO declared the outbreak a&#xD;
      &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot;. On March 11, 2020 WHO characterized&#xD;
      COVID-19 as a pandemic and on March 14th, the Spanish President COVID-19 outbreak a &quot;national&#xD;
      emergency&quot; for second time in 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to fight this unanticipated pandemic, emergency measures have been implemented in&#xD;
      different countries such as lockdown, social distancing and testing. Massive community&#xD;
      testing to detect early or asymptomatic infections as well as social distancing has been used&#xD;
      in certain countries (South Korea, Iceland, etc..) with relatively success. In this sense,&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is considered to be the gold standard to diagnose the&#xD;
      infection with SARS-CoV2. On the other hand, Enzyme Linked ImmunoAssay (ELISA) has also been&#xD;
      widely used to determine the presence of antibodies (Immunoglobulins M, A and G) and, hence&#xD;
      immunological status. Some studies have reported the presence of IgM and IgA antibodies&#xD;
      within the first 5 days of clinical symptom onset, while IgG is usually detected on 14 days&#xD;
      after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7% and 77.9%, respectively. Moreover,&#xD;
      a recent report of reveals that positive detection rate is significantly increased when&#xD;
      combined IgM/IgA ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compare with a single quantitative PCR&#xD;
      test. In this sense Igenomix has recently obtained the authorisation by the Valencia&#xD;
      Community Authority to provide these services after completing the requested process of&#xD;
      verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this moment, when reopening phases are planning or even undertaken in the majority of&#xD;
      countries, the decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgement of each&#xD;
      health care system. However, every country or individual community circumstances may be&#xD;
      unique and require contextual consideration based on three main factors: the severity of the&#xD;
      pandemic spread, the measures and timing implemented during the pandemic, and the moment of&#xD;
      the post pandemic that this population is in. Therefore, international metrics are urged to&#xD;
      guide the re-opening of the post pandemic era in different parts of the world to provide a&#xD;
      logical approach to mitigate risk to new outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective, observational study in which anonymized data from subjects who&#xD;
      already performed PCR and ELISA test for COVID-19 detection at Igenomix, will be used to&#xD;
      assess the rate of immunized population as well as the rate of asymptomatic contagious&#xD;
      population in three hot spots of Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia) immediately after the&#xD;
      lockdown period. After data collection and processing, once the full anonymization process&#xD;
      has been completed, the pool of data will be analyzed with the aim of retrospectively&#xD;
      describe the immune and infective spectrum of illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the&#xD;
      general asymptomatic population in three main areas of Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia)&#xD;
      with high impact of COVID-19. Moreover, other additional descriptive variables such as age,&#xD;
      gender, etc will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being an observational retrospective study, the sample size would consist of the complete&#xD;
      database of individuals analyzed by ELISA and PCR from areas of Madrid, Barcelona and&#xD;
      Valencia representing approximately 1,000 cases. Waiver of informed consent form has been&#xD;
      duly authorized by the Ethic Committee in agreement to the local legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention involving patients or their biological material will be required.&#xD;
