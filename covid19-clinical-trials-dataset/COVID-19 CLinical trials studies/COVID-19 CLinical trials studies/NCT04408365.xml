  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with approximately 5% of all patients which require&#xD;
      intensive care unit admission. In critically ill patients infected with COVID-19,&#xD;
      approximately 15% had severe shock requiring medications to increase blood pressure. It&#xD;
      appears that blood vessel tone is altered and microcirculation is not well regulated in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19. The underlying pathophysiology and contributing factors are unknown.&#xD;
      The association with subsequent organ dysfunction and outcome is also unclear. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate serial changes of relevant biomarkers in this population to&#xD;
      improve the understanding of this disease, to investigate the association with clinically&#xD;
      important outcomes and to find out how best to treat patients. The data will serve to develop&#xD;
      strategies for individualised management of this high-risk group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with approximately 5% of all patients requiring&#xD;
      admission to an intensive care unit. In critically ill patients infected with COVID-19, acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is found in 40%, 11.9% required continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (RRT), and 13.4% had vasodilatory shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, supportive treatment is the mainstay treatment, with fluid administration and&#xD;
      vasopressors for haemodynamic support and lung-protective ventilation in patients with severe&#xD;
      respiratory failure.3 Targeted drugs, antiviral therapies, and vaccines are still currently&#xD;
      being developed, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any drug over&#xD;
      another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysregulation of vasomotor tone and alteration of microcirculatory function are common in&#xD;
      patients infected with COVID-19. The underlying pathophysiology and contributing factors are&#xD;
      unknown. The association with subsequent organ dysfunction and outcome is also unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating bio-adrenomedullin regulates vascular tone and endothelial permeability during&#xD;
      sepsis, and has been shown to associate with 28-day mortality, vasopressor requirement, RRT,&#xD;
      and positive fluid balance. Proenkephalin is a biomarker of glomerular function, and was&#xD;
      shown to elevate in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), especially in those with&#xD;
      persistent AKI, and major adverse kidney events. Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP-3) is a&#xD;
      myocardial depressant factor, which is involved in angiotensin II cleavage. High DPP-3 levels&#xD;
      were associated with severe organ dysfunction and short-term mortality. In critically ill&#xD;
      patients, COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular dysfunction and&#xD;
      high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may be linked to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      COVID-19. The coronavirus receptor utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter&#xD;
      target cells. Endogenous angiotensin II is hypothesized to prevent binding of coronavirus to&#xD;
      ACE2, causing internalization and downregulation of ACE2, and causing lysosome-mediated&#xD;
      destruction of ACE2. There are no human studies in COVID-19 patients to confirm this&#xD;
      hypothesis yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very little knowledge of underlying pathogenesis in patients with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      vasodilatory shock. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate serial changes of&#xD;
      relevant biomarkers in this population to give further understanding of this disease and to&#xD;
      investigate the association with clinically important outcomes. The data will serve to&#xD;
      develop strategies for individualized management of this high-risk group.&#xD;
