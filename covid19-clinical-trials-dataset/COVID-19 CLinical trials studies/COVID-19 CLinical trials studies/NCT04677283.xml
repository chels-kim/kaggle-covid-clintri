  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to study the prevalence of Covid-19 in EHPAD. The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be the combination of PCR results and symptomatology, making it possible to define positive&#xD;
      cases in EHPAD, in residents and professionals in contact with them. The prevalence obtained&#xD;
      can be compared with the results of serology if these are performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is taking place in several nursing homes in Ile-de-France, which will be recruited&#xD;
      at the end of the diagnostic campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initiative of the ARS Ile-de-France, residents and professionals of selected EHPADs&#xD;
      will be subjected to systematic screening by RT-PCR for Covid-19, then by serology after the&#xD;
      first screening, regardless of whether either the result&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples, by nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR, by capillary blood sampling or venipuncture&#xD;
      according to the technique for serology, will be carried out according to the doctrines&#xD;
      issued by the ARS Ile de France and the variations proposed by the appropriate departmental&#xD;
      directorates in depending on local resources. The results will be brought to the attention of&#xD;
      EHPADs to adapt the care of residents and positive professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected daily from collection for the first test (RT-PCR), or retrospectively&#xD;
      if the collection took place before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the approach for collecting serologies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects included with a negative PCR will be offered the serological test, in&#xD;
           accordance with the recommendations in force or the medical decisions of the&#xD;
           establishments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The qualitative results of the serologies of the subjects included in the study&#xD;
           (residents and professionals) will be collected according to the same circuit as those&#xD;
           of the RT-PCRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only the symptoms of residents with a positive serology will be collected, from the date&#xD;
           of the sample and for a period of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The symptoms of professionals with a positive serology can be collected, from the date&#xD;
           of the sample and for a period of 14 days without mandatory character.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both techniques (ELISA or TROD) are accepted and the serology values will not be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
