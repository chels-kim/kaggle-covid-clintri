  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Face masks are important for prevention of transmission and contracting viruses such as&#xD;
      COVID-19. Gymnasiums have been identified as being susceptible to virus transmission;&#xD;
      therefore, wearing face masks during exercise is important during pandemics. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate performance and physiological stress during high-intensity exercise while wearing a&#xD;
      face mask during Crossfit exercise training.&#xD;

      Face masks are important for prevention of transmission and contracting viruses such as&#xD;
      COVID-19. Gymnasiums have been identified as being susceptible to virus transmission;&#xD;
      therefore, wearing face masks during exercise is important during pandemics. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate performance and physiological stress during high-intensity exercise while wearing a&#xD;
      face mask during Crossfit exercise training. Twenty-four men and women will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to perform exercise during Crossfit exercise while wearing or not wearing a surgical&#xD;
      face mask in a cross-over study. Two types of exercise sessions will be assessed: A high&#xD;
      intensity interval session and a continuous exercise session. There will therefore be four&#xD;
      exercise sessions evaluated in our randomized cross-over design: 1) high intensity exercise&#xD;
      while wearing a face mask; 2) high intensity exercise with no face mask; 3) continuous&#xD;
      exercise while wearing a face mask; 4) continuous exercise with no face mask. Outcome&#xD;
      variables to be assessed include exercise performance during the sessions (total repetitions&#xD;
      for pull-ups, push-ups, and squats during continuous exercise and total repetitions for box&#xD;
      jumps during high-intensity exercise). Heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and dyspnea&#xD;
      will also be assessed throughout the exercise sessions.&#xD;
