      Abstract :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is an infectious acute respiratory caused by the&#xD;
      novel coronavirus. The virus is a positive-strand RNA virus with high homology to bat&#xD;
      coronavirus. Depending on published study in which , conserved domain analysis, homology&#xD;
      modeling, and molecular docking were used to compare the biological roles of specific&#xD;
      proteins of the novel coronavirus. The principal investigator demonstrated according to&#xD;
      previous researches that some viral structural and nonstructural proteins could bind to the&#xD;
      porphyrin, respectively. At the same time, orf1ab, ORF10 and ORF3a proteins coordinated to&#xD;
      attack heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin, COVID-19 binds to the porphyrin of haem and&#xD;
      displaces iron and a study denonestrated that Covid-19 could cause acquired acute porphyria&#xD;
      which is the condition in which there is excess accumulation of porphyrin intermediate&#xD;
      metabolites. This point can be taken advantage of X-ray induced visible luminescence of&#xD;
      porphyrin for producing of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).Many porphyrins are benign in the&#xD;
      dark but are transformed by sunlight into caustic, flesh-eating toxins Porphyrins have been&#xD;
      used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) against a wide range of targets like bacteria, viruses&#xD;
      and tumor cells It has been reported that ROS-based inactivation of viruses may occur due to&#xD;
      several reasons, such as protein oxidation, single strand breaks in the RNA genome and&#xD;
      protein-RNA crosslinking. Since ROS-based inactivation has a multi-targeted mechanism, it is&#xD;
      much less likely that a virus would be able to develop resistance against it. Recently,&#xD;
      porphyrins, already in use as photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), were a study&#xD;
      target to applications in medical area, namely as possible contrast agents in MRI. could be&#xD;
      observed some examples of porphyrin derivatives already study as MRI contrast media. Low dark&#xD;
      toxicity, neoplastic tissue affinity and synthetic accessibility are some of the important&#xD;
      properties that contribute for its selection. In MRI studies was found that CM based on&#xD;
      paramagnetic metalloporphyrins showed higher affinity for neoplastic tissues, observed by&#xD;
      increased relaxation time of the neoplastic tissues, which is reflected on an increase in MRI&#xD;
      signal and consequently in a better neoplastic lesions detection. A study demonestrated that&#xD;
      The sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin contrast agents in MRI (TNapPS), sulfonated&#xD;
      tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine&#xD;
      [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99,&#xD;
      96, 94, and 96%, respectively. Previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to the&#xD;
      porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and&#xD;
      light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct&#xD;
      types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya&#xD;
      and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules&#xD;
      able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy.&#xD;
      Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX&#xD;
      (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the&#xD;
      antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb&#xD;
      is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus. Porphyrin treatment causes viral envelope protein&#xD;
      loss, affecting viral morphology, adsorption and entry into target cells , Finally, the&#xD;
      principal investigator expect that viral load will be declined with sunlight because In&#xD;
      particular, porphyrins absorb essentially all the UV/visible light wavelengths in the&#xD;
      emission spectrum of the sun; hence they are active at very low doses .&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pandemic Covid-19 pneumonia, of SARS-CoV-2 aetiology, presents an existential threat to&#xD;
      health care systems globally. Multiple therapeutic and prophylactic agents are currently&#xD;
      undergoing clinical trial, including 23 clinical trials of (hydroxy) chloroquine in China.&#xD;
      While progress towards a curative agent or vaccine is promising, the principal limiting&#xD;
      factor in public health emergency is time, and therefore Virus resistance to antiviral&#xD;
      therapies is an increasing concern that makes the development of broad-spectrum antiviral&#xD;
      drugs urgent. Targeting of the viral envelope, a component shared by a large number of&#xD;
      viruses, emerges as a promising strategy to overcome this problem. Natural and synthetic&#xD;
      porphyrins are good candidates for antiviral development due to their relative hydrophobicity&#xD;
      and pro-oxidant character a pre-existing licensed therapeutic would offer reprieve to health&#xD;
      care systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this brief communication, the Principal&#xD;
      investigator argues that Covid-19 has high probability of being more than a disease of&#xD;
      pneumonia, and that critical Covid-19 patients may be experiencing a form of acquired acute&#xD;
      porphyria. Readily available interventions exist to treat acute porphyria and the position is&#xD;
      advanced that urinalysis of critical Covid-19 patients would diagnose this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 binds to porphyrin and cause acquired porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythrocytes are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Wuhan University&#xD;
      researchers argue that the role of erythrocytes in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 is&#xD;
      under-estimated; the co-efficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is&#xD;
      predictive of severity of disease state (Gong 2020). Elevated RDW is correlated with reduced&#xD;
      erythrocyte turnover; red blood cells become smaller as they age and the delay in clearance&#xD;
      expands the low-volume tail of the volume distribution (Patel 2015). Suppressed erythrocyte&#xD;
      turnover may indicate erythropoietic distress and function as a compensatory mechanism to&#xD;
      maintain circulating red blood cell levels (Patel 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess porphyrins in red blood cells can precipitate cell lysis and development of hemolytic&#xD;
      anaemia (Sassa 2006). Macaques infected with SARS-CoV- 2 also have decreased red blood cell&#xD;
      numbers (Munster 2020) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be determined by blood&#xD;
      group; blood group A is most affected whereas blood group O seems to be protected (Yang&#xD;
      2020). This finding is concordant with previous studies showing that susceptibility to the&#xD;
      2003 strain of SARS-CoV was determined by blood group (Guillon 2008). Preliminary evidence&#xD;
      suggests that CD147, the determinant of the Ok blood group system, binds the spike protein of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (Wang 2020). Incidentally, CD147 functions as an essential receptor for&#xD;
      erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum (Crosnier 2011). Blockade of CD147 abrogates&#xD;
      the normal recirculation of erythrocytes, from the spleen into the general circulation,&#xD;
      leading to selective trapping of red blood cells in the spleen as development of a form of&#xD;
      anaemia (Coste 2001). Autopsy of deceased Covid-19 patients reveals that the spleen is&#xD;
      significantly reduced in size. Reduction in spleen size would be expected in the event that&#xD;
      the spleen has emptied its reserve of erythrocytes into the circulation as part of a normal&#xD;
      physiological response to anaemia (Dale 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primate models of Covid-19 (Munster 2020) and human Covid-19 patients have subnormal&#xD;
      haemoglobin levels (Chen 2020). Clinical evaluation of almost 100 Wuhan patients reveals&#xD;
      haemoglobin levels below the normal range in most patients as well as increased total&#xD;
      bilirubin and elevated serum ferritin (Chen 2020). Hyperbilirubinemia is observed in acute&#xD;
      porphyria (Sassa 2006) and would be consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis (Sulovska&#xD;
      2016) and rapid haemoglobin turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 and Porphyrin of haem:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated serum ferritin levels are typical of acute porphyria (Trier 2013) and would be&#xD;
      expected upon dissociation of iron from haem. A mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 might attack&#xD;
      the 1beta chain of haemoglobin has been proposed; the product of open reading frame 8 (ORF8)&#xD;
      binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron, according to bioinformatics prediction&#xD;
      analyses (Liu 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxygen-carrying capacity of erythrocytes would therefore be compromised by SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      thereby exacerbating the difficulties already experienced by the patient, in terms of&#xD;
      maintaining partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PaO2). While the impact of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      targeting of haemoglobin on oxygen content of the blood would therefore be considerable, the&#xD;
      author proposes that perhaps of greater concern, are potential ramifications upon homeostatic&#xD;
      regulation of haem anabolism. Haem biosynthesis is exquisitely controlled by seven&#xD;
      enzyme-controlled reactions proceeding from the first intermediate, aminolevulinic acid&#xD;
      (ALA), to haem as thefinal product. Haem negatively regulates the first step in the pathway&#xD;
      by repressing expression of aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARSCoV- 2 is predicted to directly interfere with haem production (Liu 2020), and this&#xD;
      prediction is supported by empirical evidence of reduced haemoglobin levels in Covid-19&#xD;
      patients (Chen 2020) and in animal models of the disease (Munster 2020). Decreased haem&#xD;
      production dampens repression of ALAS, and thereby increases the production of haem&#xD;
      precursors, leading to accumulation of porphyrin intermediate metabolites. All of the haem&#xD;
      pathway intermediates are potentially toxic (Sassa 2006). During an attack of acute&#xD;
      porphyria, ALAS is induced 2006) and this perturbation continues until sufficient haem&#xD;
      synthesis is restored. Phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 porphyrin excess is hypothesised to mimic&#xD;
      extreme lead poisoning; both as examples of acquired acute porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overproduction of haem precursors - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), in&#xD;
      particular - manifests life-threatening attacks (Pischik 2015) with neurovisceral symptoms&#xD;
      (Sassa 2006), including: abdominal pain (85-95% cases), vomiting (43-88%), constipation&#xD;
      (48-84%), muscle weakness (42-60%), mental symptoms (40-58%), pain of the limbs, head, neck&#xD;
      and chest (50-52%), hypertension (36-54%), tachycardia (28-80%), convulsion (10-20%), sensory&#xD;
      loss (9-38%), fever (9-37%), respiratory paralysis (5-12%) and diarrhoea (5-12%).&#xD;
      Neurotoxicity of aminolevulinic acid accounts for the plethora of neurovisceral symptoms and,&#xD;
      interestingly, there is considerable overlap between neurovisceral complaints of ALA excess&#xD;
      and extra-pulmonary symptoms of critical Covid-19 patients. Extra-pulmonary symptoms of&#xD;
      Covid-19 are significant but under-estimated, including gastrointestinal symptoms (Poggiali&#xD;
      2020), which news reports suggest may affect in the region of 50% Covid-19 patients.&#xD;
      Neurological problems also appear to be overlooked by the hyper-focus on respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      (Zhao 2020). Of 214 Covid-19 patients, 36.4% experienced neurological manifestations&#xD;
      including: headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular incidents and impaired consciousness&#xD;
      (Mao 2020). Loss of autonomic control of breathing has also been reported and autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy is a clinical feature of acute porphyria (Laiwah 1985). Neuropsychiatric symptoms&#xD;
      of Covid-19 may be downstream of irregularities in haem metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important question is now asked by Principal investigator Can Sunlight stimulated&#xD;
      porphyrins act against COVID-19 as like as Sn- protoporphyrin IX mechanism in impeding the&#xD;
      entry and division of the virus(Zika, Chikungunya and other arbo viruses) by targeting the&#xD;
      viral envelope and protect hemoglobin and blood components that are affected by the viral&#xD;
      infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator expect the possibility of inhibiting Covid -19 by Sulfonated&#xD;
      porphyrins X-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrin and light-stimulated Sn-&#xD;
      protoporphyrin IX because According to previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to&#xD;
      the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and&#xD;
      light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct&#xD;
      types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya&#xD;
      and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules&#xD;
      able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy.&#xD;
      Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX&#xD;
      (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the&#xD;
      antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb&#xD;
      is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus. Porphyrin treatment causes viral envelope protein&#xD;
      loss, affecting viral morphology, adsorption and entry into target cells (Neris 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin (TNapPS), sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin&#xD;
      (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper&#xD;
      chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99, 96, 94, and 96%, respectively&#xD;
      (Andrei 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of HepG2 cells with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX after DENV infection reduced infectious&#xD;
      particles without affecting viral RNA contents in infected cells. The reduction of viral load&#xD;
      occurs only with the direct contact of DENV with porphyrins, suggesting a direct effect on&#xD;
      viral particles. Previously incubation of DENV and YFV with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX resulted&#xD;
      in viral particles inactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Biliverdin, a noncyclical&#xD;
      porphyrin, was unable to inactivate the viruses tested. Infection of HepG2 cells with&#xD;
      porphyrin-pretreated DENV2 results in a reduced or abolished viral protein synthesis, RNA&#xD;
      replication and cell death. Treatment of HepG2 or THP-1 cell lineage with heme or CoPPIX&#xD;
      after DENV infection with a very low MOI resulted in a decreased DENV replication and&#xD;
      protection from death. (Assunção 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, SARS-CoV-2 would not be the first known virus to alter porphyrin metabolism;&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (Hep C) and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection lead to a non-acute&#xD;
      form of porphyria (Blauvelt 1996). So the principal investigator expects and suggests that&#xD;
      porphyrin based therapy is suitable and effective treatment against COVID-19 and could&#xD;
      Protects hemoglobin and RBCs from dangerous influence of COVID-19 .The possibility of&#xD;
      therapeutic application of porphyrins or their use as models to design new antiviral drugs&#xD;
      against DENV ,COVID -19 and YFV.&#xD;
