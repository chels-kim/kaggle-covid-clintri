      Phase 2a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of EIDD-2801 in adult&#xD;
      men and women who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 144 hours of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation and&#xD;
      are hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Rapid enrollment and treatment will be&#xD;
      initiated such that the first dose of EIDD-2801 or placebo will be administered as soon as&#xD;
