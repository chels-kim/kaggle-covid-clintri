  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at clarifying whether early treatment with continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) ventilation is able to reduce the need for intubation or death in patients visiting an&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) with known or suspected COVID-19 infection and insufficiency&#xD;
      respiratory.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized to two treatment arms: current clinical practice&#xD;
      (control arm) and early treatment with CPAP in addition to current clinical practice&#xD;
      (experimental arm). To deal with the current emergency situation, the study will adopt an&#xD;
      adaptive design with a Bayesian continuous monitoring. Such design allows to stop the study&#xD;
      as soon as the data provide sufficient evidence of efficacy or ineffectiveness of the studied&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the combination of intubation or death within 7 days of&#xD;
      randomization. The secondary endpoint is 30-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients arriving at the ED will be evaluated to verify the presence of inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Randomization will be performed through an ad-hoc electronic case report&#xD;
      form (eCRF). Eligible patients should be randomized as soon as possible, possibly immediately&#xD;
      after the ED triage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control arm will be treated according to current clinical&#xD;
      practice, which currently does not involve the use of CPAP. Therefore, these patients should&#xD;
      not start treatment with CPAP immediately after randomization. CPAP treatment, however, is&#xD;
      allowed at a later stage, if deemed appropriate according to clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the experimental arm should begin treatment with CPAP as soon as&#xD;
      possible. CPAP should only be performed with a helmet, using a positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP) between 8 and 14 cmH2O and an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 40 and&#xD;
      60%. FiO2 and PEEP must be modulated, within the limits indicated above, so as to obtain a&#xD;
      saturation &gt; 94%. Whenever this goal cannot be achieved, the patient should be referred to&#xD;
      the intensivist.&#xD;
