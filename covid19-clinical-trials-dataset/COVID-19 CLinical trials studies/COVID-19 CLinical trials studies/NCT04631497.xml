  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical personnel working in the Intensive Care Unit will be examined by means of tests.&#xD;
      Their aim is to check how work-related stress in a potentially lethal threat affects the&#xD;
      occurrence of depression, stress, anxiety and sleep disorders. We also want to check whether&#xD;
      people working in such extremely difficult conditions show no greater interest in death.&#xD;

      Every day medical staff working in very difficult conditions of intensive care. The COVID-19&#xD;
      virus outbreak has set another difficult task for doctors and nurses who have previously had&#xD;
      a lot of contact with the death of their patients. The appearance of the COVID-19 virus and,&#xD;
      above all, the inability to effectively treat the infection causes an additional&#xD;
      psychological stimulus in medical personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the occurrence of psychiatric disorders in medical&#xD;
      personnel dealing with patients suffering from COVID-19 using various psychological tests.&#xD;

    <description>Beck's test the BDI-II contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original:&#xD;
0-13: minimal depression 14-19: mild depression 20-28: moderate depression 29-63: severe depression</description>

    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)&#xD;
The PSS predicts both objective biological markers of stress and increased risk for disease among persons with higher perceived stress levels. For example, those with higher scores (suggestive of chronic stress) on the PSS fend worse on biological markers of aging, cortisol levels, immune markers, depression, infectious disease,wound healing, and prostate-specific antigen levels in men. PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positivelystated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made fromquestions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.</description>

    <description>the scale of the fascination with death The Death Obsession Scale (DOS) was made by Abdel-Khalek. It was intended to be a main component in the death distress const.ruct: death anxiety, death depression, and death obsession. The DOS assesses a multidimensional trait. It is responded to on a five-point Likert-type rating scale as follows: No (1), A little (2), A fair amount (3), Much (4) and Very much (5). The total score can range from 15 to 75.</description>
