      presentation of COVID-19 patients to the ED. The course of the disease prior to admission as&#xD;
      well as the momentary health status at presentation to the ED are of interest because they&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COVID-19 usually present in the ED and receive their initial medical check-up&#xD;
      here. It is the ED where crucial diagnostic and therapeutic steps are taken and where the&#xD;
      decision for admission or discharge is made. As of now, the effectiveness and value of these&#xD;
      initial measures and decisions are unclear. With still raising numbers of infections despite&#xD;
      regulatory constraints in place, there is an urgent need to develop valid decision trees on&#xD;
      how to treat patients suspected with COVID-19 in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the already described risk factors little is known about if and to which degree an&#xD;
      infection with COVID-19 itself predisposes to other acute conditions (e.g. myocarditis,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction or stroke). We will try to gather information of comorbidities and&#xD;
      other conditions at the time of presentation of COVID-19 patients to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all patients seek medical consultation at the very beginning of symptoms. The course of&#xD;
      the disease prior to admission as well as the momentary health status at presentation to the&#xD;
      ED are of interest because they influence risk stratification and decision-making of treating&#xD;
      physicians. For example: an immunocompromised patient who presents with mild symptoms at a&#xD;
      very early stage of COVID-19 would probably be deemed more at risk than the same patient who&#xD;
      reports mild symptoms without progression for a duration of several weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of patients with mild or moderate to severe symptoms will help to calculate the&#xD;
      need for hospital beds including beds on Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Intermediate Care&#xD;
      Units (IMC), as well as the need for other hospital resources. It will also help to identify&#xD;
      the need for capacities in ambulatory care. COVID-19 Patients with mild or moderate symptoms&#xD;
      can remain in quarantine at home. This would not only disburden hospitals but would also&#xD;
      lower the risk for previously uninfected patients otherwise having to share rooms and wards&#xD;
      with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirming the diagnosis There is uncertainty with regard to the best initial diagnostic in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. Diagnostic tool of choice is a low-dose CT-scan of the thorax, which will&#xD;
      detect typical radiologic signs of COVID-19 (ground-glass-opacities, bilateral consolidations&#xD;
      and &quot;crazy paving&quot;) with a high sensitivity, and in some cases even before onset of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. However, these features are also seen in other viral pneumonias and specificity&#xD;
      reaches only 25%. Moreover, a CT-scan might not be available 24/7 in all hospitals, is&#xD;
      time-consuming and exposes radiologic personnel to the risk of infection. Additionally, as is&#xD;
      described later, many patients present with severe hypoxemia, a situation in which they might&#xD;
      not be able to lie in a supine position in the CT-scanner. The role of lung ultrasound (LUS)&#xD;
      in detection of COVID-19 has not been examined properly so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing for COVID-19 usually is done using an oral swab (or expectorated sputum) and&#xD;
      real-time PCR (RT-PCR) after a clinical suspicion based on different parameters and/or after&#xD;
      visits of the patient to regions with high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of this&#xD;
      method has not been systematically evaluated, however, false-positive, as well as&#xD;
      false-negative results have been reported. Moreover, there are sometimes contradictory&#xD;
      results of RT-PCR and CT-scan. The registry will be used to collect and compare diagnostic&#xD;
      data from radiological exams as well as RT-PCR-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many COVID-19 patients present with shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Physicians have used&#xD;
      different therapeutic approaches including high-flow oxygen (HFNC), non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      or intubation and mechanical ventilation. While a trial with non-invasive methods is deemed&#xD;
      safe and adequate by most experts, others have raised concerns and advocate early intubation&#xD;
      and invasive ventilation in COVID-19. Participants of the registry will be asked to state the&#xD;
      method of oxygenation/ventilatory support that was initiated in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission vs. discharge As has already been laid out, patients with COVID-19 exhibit symptoms&#xD;
      of different severity. It is neither possible nor would it be reasonable to hospitalize every&#xD;
      patient in which the condition is suspected or confirmed. Unfortunately, there are no&#xD;
      diagnostic markers or laboratory cut-offs that help decide if a COVID-19 patient who presents&#xD;
      to the ED has to be hospitalized or can be safely managed in ambulatory care. Our goal is to&#xD;
      gather information of outcomes in both hospitalized and discharged patients and to compare&#xD;
      this data with epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiologic data from the date of&#xD;
      their visit to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED is the first contact to a hospital. Diagnostic and therapeutic measures from patients&#xD;
      who are hospitalized due to the severity of their disease will be analyzed as well as&#xD;
      complications or death during hospitalization. The duration of hospitalization will be&#xD;
      analyzed and compared to the initial clinical picture.&#xD;
