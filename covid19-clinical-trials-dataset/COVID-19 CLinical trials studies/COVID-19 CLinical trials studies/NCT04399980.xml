  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, Phase 2, multi-center, blinded randomized placebo-controlled study is&#xD;
      designed to demonstrate that early treatment with mavrilimumab prevents progression of&#xD;
      respiratory failure in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia and clinical and biological&#xD;
      features of hyper-inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes patients who have severe pneumonia, defined as hospitalization&#xD;
      due to Covid-19 with abnormal chest imaging and SpO2 &lt;92% on room air or requirement for&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: The study will be performed in approximately 4 months total, starting from the&#xD;
      first patient enrolled with enrollment expected to complete within 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period: The follow-up period is 60 days for each patient enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio: 30 subjects will&#xD;
      receive mavrilimumab, and 30 subjects will receive placebo infusion. The investigator,&#xD;
      clinical team, and subject will be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified by regular review of hospitalized COVID19 patients to&#xD;
      evaluate for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will then be approached in the&#xD;
      standard manner by study investigator and coordinator/research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research interventions will take place in the hospital in accordance with privacy standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team is informed on all study procedures and requirements with daily meetings and&#xD;
      the opportunity to continuously update through secure channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter consortium, each participating site will have their own IND for patients&#xD;
      enrolled at their site. Data collection will occur at each of the 4 academic centers, and&#xD;
      data analysis and randomization scheme will be performed by one site, Cleveland Clinic C5&#xD;
      Research.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;

                  assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject&#xD;

               -  Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine&#xD;
                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception&#xD;
