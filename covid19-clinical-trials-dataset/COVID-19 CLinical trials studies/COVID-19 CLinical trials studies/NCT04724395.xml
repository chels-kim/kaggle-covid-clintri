      The purpose of the study is to describe disability following hospitalization in people of&#xD;
      working-age surviving COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee in China identified an outbreak with&#xD;
      viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was identified as the causal agent.&#xD;
      The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named COVID-19. While most people with COVID-19&#xD;
      develop uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe forms of the disease and 5%&#xD;
      are critically ill, potentially leaving survivors with non-fatal sequelae. To date, the&#xD;
      long-term burden of COVID-19 and patients' perspectives and needs have been left unaddressed.&#xD;
      As compared to 2003 SARS outbreak, one can anticipate persisting disability in COVID-19&#xD;
      survivors, including specific post-COVID and non-specific post-intensive care syndromes. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that dramatic COVID-19-specific and non-specific mid- and long-term&#xD;
      disabilities would persist in people surviving COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective will be to provide a deep understanding of non-fatal health outcomes in&#xD;
      people surviving COVID-19, by comprehensively and systematically mapping and monitoring,&#xD;
      within the WHO ICF framework, disability levels and profiles, in the mid and long terms in&#xD;
      people surviving COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disability levels will be assessed at 9 (±3), 18 (±3) and 24 (±3) months using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parts 1a (impairments of body functions) and 2 (activity limitation and participation&#xD;
           restriction) of the WHO ICF checklist v2.1, administered by a health care provider, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-administered 36-item WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The secondary objectives will be to describe COVID-19 specific and non-specific&#xD;
      impairments, activity limitations and participation restriction at 9 (±3), 18 (±3) and 24&#xD;
      (±3) months in people surviving COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impairments, participation restrictions and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 9&#xD;
           (±3) , 18 (±3) and 24 (±3) months will be assessed using online specific&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaires and face-to-face specific tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-pharmacological / pharmacological treatments at baseline, 9 (±3), 18 (±3) and 24&#xD;
           (±3) months will be self-reported&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total costs, cost drivers and estimated Years-Lived with Disability (YLDs) at 24 (±3)&#xD;
           months will be calculated B. Another secondary objective will be to assess the burden of&#xD;
           the patient's SARS-CoV-2 infection on the patient's close relative, between M9-inclusion&#xD;
           and M24 patient visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The burden on patient's close relative will be assessed using specific printed&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaires&#xD;
