      The purpose of the study is to investigate the addition of high frequency chest wall&#xD;
      oscillation (HFCWO) therapy to the prescribed care regimen to support the diaphragm during&#xD;
      airway clearance among post-COVID patients with COPD and chronic productive cough as a way to&#xD;
      limit the advancement of pulmonary symptoms and need for critical services during recovery&#xD;
      from COVID-19.&#xD;

      Thirty study participants in New York City who meet inclusion criteria will be recruited from&#xD;
      Mount Sinai's COVID-19 Post-Recovery Center of Excellence and Respiratory Institute. Fifteen&#xD;
      subjects (determined by the last digit of their medical record number) will receive a HFCWO&#xD;
      device (AffloVest), digital thermometer, pulse oximeter, and spirometer at their home.&#xD;
      Participants will be trained remotely to use the AffloVest and spirometer. In addition all&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to complete a series of online mental health and respiratory symptom&#xD;
      assessments via REDCap. A 15 patient control group meeting inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Mount Sinai COVID-19 Post-Recovery Center of Excellence and Respiratory&#xD;
      Institute using the same screening process. This group will not receive the HFCWO&#xD;
      intervention but will receive a digital thermometer, pulse oximeter, and spirometer at their&#xD;
      home (with training via telehealth), asked to complete all REDCap and respiratory symptom&#xD;
      assessments. Consent for both groups will be obtained by a Mount Sinai clinician-researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration Approximately 30 days plus 60 and 90-day check in&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To investigate the addition of HFCWO therapy to the prescribed care regimen to&#xD;
      support the diaphragm during airway clearance among post-COVID patients with COPD and chronic&#xD;
      productive cough as a way to limit the advancement of pulmonary symptoms and need for&#xD;
      critical services during recovery from COVID-19.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Presence of pneumonia symptoms via Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Symptom Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>CAP Symptom Questionnaire records how much the patient rated the bothersomeness of the symptom. Each item is scored as &quot;0&quot; (Patient did not have this symptom), &quot;1&quot; (Not at All) to &quot;5&quot; (Extremely). Full range scale from 0 to 90, higher score indicating patient experiencing more frequent or more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of life via Quality of Life Questionnaire-Respiratory (QOL-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The QOL-B is a disease-specific questionnaire that measures symptoms, functioning, and health-related quality of life relevant to patients with bronchiectasis. Scores are generated from 37 items that fall on 8 domains: Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, Treatment Burden, Health Perceptions, and Respiratory Symptoms. All subscales and the full range scale are standardized to score from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better enjoyment and satisfaction with specific life domains.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mental health screening via Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-8 is the depression module, which scores each of the eight DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Full scale from 0-24, with higher score indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The General Anxiety Disorder 7-item questionnaire (GAD-7) is a 7-item questionnaire that asks user to rank how often they have been bothered by seven problems over the past two weeks from &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Full scale from 0-21, with higher score indicating more symptoms.</description>
