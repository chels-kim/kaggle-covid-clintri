  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused clusters of severe respiratory&#xD;
      illness similar to SARS and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. There is no&#xD;
      confirmed antivirus therapy for people infected 2019-nCoV, most of them should receive&#xD;
      supportive care to help relieve symptoms. This clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      Fuzheng Huayu tablet on lung inflammation in intensive patients with novel coronavirus&#xD;
      pneumonia and reduce the progressive rate to critical type.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which&#xD;
      spread rapidly. Some of the patients developed into severe or critical illness. It became an&#xD;
      international concerned public health emergencies and one of the major epidemics seriously&#xD;
      endangering people's health and public safety after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)&#xD;
      in 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, we lack the specific treatment for NCP. The anti- novel coronavirus drugs are&#xD;
      been conducting in clinical trials, and the other options includes the symptomatic treatment.&#xD;
      The pathological mechanism of the disease is not clear, but due to the continuous development&#xD;
      of inflammation, some cases can become severe or critical, which threatening the life and&#xD;
      health of patients. Intensive cases with obvious inflammation, after the control of acute&#xD;
      symptoms and signs, often have the performance of pulmonary fibrosis, affecting the recovery&#xD;
      of lung function. Therefore, actively reducing lung inflammation, controlling and reversing&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis is of great significance for the life and health of patients Infected&#xD;
      novel coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous study found that Fuzheng Huayu prescription can reduce the inflammation and&#xD;
      fibrosis of the lung in the model rats, and improve the lung function of the patients with&#xD;
      COPD. Therefore, we hope to take Fuzheng Huayu tablet to NCP patients, and observe whether it&#xD;
      can reduce the lung inflammation of patients, so as to reduce the rate of progression of&#xD;
      critical illness.&#xD;
