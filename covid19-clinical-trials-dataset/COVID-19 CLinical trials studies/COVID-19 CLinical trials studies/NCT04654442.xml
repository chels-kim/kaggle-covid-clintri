  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 rapid progression worldwide are already historical landmarks&#xD;
      of the 21st century owing to the magnitude of the event and the collective response that&#xD;
      populations have adopted to face such threat. This menace has imposed an unprecedented&#xD;
      reactivity to promptly deliver answers in various fields and specifically in termes of&#xD;
      diagnostic capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very first tests to be used were based on PCR reactions and on deep nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      sampling. But this has shown to be insufficient to prevent contaminations and limit the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. This approach requires important infrastructure thus limiting the&#xD;
      extent to which it can be delivered. Moreover, nasopharyngeal swab is highly intrusive and&#xD;
      therefore is not suitable for repeated testing of asymptomatic patients in surveillance&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual need is based on new tests offering new capabilities both in terms of wide range&#xD;
      availability, ease of use and reduced time-to-result duration. Such tests, affordable and&#xD;
      that can be performed outside the lab would ultimately relief pressure on healthcare workers&#xD;
      and laboratory facilities as well as help test massively wide range of populations thus&#xD;
      limiting viral dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such innovating test device has been developped by the start-up &quot;Grapheal&quot; and the present&#xD;
      study will ultimately demonstrate the feasibility of COVID-19 diagnostic using this test.&#xD;

      ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGIES Actual strategy for rapid and accurate&#xD;
      diagnostic relies heavily (almost solely) on RT-PCR based tests. The French Scientific Board&#xD;
      advising the national government in the management of this epidemic has brought back on&#xD;
      September, 3rd the three-axis policy : &quot; Test - Track - Isolate &quot; as the central response to&#xD;
      the COVID-19 progression. This strategy is also the response promoted by WHO since March. If&#xD;
      properly applied, this approach allows high-performance in identifying positive cases and&#xD;
      spotting transmission chains, thus allowing to specifically isolate and quarantine infectious&#xD;
      patients. The expected outcome is a halting epidemic allowing economic recovery and&#xD;
      protection of populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rise in French laboratory capacities regarding their ability to perform the required tests&#xD;
      has been achieved since the early days of COVID-19. Since August, 10th we have reached the&#xD;
      pace of 100.000 daily tests nationwide and peaked above 300.000 tests per day as of October,&#xD;
      26th (Sant√© Publique France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the need to lockdown the entire French population for a second time is the&#xD;
      demonstration of the limits of this strategy. Issues can be summarized in a few key points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The hassle of performing as many tests as needed over the whole national territory has&#xD;
           proven difficult and does not allow control of local epidemic bursts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repetitive sampling for asymptomatic patients to confirm viral clearance and lack of&#xD;
           viral shedding raises strong questions regarding its feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for high quality sampling for RT-PCR tests accurately reaching nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           cavity requires trained staff whose availability is limited. Swab collection remains an&#xD;
           important bottleneck nationwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Important consumption of PPE (personal protective equipment) for sampling staff adds an&#xD;
           unnecessary tension in supply chains In the light of these issues, there is an urgent&#xD;
           need to transition from RT-PCR tests to novel diagnostic techniques capable of&#xD;
           addressing the above-mentioned key problems. Rapid Antigenic Tests are being evaluated&#xD;
           and used already in some facilities and in very controlled settings. However, these&#xD;
           tests do have important limitations and their relatively low sensibility in real-life&#xD;
           setting (around 60% of positive agreement with RT-PCR for best-performing tests) is an&#xD;
           issue that need to be quickly addressed to avoid jeopardizing efforts made to widespread&#xD;
           tests and keep public confidence. Moreover, Rapid Antigenic Tests deliver results in 15&#xD;
           to 30 minutes' time, much faster than traditional RT-PCR, but still inadequate for&#xD;
           massive population test in crowded places and public gathering (airports, shows and&#xD;
           sporting events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABOUT MEDICAL DEVICE INVOLVED&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vincent BOUCHIAT is a team leader, former research senior and principal investigator from&#xD;
      French science agency CNRS in the field of material science and physics, and he established&#xD;
      in 2019 a start-up (Grapheal) in Grenoble to upcycle his fundamental work on the unique&#xD;
      properties of graphene, allowing the synthesis of electronic polymers with bio-compatibility&#xD;
      and biological detection capacities. This work is patent-protected in cooperation with local&#xD;
      university (UGA) which grants sustainability in the development of such technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since March 2020, Grapheal has been working on a single-use specific biosensor called&#xD;
      'TestNPass digital Covid Ag test strip' thus allowing the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. This&#xD;
      biosensor uses the electronic detection of the biochemical matching between specific&#xD;
      antibodies directed against the virus. The docking of the virus by stabilized antibodies&#xD;
      leads to a change in conductance within the sensor electronic circuit, similar to Seo and&#xD;
      colleague's work. This variation in electric conductance is measured by an ultraportable and&#xD;
      autonomous circuit that can be paired with either a computer or a smartphone in order to be&#xD;
      further analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proof of concept of the device has been realized by in vitro experiments putting together&#xD;
      commercial samples containing recombinant structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with&#xD;
      the detection electrodes of the disposable antigenic test strip after dilution in a saline&#xD;
      solution (PBS). Tested samples with Nucleocapsid and Spike proteins were able to trigger a&#xD;
      change in conductance, thus allowing detection of the viral surrogate. Protein concentrations&#xD;
      have been adjusted to match in vivo concentrations and an important work has been performed&#xD;
      to ensure signal processing is robust, reliable and repeatability of the measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encryption of the result within the on-board processing circuits of the device allow the&#xD;
      development of a device fully compliant with personal data protection and grating GDPR&#xD;
      compliance from the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEASIBILITY AND PAST EXPERIENCE OF INVOLVED TEAMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team from Grapheal is hosted within the BioPolis incubator facility which presence close&#xD;
      to Grenoble Teaching Hospital (CHUGA) allows for narrow collaborations. This start-up&#xD;
      highlight the performances of bio sensing technologies based on graphene polymers. Grapheal&#xD;
      team has 7 members, all of them holding PhDs in biological sciences or physics. The team is&#xD;
      led by Vincent BOUCHIAT, who is a former principal investigator from French national agency&#xD;
      for scientific research (CNRS). The team has been granted with prizes and rewards among which&#xD;
      the i-lab 2020 contest held by the French Ministry of Scientific Research and Higher&#xD;
      Education for innovating technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project, the team has joined its forces with specialists of IVD and medical devices&#xD;
      as well as knowledgeable support from regulation specialists. Ultimately the team has been&#xD;
      requesting the help from the virology team from Grenoble University Hospital (CHUGA) in order&#xD;
      to set up the present proof-of-concept study, the first of its kind to be performed in human&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virology team from Grenoble University hospital (CHUGA) is a pioneer in the development&#xD;
      of molecular based assays for viral diagnostic. Some of the now classical PCR and RT-PCR&#xD;
      widely used for routine diagnostic in France have been set up within our team and laboratory.&#xD;
      These techniques and PCR kits now branded by BioM√©rieux company have been developed by&#xD;
      collaborators from our lab, thus granting us with a wide experience in diagnostic technique&#xD;
      and molecular based technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is performed within our laboratory since the early&#xD;
      days of the pandemic. We have been dealing with the very first infected patients from France&#xD;
      as early as February, 8th 2020. The diagnostic of these patients has greatly improved since&#xD;
      then and SAR-CoV-2 detection is now performed as a regular daily test at an unprecedented&#xD;
      rate. Along with the development of cutting edge techniques including pseudo-virus&#xD;
      neutralization assays, our team now holds a highly skilled expertise regarding to COVID-19&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both microbiological and clinical teams from CHUGA have been producing research projects and&#xD;
      data about COVID-19 pandemic. More than 10 clinical studies have been set-up and half of&#xD;
      these protocols now enroll patients on a daily basis. One of those has closed after inclusion&#xD;
      of more than 200 subjects. Moreover, cooperation has been developed to reach more than 50&#xD;
      shared research projects with collaborators in France. Among those, the nation-wide projects&#xD;
      DISCoVery and French-COVID have been main protocols where we matched expected targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, these past experiences are key for future success in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has a main target of demonstrating the feasibility of the Grapheal&#xD;
      TestNPass device to accurately distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infections in a tested population. If&#xD;
      conclusive, the evaluated test could help detect and therefore limit the spread of the virus&#xD;
      upon national territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root hypothesis is as following: the bond between the antibody directed against viral&#xD;
      proteins and the virus itself is enough to generate within a graphene base semi-conductor a&#xD;
      change in conductance that is measurable and repeatable. This electric current can therefore&#xD;
      be used as a surrogate of viral infection, viral shedding and viral infectiousness. Obtained&#xD;
      result being an electric impulse, it will be easily transferred to a device for digital&#xD;
      display.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, the present study will bring to light some of the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crucial information about ergonomic of the device for future development and improving.&#xD;
           This study being the first use outside of Grapheal's team, the feedbacks from users will&#xD;
           be of great help to support future development of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary data on analytical performances. Will the main goal of the present study is&#xD;
           to demonstrate the feasibility of COVID-19 diagnosis with the device, key performance&#xD;
           date such as sensitivity, specificity, positive agreement and negative agreement will be&#xD;
           estimated. This will serve as a strong basis for both future studies and approval from&#xD;
           regulatory agencies&#xD;
