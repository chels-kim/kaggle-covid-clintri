  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of oral Foipan® (camostat mesilate) compared with the&#xD;
      current standard of care in reducing the duration of viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus in&#xD;
      patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend 4 study visits over a period of up to 28 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of COVID-19 disease as presence of mild-moderate symptoms without signs of&#xD;
             respiratory distress, with FDA-cleared molecular diagnostic assay positive for&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours prior to informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must be sterile, OR agree not to donate semen AND agree to strictly adhere to&#xD;
             contraceptive measures during the study and for seven days following the last dose of&#xD;

             incapable of fathering a child, OR, if of childbearing potential will strictly adhere&#xD;
             to contraceptive measures during the study and for seven days following the last dose&#xD;
             of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must agree to stop breast-feeding prior to first dose of study drug and&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant bacterial respiratory infection documented by respiratory culture. NOTE:&#xD;
             Subjects on empirical antibiotic treatment for possible but unproven bacterial&#xD;
             pneumonia, but who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, are allowed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of antiviral drugs that may be active against Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal laboratory test results at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of adrenocorticosteroids (except topical or inhaled preparations or oral&#xD;
             preparations equivalent to or less than 10 mg of oral prednisone) or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             or immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., immunosuppressants, anticancer drugs, interleukins,&#xD;
             interleukin antagonists or interleukin receptor blockers). NOTE: Treatment of study&#xD;
             participants following institutional COVID-19 treatment policies or guidelines,&#xD;
             including the use of immunomodulatory medications, is permitted. This excludes&#xD;
             treatment with agents that have the potential for direct antiviral activity, including&#xD;
             convalescent plasma and NO, and co-enrollment into other clinical studies that&#xD;
             evaluate investigational agents for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious chronic disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], cancer requiring&#xD;
             chemotherapy within the preceding 6 months, and/or moderate or severe hepatic&#xD;
             insufficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously received camostat mesilate within the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
