  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 pandemic now affects more than two million people worldwide. The neurotropism of the&#xD;
      virus is assumed by its frequent association with neurological symptoms (anosmia, ageusia,&#xD;
      headaches) but the extent of the central or peripheral nervous system involvement and the&#xD;
      associated symptomatology remain poorly known for now. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      describe the neurological and psychiatric manifestations occurring in the context of Covid-19&#xD;
      infection in patients hospitalized or followed-up in the APHP.SU hospital group. A better&#xD;
      understanding of the neuropsychiatric impairment related to Covid-19 would improve the&#xD;
      management of these patients in the acute phase, and knowledge of subsequent complications&#xD;
      would allow adapting their rehabilitation and follow-up. The precise phenomenological&#xD;
      description of these manifestations and the imaging, biology and neuropathology data will be&#xD;
      compiled from the data collected by the physicians in charge of these patients as part of&#xD;
      their inpatient or outpatient care. This study will also allow collecting unusual clinical&#xD;
      manifestations from patients followed for neurological or psychiatric pathology in hospital&#xD;
      departments and presenting a Covid-19 infection, in order to optimize the reorganization of&#xD;
      their management, follow-up and rehabilitation in the epidemic context.&#xD;

      Pandemic context In December 2019, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection&#xD;
      (Covid-19) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The virus quickly spread to other&#xD;
      Chinese provinces and then to the rest of the world. The first cases in France were diagnosed&#xD;
      on 23 January 2020 in patients who had been in China, and the number of cases rapidly&#xD;
      increased to 100 confirmed cases on 29 February 2020. As of 16 April, 106,206 patients had&#xD;
      been confirmed, 6,457 patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, and the number of&#xD;
      deaths linked to Covid-19 in hospital was 10,643 (government.fr). At the same date, more than&#xD;
      2,065,906 cases were confirmed worldwide, with more than 137,124 deaths (jhu.edu). The most&#xD;
      commonly reported clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an infectious syndrome&#xD;
      associated with respiratory signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19 To date, little is known about&#xD;
      neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19. Some authors suggested a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients with central neurological manifestations such as headache, confusion,&#xD;
      seizures or strokes. Some cases of COVID-19 encephalitis have also been reported: a case of&#xD;
      acute haemorrhagic encephalitis, and a case of encephalitis with seizure and positive&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the CSF. Neurological impairment of Covid-19 has been proposed as a&#xD;
      contributing mechanism to respiratory failure in some patients with severe disease. Anosmia&#xD;
      and ageusia are now recognized as common symptoms of the infection. Cases of Guillain-Barré&#xD;
      syndrome and probable myelitis (without radiological confirmation) have also been described.&#xD;
      Myalgia is frequently reported in patients with Covid-19 infection, but no cases of&#xD;
      documented myopathy have been reported to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Covid-19 infection may also present systemic encephalopathy in the context of&#xD;
      severe respiratory failure, associated organ failure (renal, hepatic), and iatrogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for severe forms of the infection frequently&#xD;
      present with confusion, and sometimes persistent cognitive disorders such as a dysexecutive&#xD;
      syndrome, attention disorders, spatio-temporal disorientation. A high frequency of clinical&#xD;
      signs of cortico-spinal bundle damage and leptomeningeal contrast images on cerebral MRI has&#xD;
      also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding psychiatric manifestations, a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive&#xD;
      syndromes was noted in patients with Covid-19. Post-traumatic stress disorder may also occur&#xD;
      in these patients, particularly those who have suffered from severe forms of stress and have&#xD;
      been hospitalized in intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family and bears a strong similarity to other&#xD;
      coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Clinical and preclinical knowledge of other&#xD;
      coronaviruses suggests neurotropism of viruses of this family. In particular, infection with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 or NCoV-OC43 may cause encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. The SARS-CoV-2 virus&#xD;
      adheres to cell membranes by interaction with ACE2 receptors, which are highly expressed on&#xD;
      the surfaces of neurons and glial cells. The ACE2 receptor is particularly expressed in the&#xD;
      brainstem and in regions involved in cardiovascular control including the paraventricular&#xD;
      nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract. The virus could reach the nervous system via&#xD;
      systemic circulation (viremia) or via ethmoidal microcirculation via the olfactory&#xD;
      epithelium. Indeed, animal studies have shown that SARS-Cov can invade the brain via the&#xD;
      olfactory epithelium via the nasal route and cause neuronal death. The virus could also&#xD;
      infect the brain through trans-synaptic transmission from the olfactory epithelium through&#xD;
      the ethmoidal floor to the olfactory bulb. Another mechanism of neurological damage related&#xD;
      to Covid-19 infection could be the initiation of an immune reaction with the release of&#xD;
      cytokines and other inflammatory proteins, leading to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier,&#xD;
      which amplifies neuro-inflammatory processes. Systemic inflammation and cytokines may also&#xD;
      promote ischemic stroke. Severe coagulopathies have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 and pre-existing neurological and psychiatric disorders SARS-CoV-2 infection could&#xD;
      lead to the aggravation of certain pre-existing neurological and psychiatric disorders, but&#xD;
      the potential impact of the infection in the short, medium and long term on these pathologies&#xD;
      is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, infections are a classic aggravating factor in many neurological pathologies, such as&#xD;
      autoimmune pathologies, metabolic pathologies, and also neurodegenerative pathologies. Brain&#xD;
      inflammation is recognised as an important mechanism of neurodegenerative pathologies and has&#xD;
      also been implicated in psychiatric pathologies such as schizophrenia and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cardiac or respiratory damage, particularly in the context of neuro-muscular&#xD;
      pathologies, could particularly develop severe forms of infection. Patients with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative pathologies often represent an elderly population, and therefore also at&#xD;
      risk of severe forms of infection. Patients followed for inflammatory or neuro-oncological&#xD;
      pathologies and undergoing immunosuppressive treatments or chemotherapy also represent a&#xD;
      at-risk population. SARS-CoV-2 infection could also worsen certain psychiatric pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public interest research Neurological and psychiatric manifestations have been reported in&#xD;
      patients with Covid-19 but the different neuropsychiatric expressions of Covid-19 infections&#xD;
      are currently not well characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the neurological and psychiatric impairment related to Covid-19&#xD;
      could improve management of the patients in the acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of neurological and psychiatric complications subsequently occurring would allow&#xD;
      adapting the follow-up of these patients. The inclusion of prospective long-term follow-up&#xD;
      data is crucial in the overall understanding of the neuropsychiatric disorders of Covid-19.&#xD;
      Neurological complications are likely to occur at a distance from the infection or to be&#xD;
      lately diagnosed, for instance, in patients who have been in intensive care. The collection&#xD;
      of data from the rehabilitation follow-up of these patients is crucial in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise phenomenological description of these manifestations and the collection of&#xD;
      imaging, biological and neuropathological data may also allow establishing hypotheses on the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of the neurological damage caused by Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of Covid-19 infection on pre-existing neurological and psychiatric pathologies is&#xD;
      not known. This knowledge would optimize the reorganization of the management, follow-up and&#xD;
      rehabilitation of these patients in the epidemic context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational, retrospective, multicentre study, the investigators aim at i)&#xD;
      describing the clinical and paraclinical manifestations of patients with neurological or&#xD;
      psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19 infection, and ii) describing changes in the clinical&#xD;
      trajectories of patients with Covid-19 infection, initially followed for neurological or&#xD;
      psychiatric pathologies.&#xD;
