      Telemedicine is an application that provides remote healthcare services. Telemedicine method&#xD;
      has been reported to be useful in chronic conditions such as cerebral palsy (CP). Patients&#xD;
      with CP need regular follow-up, regular physiotherapy, orthosis use, using of antispasmodic&#xD;
      drugs, repeated botulinum toxin applications or intrathecal baclofen to reduce spasticity and&#xD;
      increase functionality. During the Covid-19 pandemic period, these patients could not come to&#xD;
      their controls due to reasons such as difficulty in reaching the doctor, fear of infection&#xD;
      transmission, could not continue physiotherapy, repeated botulinum toxin applications could&#xD;
      not be performed and necessary operations could not be performed. In this cross sectional&#xD;
      study, investigator aimed to analyzed the effect of Covid-19 pandemic on the&#xD;
      physical-psychosocial and cognitive state of the children, to benefit form the health,&#xD;
      education services and the caregiver's quality of life with telemedicine.&#xD;
