      This is an open label, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of losartan in&#xD;
      respiratory failure due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, 50 patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure who meet eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      agree to participation in the study will be placed on losartan 25 mg daily on study day 0. If&#xD;
      parameters are met the dose of losartan will be increased to 50 mg once daily on study day 3.&#xD;
      Participants will continue losartan until they experience resolution of respiratory failure&#xD;
      (normal oxygen levels on room air), are discharged from the hospital, meet stoppage criteria&#xD;
      (detailed below) or complete 14 days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and/or surrogate decision maker who do not give consent to treatment will be asked&#xD;
      to allow collection of data from their medical record for use as a control group. We will&#xD;
      also collect medical information relating to safety criteria on historical controls treated&#xD;
      at the University of Kansas Hospital in the 30 days prior to the study start date (3/25/2020)&#xD;
      and during the study period.&#xD;

      This is an open label, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of losartan in&#xD;
      respiratory failure due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial setup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. Briefly, 50 patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 and respiratory failure who meet criteria and agree to participation in the study&#xD;
      will be placed on losartan 25 mg daily on study day 0. If parameters are met the dose of&#xD;
      losartan will be increased to 50 mg once daily on study day 3. Participants will continue&#xD;
      losartan until they experience resolution of respiratory failure (normal oxygen levels on&#xD;
      room air), are discharged from the hospital, meet stoppage criteria (detailed below) or&#xD;
      complete 14 days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and/or surrogate decision maker who do not give consent to treatment will be asked&#xD;
      to allow collection of data from their medical record for use as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stoppage criteria for losartan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperkalemia (persistent values &gt;5.5 mM recorded on at least 2 readings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worsening renal function (Cockcroft-Gault &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or urinary output &lt;20&#xD;
           mL/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin rashes, palpitations or other moderate or severe adverse events (interference with&#xD;
           usual daily activities) without clear explanation should warrant immediate cessation of&#xD;
           treatment and notification of study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of sustained hypotension defined as SBP &lt;90 mmHg, DBP &lt;60 mmHg recorded on&#xD;
           at least two readings 30 min apart or use of norepinephrine &gt;0.1 µg/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any change in monitor lab parameters deemed significant and potentially related to study&#xD;
           drug by the Investigator.&#xD;

    <description>Safety will be reported based on Protocol defined AEs.&#xD;
For the purpose of this protocol, an AE will be defined as as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study listed under DMSB - Anticipated Adverse Events and Grading Scale section of this protocol as well as safety monitoring data listed on protocol table 1 as well as stoppage criteria for losartan.&#xD;
The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs will be collected for both study groups, treatment and control from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation.</description>
