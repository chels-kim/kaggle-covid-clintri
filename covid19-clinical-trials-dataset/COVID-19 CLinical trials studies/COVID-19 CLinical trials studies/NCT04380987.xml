  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Predi-COVID is a prospective cohort study composed of people positively tested for COVID-19&#xD;
      in Luxembourg, followed digitally for monitoring participants' health evolution and symptoms&#xD;
      at home. Participants will be actively followed for 14 days from the time of confirmation of&#xD;
      diagnosis, whether they are at the hospital or at home in isolation or quarantine. Short&#xD;
      evaluations will be also performed at week 3 and week 4 and then monthly for a period up to&#xD;
      12 months to assess potential long term consequences of COVID-19. A subsample of 200&#xD;
      participants will be contacted to integrate complementary clinical data and collect samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at identifying factors associated with the COVID-19 disease severity. COVID-19&#xD;
      patients with severity criteria will be compared to patients with mild disease managed at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deep phenotyping related to the symptoms of the disease as well as biosampling allowing for&#xD;
      laboratory-based and computational analytics will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to recruit virtually all COVID-19 positive persons in Luxembourg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sub-sample of a minimum of 200 COVID-19 positive persons in Predi-COVID study would allow&#xD;
      to find a risk ratio of severe disease above 2 for the selected risk factor with a power of&#xD;
      80% when the prevalence of the disease is above 7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every symptomatic adult tested positive by RTqPCR, biological samples will be collected&#xD;
      at the inclusion and as follow-up 3 weeks after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients at home, an experienced nurse from CIEC will perform the sampling, using all the&#xD;
      required precautions and protections in the actual context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hospitalised patients, a simplified sampling strategy will be put in place and adapted to&#xD;
      the patient state, the workload of staff and adapted constantly depending on the evolution of&#xD;
      the epidemy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through 3 different ways :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires : health status monitoring data with daily questionnaires during the 14&#xD;
           first days following diagnosis, weekly questionnaires at week 3 and 4 and monthly&#xD;
           questionnaires from month 2 to month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adapted ISARIC eCRF for patients at hospital (during all hospital stay) and at inclusion&#xD;
           for patients included from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Smartphone application (LIH in-house solution) : innovative data (voice recordings,&#xD;
           geolocation and mini-questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ancillary study will be added (Predi-COVID-H):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predi-COVID-H is an ancillary cohort study composed of Household members of index cases to&#xD;
      monitor symptoms and disease outbreak in this high-risk population. For every asymptomatic&#xD;
      member of the family of a &quot;case&quot; included in the Predi-COVID sub-sample (a &quot;contact&quot;),&#xD;
      clinical as well as socio-economic characteristics will be collected. Biological samples will&#xD;
      also be collected at the same time as the &quot;case&quot; visit by nurses and up to 30 ml of blood&#xD;
      will be taken at baseline, for serology. IgG and/or IgA seropositive &quot;contacts&quot; will be&#xD;
      proposed to be enrolled in the Predi-COVID study. For IgG and IgA seronegative &quot;contacts&quot;, a&#xD;
      second serology will be planned 2 weeks later, up to 30 mL of blood will be collected. If&#xD;
      they become IgG and/or IgA seropositive, they will be proposed to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      Predi-COVID study. IgG and IgA seronegative &quot;contacts&quot; will be followed digitally&#xD;
